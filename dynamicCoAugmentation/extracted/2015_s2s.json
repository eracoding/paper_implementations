    "title": "Variation in performance of candidate surgical quality measures for muscle-invasive bladder cancer by hospital type.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To test the association between hospital type and performance of candidate quality measures for treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) using a large national tumour registry. Proposed quality measures include receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, timely treatment, adequate lymph node dissection, and continent urinary diversion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the National Cancer Database, patients with stage >=II urothelial carcinoma treated with radical cystectomy (RC) from 2003 to 2010 were identified. Hospitals were grouped by type and annual RC volume: community, comprehensive low volume (CLV), comprehensive high volume (CHV), academic low volume (ALV), and academic high volume (AHV) groups. Logistic regression models were used to test the association between hospital group and performance of quality measures, adjusting for year, demographic, and clinical/pathological characteristics; generalised estimating equations were fitted to the models to adjust for clustering at the hospital level. RESULTS: In all, 23 279 patients underwent RC at community (12.4%), comprehensive (CLV 38%, CHV 5%), and academic (ALV 17%, AHV 28%) hospitals. While only 0.8% (175) of patients met all four quality criteria, 61% of patients treated at AHV hospitals met two or more quality metric indicators compared with ALV (45%), CHV (44%), CLV (38%), and community (37%) hospitals (P < 0.001). After adjustment, patients were more likely to receive two or more quality measures when treated at AHV (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, confidence interval [CI] 2.0-2.9), ALV (OR 1.3, CI 1.1-1.6), and CHV (OR 1.3, CI 1.03-1.7) hospitals compared with community hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing RC at AHV hospitals were more likely to meet quality criteria. However, performance remains low across hospital types, highlighting the opportunity to improve quality of care for MIBC.",

    "title": "Small vessel disease, but neither amyloid load nor metabolic deficit, is dependent on age at onset in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is controversy concerning whether Alzheimer's disease (AD) with early onset is distinct from AD with late onset with regard to amyloid pathology and neuronal metabolic deficit. We hypothesized that compared with patients with early-onset AD, patients with late-onset AD have more comorbid small vessel disease (SVD) contributing to clinical severity, whereas there are no differences in amyloid pathology and neuronal metabolic deficit. METHODS: The study included two groups of patients with probable AD dementia with evidence of the AD pathophysiologic process: 24 patients with age at onset <60 years old and 36 patients with age at onset >70 years old. Amyloid deposition was assessed using carbon-11-labeled Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography, comorbid SVD was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging, and neuronal metabolic deficit was assessed using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Group differences of global and regional distribution of pathology were explored using region of interest and voxel-based analyses, respectively, carefully controlling for the influence of dementia severity, apolipoprotein E genotype, and in particular SVD. The pattern of cognitive impairment was determined using z scores of the subtests of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Neuropsychological Assessment Battery. RESULTS: Patients with late-onset AD showed a significantly greater amount of SVD. No statistically significant differences in global or regional amyloid deposition or neuronal metabolic deficit between the two groups were revealed. However, when not controlling for SVD, subtle differences in fluorodeoxyglucose uptake between early-onset AD and late-onset AD groups were detectable. There were no significant differences regarding cognitive functioning. CONCLUSIONS: Age at onset does not influence amyloid deposition or neuronal metabolic deficit in AD. The greater extent of SVD in late-onset AD influences the association between neuronal metabolic deficit and clinical symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is thought to play a major role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. Environmental influences, including chronic bacterial or viral infections, are thought to alter the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and thereby facilitate cerebral colonization by opportunistic pathogens. This may eventually trigger Abeta overproduction and aggregation. Host biomolecules that target and combat these pathogens, for instance, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as Abeta itself, are an interesting option for the detection and diagnostic follow-up of such cerebral infections. As part of the innate immune system, AMPs are defensive peptides that efficiently penetrate infected cells and tissues beyond many endothelial barriers, most linings, including the BBB, and overall specifically target pathogens. Based on existing literature, we postulate a role for labeled AMPs as a marker to target pathogens that play a role in the aggregation of amyloid in the brain.",

    "title": "Do astrocytes collaborate with neurons in spreading the \"infectious\" abeta and Tau drivers of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "abstract": "Evidence has begun emerging for the \"contagious\" and destructive Abeta42 (amyloid-beta42) oligomers and phosphorylated Tau oligomers as drivers of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), which advances along a pathway starting from the brainstem or entorhinal cortex and leading to cognition-related upper cerebral cortex regions. Seemingly, Abeta42 oligomers trigger the events generating the neurotoxic Tau oligomers, which may even by themselves spread the characteristic AD neuropathology. It has been assumed that only neurons make and spread these toxic drivers, whereas their associated astrocytes are just janitorial bystanders/scavengers. But this view is likely to radically change since normal human astrocytes freshly isolated from adult cerebral cortex can be induced by exogenous Abeta25-35, an Abeta42 proxy, to make and secrete increased amounts of endogenous Abeta42. Thus, it would seem that the steady slow progression of AD neuropathology along specific cognition-relevant brain networks is driven by both Abeta42 and phosphorylated Tau oligomers that are variously released from increasing numbers of \"contagion-stricken\" members of tightly coupled neuron-astrocyte teams. Hence, we surmise that stopping the oversecretion and spread of the two kinds of \"contagious\" oligomers by such team members, perhaps via a specific CaSR (Ca(2+)-sensing receptor) antagonist like NPS 2143, might effectively treat AD.",

    "abstract": "Impaired olfaction has been described as an early symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Neuroanatomical changes underlying this deficit in the olfactory system are largely unknown. Interestingly, neuropathology begins in the transentorhinal cortex and extends to the neighboring limbic system and basal telencephalic structures that mediate olfactory processing, including the anterior olfactory nucleus and olfactory bulb. The human piriform cortex has been described as a crucial area in odor quality coding; disruption of this region mediates early olfactory deficits in Alzheimer's disease. Most neuropathological investigations have focused on the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, whereas the piriform cortex has largely been neglected. This work aims to characterize the expression of the neuropathological amyloid-beta peptide, tau protein and interneuron population markers (calretinin, parvalbumin and somatostatin) in the piriform cortex of ten Alzheimer-diagnosed (80.4 +- 8.3 years old) and five control (69.6 +- 11.1) cases. Here, we examined the distribution of different interneuronal markers as well as co-localization of interneurons and pathological markers. Results indicated preferential vulnerability of somatostatin- (p = 0.0001 < alpha = 0.05) and calretinin-positive (p = 0.013 < alpha = 0.05) cells that colocalized with amyloid-beta peptide, while the prevalence of parvalbumin-positive cells was increased (p = 0.045 < alpha = 0.05) in the Alzheimer's cases. These data may help to reveal the neural basis of olfactory deficits linked to Alzheimer's disease as well as to characterize neuronal populations preferentially vulnerable to neuropathology in regions critically involved in early stages of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Several potential disease-modifying drugs for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have failed to show any effect on disease progression in clinical trials, conceivably because the AD subjects are already too advanced to derive clinical benefit from treatment and because diagnosis based on clinical criteria alone introduces a high misdiagnosis rate. Thus, well-validated biomarkers for early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial. Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of the amyloid-beta (Abeta1-42) peptide, in combination with high total tau and phosphorylated tau, are sensitive and specific biomarkers highly predictive of progression to AD dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment. However, interlaboratory variations in the results seen with currently available immunoassays are of concern. Recent worldwide standardization efforts and quality control programs include standard operating procedures for both preanalytical (e.g., lumbar puncture and sample handling) and analytical (e.g., preparation of calibration curve) procedures. Efforts are also ongoing to develop highly reproducible assays on fully automated instruments. These global standardization and harmonization measures will provide the basis for the generalized international application of CSF biomarkers for both clinical trials and routine clinical diagnosis of AD.",

A thorough description of vascular variations of the anterior communicating artery complex seems to be lacking. The aim of this study was to describe the anatomical variations of the anterior communicating artery complex. METHODS: The study group consisted of 411 subjects (52.31% women), without any intracranial pathologies, that had undergone head computed tomography angiography. We used maximum intensity projections, volume rendering and multi planar reconstructions to study and classify the anatomical variations of the anterior communicating and anterior cerebral arteries. RESULTS: Male subjects had a significantly higher prevalence of the typical anterior communicating artery complex (59.69 vs. 46.05%; p < 0.01). The aplastic anterior communicating artery (23.26 vs. 15.88%; p = 0.04) and triple A2 segment of the anterior cerebral artery (1.86 vs. 0.00%; p = 0.05) were more common in women than in men.

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, compelling evidence has linked the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to defective intracellular trafficking of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Faulty APP trafficking results in an overproduction of Abeta peptides, which is generally agreed to be the primary cause of AD-related pathogenesis. LR11 (SorLA), a type I transmembrane sorting receptor, has emerged as a key regulator of APP trafficking and processing. It directly interacts with APP and diverts it away from amyloidogenic processing. The 54-residue cytosolic domain of LR11 is essential for its proper intracellular localization and trafficking which, in turn, determines the fate of APP. Here, we have found a surprising membrane-proximal amphipathic helix in the cytosolic domain of LR11. Moreover, a peptide corresponding to this region folds into an alpha-helical structure in the presence of liposomes and transforms liposomes to small vesicles and tubule-like particles. We postulate that this amphipathic helix may contribute to the dynamic remodeling of membrane structure and facilitate LR11 intracellular transport.",

    "abstract": "Cancer patients undergo routine clinical monitoring with an array of blood tests that may carry long-term prognostic information. We aimed to develop a new prognostic model predicting survival for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), based on laboratory tests commonly performed in clinical practice. A cohort of 1,161 stage IIIB or IV NSCLC patients was divided into training (n = 773) and testing (n = 388) cohorts. We analyzed the associations of 32 commonly tested laboratory variables with patient survival in the training cohort. We developed a model based on those significant laboratory variables, together with important clinical variables. The model was then evaluated in the testing cohort. Five variables, including albumin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, blood urea nitrogen and international normalized ratio, were significantly associated with patient survival after stepwise selection. A model incorporating these variables classified patients into low-, medium- and high-risk groups with median survival of 16.9, 7.2 and 2.1 months, respectively (p < 0.0001). Compared with low-risk group, patients in the medium- and high-risk groups had a significantly higher risk of death at 1 year, with hazard ratio (HR) of 1.95 (95% CI 1.62-2.36) and 5.22 (4.30-6.34), respectively. These results were validated in the testing cohort. Overall, we developed a prognostic model relying entirely on readily available variables, with similar predictive power to those which depend on more specialized and expensive molecular assays. Further study is necessary to validate and further refine this model, and compare its performance to models based on more specialized and expensive testing.",

    "title": "Monitoring the ability to deliver care in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review of health facility assessment tools.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Health facilities assessments are an essential instrument for health system strengthening in low- and middle-income countries. These assessments are used to conduct health facility censuses to assess the capacity of the health system to deliver health care and to identify gaps in the coverage of health services. Despite the valuable role of these assessments, there are currently no minimum standards or frameworks for these tools. METHODS: We used a structured keyword search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE and HealthStar databases and searched the websites of the World Health Organization, the World Bank and the International Health Facilities Assessment Network to locate all available health facilities assessment tools intended for use in low- and middle-income countries. We parsed the various assessment tools to identify similarities between them, which we catalogued into a framework comprising 41 assessment domains. RESULTS: We identified 10 health facility assessment tools meeting our inclusion criteria, all of which were included in our analysis. We found substantial variation in the comprehensiveness of the included tools, with the assessments containing indicators in 13 to 33 (median: 25.5) of the 41 assessment domains included in our framework. None of the tools collected data on all 41 of the assessment domains we identified. CONCLUSIONS: Not only do a large number of health facility assessment tools exist, but the data they collect and methods they employ are very different. This certainly limits the comparability of the data between different countries' health systems and probably creates blind spots that impede efforts to strengthen those systems. Agreement is needed on the essential elements of health facility assessments to guide the development of specific indicators and for refining existing instruments.",

    "title": "Trained or professional doulas in the support and care of pregnant and birthing women: a critical integrative review.",
    "abstract": "The professionalisation of doula care and research interest in this area of maternity care/support have both grown internationally in recent years highlighting important broader issues around the access, continuity and delivery of maternity care services. However, no work to date has provided a critical appraisal of the international literature on this topic. In response, this paper presents the first critical review of international empirical literature examining professional doula care for pregnant and birthing women. A database search of AMED, CINAHL, Maternity and Infant Care, and MEDLINE using the search term, \"doula\" was undertaken. A total of 48 papers published between 1980 and March 2013 involving trained or professional doulas were extracted. Four descriptive categories were identified from the review: 'workforce and professional issues in doula care'; 'trained or professional doula's role and skill'; 'physical outcomes of trained or professional doula care'; and 'social outcomes of trained or professional doula care'. Of the studies evaluating outcomes of doula care, there were a number with design and methodology weaknesses. The review highlights a number of gaps in the research literature including a lack of research examining doula workforce issues; focus upon the experience and perspective of significant stakeholders such as expectant fathers with regard to trained or professional doula care; clinical trials measuring both subjective experiences and physical outcomes of trained or professional doula support; synergy between the design of clinical trials research examining trained or professional doula care and the clinical reality of professional doula practice. It is imperative that key aspects of trained doula care be subject to further rigorous, empirical investigation to help establish an evidence base to guide policy and practice relating to this area of support and care for pregnant and birthing women.",

More recent advances in understanding of the human genome-technologic advances in methods to analyze millions of polymorphisms in thousands of subjects-have revealed new genes associated with AD risk, including ABCA7, BIN1, CASS4, CD33, CD2AP, CELF1, CLU, CR1, DSG2, EPHA1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB5-DBR1, INPP5D, MS4A, MEF2C, NME8, PICALM, PTK2B, SLC24H4-RIN3, SORL1, and ZCWPW1. Emerging technologies to analyze the entire genome in large data sets have also revealed coding variants that increase AD risk: PLD3 and TREM2. We review the relationship between these AD risk genes and the cellular and neuropathologic features of AD. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the association of these genes with risk for disease will provide the most meaningful targets for therapeutic development to date.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We assessed the clinical utility of beta-amyloid (Abeta) imaging with (18)F-florbetaben (FBB) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by evaluating its prognostic accuracy for progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD), comparing semiquantitative with visual scan assessment, and exploring the relationships among Abeta, hippocampal volume (HV) and memory over time. METHODS: 45 MCI underwent FBB positron emission tomography, MRI and neuropsychological assessment at baseline and 2 years and clinical follow-up at 4 years. Positive FBB (FBB+), defined by a cortical to cerebellar cortex standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR) >= 1.45, was compared with visual assessment by five readers. Amnestic MCI (aMCI) was defined by a composite episodic memory (EM) Z-score of <-1.5. RESULTS: At baseline, 24 (53%) MCI were FBB+. Majority reads agreed with SUVR classification (kappa 0.96). In 2 years, 18 (75%) FBB+ progressed to AD compared with 2 (9.5%) FBB-, yielding a predictive accuracy of 83% (95% CI 61% to 94%). Four FBB- developed non-AD dementia. Predictive accuracies of HV (58% (95% CI 42% to 73%)) and aMCI status (73% (95% CI 58% to 81%)) were lower. Combinations did not improve accuracy. By 4 years, 21 (87.5%) FBB+ had AD whereas 5 (24%) FBB- had non-AD dementia yielding a predictive accuracy of 94% (95% CI 74% to 99%). While the strong baseline association between FBB SUVR and EM declined over 2 years, the association between EM and HV became stronger. FBB SUVR increased 2.2%/year in FBB+ with no change in FBB-. CONCLUSIONS: (18)F-florbetaben Abeta imaging facilitates accurate detection of prodromal AD. As neurodegeneration progresses, and in contrast with the early stages of the disease, hippocampal atrophy and not Abeta, seems to drive memory decline. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01138111.",

    "abstract": "Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1-interacting (ASK1-interacting) protein-1 (AIP1) is a newly identified novel member of the Ras GTPase-activating protein family, which has been implicated in cell growth inhibition and cell apoptosis. However, the effects of AIP1 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are unknown. In the present study, we found that AIP1 was elevated in the brain of AD Tg2576 mice and Abeta1-42 treated brain cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (CECs). Abeta1-42 treatment induced the interaction of AIP1 and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which led to dissociation of ASK1 and its inhibitor 14-3-3. Dissociation of ASK1 from 14-3-3 leads to ASK1 activation. Indeed, Abeta1-42 dephosphorylated ASK1 at Ser-967, suggesting that Abeta1-42 increased ASK1 activity. Importantly, disassociation of ASK1 and 14-3-3 induced by Abeta1-42 could be rescued by silence of AIP1. In addition, down-regulation of AIP1 also led to attenuation of the activation of JNK, as well as p53, downstream signaling targets of ASK1. AIP1 silencing attenuated the pro-apoptotic effects of Abeta1-42 on CECs. We propose that AIP1 mediates Abeta induced ASK1 activation by facilitating dissociation of 14-3-3, suggesting a novel mechanism for Abeta-induced apoptosis in CECs.",

RESULTS: MSRA-1 specifically reduces oxidized methionines in proteins. Therefore, a deletion of the msra-1 gene was introduced into transgenic C. elegans worms that express the Abeta-peptide in muscle cells to prevent the reduction of oxidized methionines in proteins. In a constitutive transgenic Abeta strain that lacks MSRA-1, the number of amyloid aggregates decreases while the number of oligomeric Abeta species increases. These results correlate with enhanced synaptic dysfunction and mislocalization of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ACR-16 at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). INNOVATION: This approach aims at modulating the oxidation of Abeta in vivo indirectly by dismantling the methionine sulfoxide repair system. The evidence presented here shows that the absence of MSRA-1 influences Abeta aggregation and aggravates locomotor behavior and NMJ dysfunction. The results suggest that therapies which boost the activity of the Msr system could have a beneficial effect in managing amyloidogenic pathologies. CONCLUSION: The absence of MSRA-1 modulates Abeta-peptide aggregation and increments its deleterious effects in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta pathology (Abeta) and impaired cognition characterize Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, neural mechanisms that link Abeta-pathology with impaired cognition are incompletely understood. Large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) are potential candidates for this link: Abeta-pathology affects specific networks in early AD, these networks show disrupted connectivity, and they process specific cognitive functions impaired in AD, like memory or attention. We hypothesized that, in AD, regional changes of ICNs, which persist across rest- and cognitive task-states, might link Abeta-pathology with impaired cognition via impaired intrinsic connectivity. Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-positron emission tomography reflecting in vivo Abeta-pathology, resting-state fMRI, task-fMRI, and cognitive testing were used in patients with prodromal AD and healthy controls. In patients, default mode network's (DMN) functional connectivity (FC) was reduced in the medial parietal cortex during rest relative to healthy controls, relatively increased in the same region during an attention-demanding task, and associated with patients' cognitive impairment. Local PiB-uptake correlated negatively with DMN connectivity. Importantly, corresponding results were found for the right lateral parietal region of an attentional network. Finally, structural equation modeling confirmed a direct influence of DMN resting-state FC on the association between Abeta-pathology and cognitive impairment. Data provide evidence that disrupted intrinsic network connectivity links Abeta-pathology with cognitive impairment in early AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common dementia, which is not effectively cured to date. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition cascade and disintegrity of brain extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold attribute to the progress of AD. Thus, it maybe an effective way to treat AD by altering the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and regaining the integrity of ECM. The peptide amphiphile (PA) with a laminin epitope isoleucine-lysine-valine-alanine-valine (IKVAV) (IKVAV-PA) can be trigged into ECM in vivo. In addition, IKVAV-PA could significantly improve cognitive impairment with remarkable increase of endoneurogensis in the hippocampus, as well as reduction of burden of amyloid plaque in the brain. METHODS: We used heterozygous AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice as the animal model of AD. After 1 week of initial stereotaxic administration into bilateral hippocampus, the mice were subjected to the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test. At the end of MWM test, immunohistochemical staining, Western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed in mice. RESULTS: Here we showed that IKVAV-PA significantly improved cognitive impairment accompanying with reducing the burden of Abeta plaques, as well as the levels of soluble Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 in the cortex and hippocampus after 2 weeks of initial administration into bilateral hippocampus. Further examination demonstrated that IKVAV-PA also altered the processing of APP via inhibiting the gene expression of beta-secretase (BACE1), as well as improving the gene expression of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and neprilysin (NEP). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that IKVAV-PA may serve as an alternative therapeutic intervention for treating the learning and memory losses in AD.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The amyloid hypothesis stimulates the discovery of compounds, which promotes beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) clearance, thereby altering the underlying pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, the present study aims at the evaluation of anti-amyloidogenic potential of Gelidiella acerosa. METHODS: Prevention of Abeta 25-35 aggregate formation and disaggregation of pre-formed fibrils by G. acerosa was evaluated in three phases by thioflavin T spectrophotometric assay. The results were further validated by confocal microscopic analysis. The conformational changes in the aggregated and non-aggregated Abeta in the presence of G. acerosa were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis. RESULTS: Phase-I study shows that G. acerosa reverts (4.56 +- 0.35 AU at 96 hours) the increase in fluorescence intensity of aggregated Abeta (18.76 +- 0.99 AU) significantly (P < 0.05) as that of non-aggregated peptides, which suggests that G. acerosa prevents the formation of oligomers from monomers. The seaweed also prevents the fibril formation even after the aggregation process was initiated at 20 hours, which was verified by the significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the fluorescence intensity (2.94 +- 0.0721 AU) at 36 hours (Phase II). In addition, G. acerosa promotes fibrillar destabilization (Phase III), which was further substantiated by confocal microscopic analysis. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals that alteration in amide I and amide II band spectrum, which occurs due to Abeta 25-35 aggregation was restored upon co-treatment with G. acerosa benzene extract. CONCLUSION: Overall, the results suggest that G. acerosa might have direct interaction with the aggregated peptide, thereby preventing oligomerization and fibrillation of Abeta 25-35.",

Eighty-four AD patients underwent an assessment of vascular risk (blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack [TIA], or stroke) and later underwent brain autopsy. Given our aim to examine mild cerebrovascular changes (CVCs), individuals were excluded if autopsy revealed large stroke. The most common forms of CVC were circle of Willis atherosclerosis followed by arteriosclerosis, lacunes, and microinfarcts. Excluding the history of TIA/clinical stroke, individual vascular risk factors were not associated with CVC. However, the presence of multiple vascular risk factors was associated with CVC. Furthermore, the presence of CVC was associated with lower Braak and Braak stage. These findings highlight the importance of aggregate risk in the vascular contribution to dementia.

METHODS: Analyses were based on 1254 participants randomly selected from the initial 3C cohort stratified by center, sex, and age in the context of a nested case-cohort study to investigate biological variables. Associations between plasma Abeta and mortality were assessed with the Cox regression model with delayed entry including various potential confounding factors and testing possible mediators. RESULTS: A relationship between high plasma Abeta1-40 concentrations and risk of mortality (hazards ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.31, P = .03) was unveiled independently of age, educational level, vascular risk factors, diet, physical activity, cognitive impairment, or frailty status. It was only modified when we included cystatin C levels. CONCLUSIONS: Further investigations are needed to determine precisely the pathophysiological roles of plasma Abeta1-40 and cystatin C and before envisioning any future clinical applications.",

This study was designed to investigate the neuroprotection of sulforaphane (SFN) in AD-lesion mice induced by combined administration of d-galactose and aluminium. Results showed that SFN ameliorated spatial cognitive impairment and locomotor activity decrease in Morris water maze and open field test, respectively. And attenuated numbers of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques in both hippocampus and cerebral cortex of AD-lesion mice were detected by immunohistochemistry. According to spectrophotometry and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results, a significant increase in carbonyl group level and obvious decreases in both activity and messenger RNA expression of glutathione peroxidase were found in brain of AD-lesion mice compared with control, but not in SFN-treated AD-lesion mice. In conclusion, SFN ameliorates neurobehavioral deficits and protects the brain from Abeta deposits and peroxidation in mice with Alzheimer-like lesions, suggesting SFN is likely a potential phytochemical to be used in AD therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Lymphopenia as a likely index of poor systemic immunity is an independent predictor of inferior outcome in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We sought to evaluate the prognostic relevance of preoperative absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in a cohort of patients with papillary RCC (PRCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospectively maintained, renal cancer database was analyzed. Patients with preoperative ALC, within 3 months before surgery, were eligible for the study. Those with multifocal or bilateral renal tumors were excluded. Correlations between ALC and age, gender, smoking, Charlson comorbidity index, pathologic T category, PRCC subtype, and TNM stage were evaluated. Differences in overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival by ALC status were assessed using the log-rank test and cumulative incident estimators, respectively. Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariable analyses. RESULTS: A total of 192 patients met the inclusion criteria. As a continuous variable, preoperative ALC was associated with higher TNM stage (P = 0.001) and older age (P = 0.01). As a dichotomous variable, lymphopenia (<1,300 cells/microl) was associated with higher TNM stage (P = 0.003). On multivariable analyses, controlling for covariates, after a median follow-up of 37.3 months, lymphopenia was associated with inferior OS (hazard ratio = 2.3 [95% CI: 1.2-4.3], P = 0.011) and trended to significance for cancer-specific survival (P = 0.071). Among patients with nonmetastatic disease and lymphopenia, OS at 37.5 months was shorter compared with those with normal ALC (83% vs. 93%, P = 0.0006). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PRCC, lymphopenia is associated with lower survival independent of TNM stage, age, and histology. ALC may provide an additional preoperative prognostic factor.",

Alteration of olfactory neuroepithelium associated with MCI may be useful as predictor of cognitive decline.

In this study, magnetic resonance images, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) load, Olfactory Connecticut test and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) indices were obtained from noncognitive impaired (NCI), MCI and AD patients. We established a culture of patient-derived olfactory stromal cells from biopsies of olfactory mucosa (OM) to test whether biological properties of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are concurrent with MCI and AD psychophysical pathology. We determined the expression of amyloid Abeta peptides in the neuroepithelium of tissue sections from MCI and AD, as well as in cultured cells of OM. Reduced migration and proliferation of stromal (CD90(+) ) cells in MCI and AD with respect to NCI patients was determined. A higher proportion of anosmic MCI and AD cases were concurrent with the ApoE epsilon4 allele. In summary, dysmetabolism of amyloid was concurrent with migration and proliferation impairment of patient-derived stem cells.",

IR is related to greater amyloid burden post-mortem and increased deposition within areas affected by early AD. No studies have examined if IR is associated with an in vivo index of amyloid in the human brain in late middle-aged participants at risk for AD. METHODS: Asymptomatic, late middle-aged adults (N = 186) from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention underwent [C-11]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography. The cross-sectional design tested the interaction between insulin resistance and glycemic status on PiB distribution volume ratio in three regions of interest (frontal, parietal, and temporal). RESULTS: In participants with normoglycemia but not hyperglycemia, higher insulin resistance corresponded to higher PiB uptake in frontal and temporal areas, reflecting increased amyloid deposition.

In clinical AD, increased PCC concentrations of Abeta were observed for all Abeta forms in the insoluble pool but only for Abeta1-42 in the soluble pool. Lower Mini-Mental State Exam and episodic memory scores correlated most strongly with higher concentrations of soluble and insoluble Abeta1-42. Greater neuropathology severity by Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease and National Institute on Aging-Reagan pathologic criteria was associated with higher concentrations of all measured Abeta forms, except soluble AbetaNpE3-40.

In the present study we have examined the protective effects of Borago Officinalis (borage) extract on amyloid beta (Abeta)--Induced long term potentiation (LTP) disruption in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Wistar male rats received intrahippocampal (IHP) injection of the Abeta (25-35) and borage extract throughout gestation (100 mg/kg). LTP in perforant path- DG synapses was assessed using electrophysiology method and field excitatory post- synaptic potential (fEPSP) slope and population spike (PS) amplitude were measured by 400 Hz tetanization. Finally, the total thiol content of hippocampus was measured using colorimetric reaction based on the Ellman's method. The results showed that Abeta (25-35) significantly decreased fEPSP slope and SP amplitude comparing with the control and sham group, whereas borage extract administration increased these parameters compared to the Abeta group. Abeta induced a remarkable decrease in total thiol content of hippocampus and borage prevented the decrease of the hippocampal total sulfhydryl (SH) groups. This data suggest that Abeta (25-35) can effectively inhibit LTP in the granular cells of the DG in hippocampus, and borage supplementation reverse the synaptic plasticity in DG following Abeta treatment and that borage consumption may lead to an improvement of AD-induced cognitive dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "This work was prompted by the finding that Abeta1-17 (Abeta17) appeared to be the second-most abundant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta fragment, after Abeta40. We developed an ELISA to quantify levels of Abeta17 directly accessible in plasma (DA17), recovered from the proteomic plasma matrix (RP17) and associated with the cellular pellet (CP17) that remained after plasma collection. Then, we used a sample of 19 healthy control (HC), 27 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 17 mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients to explore the association of the diagnostic groups with those direct markers, their ratios or the ratios with their Abeta40 or Abeta42 counterparts. After dichotomization (d) for the median of the sample population, logistic regression analysis showed that in the AD versus HC subgroup, subjects with a dDA/CP17 higher than the median had a significantly greater risk of being AD than those with marker levels equal to or below the median (odds ratio OR; 95% confidence interval; 17.21; 1.42-208.81). Subjects with dRP17/42 below the median had an increased likelihood of being MCI (20.00; 1.17-333.33) or AD (40.00; 1.87-1000) versus being HC, than those with dRP17/42 higher than the median. Although the confidence intervals are wide, these findings suggest that assessment of Abeta17 may increase the diagnostic performance of blood-based Abeta tests which might be developed into minimally invasive first-step screening tests for people with increased risk for AD.",

    "abstract": "The protective effect of physical activity on arteries is not limited to coronary vessels, but extends to the whole arterial system, including arteries, in which endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerotic changes are one of the key factors affecting erectile dysfunction development. The objective of this study was to report whether the endurance training intensity and training-induced chronotropic response are linked with a change in erectile dysfunction intensity in men with ischemic heart disease. A total of 150 men treated for ischemic heart disease, who suffered from erectile dysfunction, were analyzed. The study group consisted of 115 patients who were subjected to a cardiac rehabilitation program. The control group consisted of 35 patients who were not subjected to any cardiac rehabilitation. An IIEF-5 (International Index of Erectile Function) questionnaire was used for determining erectile dysfunction before and after cardiac rehabilitation. Cardiac training intensity was objectified by parameters describing work of endurance training. The mean initial intensity of erectile dysfunction in the study group was 12.46 +- 6.01 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.35-13.57). Final erectile dysfunction intensity (EDI) assessed after the cardiac rehabilitation program in the study group was 14.35 +- 6.88 (95% CI = 13.08-15.62), and it was statistically significantly greater from initial EDI. Mean final training work was statistically significantly greater than mean initial training work. From among the parameters describing training work, none were related significantly to reduction of EDI. In conclusion, cardiac rehabilitation program-induced improvement in erection severity is not correlated with endurance training intensity. Chronotropic response during exercise may be used for initial assessment of change in cardiac rehabilitation program-induced erection severity.",

A growing body of evidence suggests better diagnostic performance of the amyloid-beta (Abeta)42/40 CSF concentration ratio compared to the Abeta42 concentration alone. OBJECTIVE: (a) to analytically validate two novel ELISAs capable to measure Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 in the CSF, and (b) to compare the diagnostic accuracies of Abeta1-42 and Abeta42/40 ratio. METHODS: In this study, (a) the novel Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 ELISAs (IBL International GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) have been analytically validated, and (b) a clinical study has been performed comparing the diagnostic performance of the CSF Abeta42/40 concentration ratio and the CSF Abeta42 concentration. RESULTS: In the analytical part of the study, only marginal cross-reactivity (Abeta1-42 versus Abeta1-40) was observed; recoveries were in the range of 85-100% for the samples diluted 1 : 20-1 : 640 (Abeta1-40), and 92-104% for the samples diluted 1 : 20-1 : 320 (Abeta1-42). For Abeta1-40, the intra-assay imprecision was 2.1%, the inter-assay imprecision was 4.4%, and the inter-lot imprecision was 5.4 %. For Abeta1-42, the numbers were 3.1%, 6.2%, and 6.9%, respectively. The goodness of the fit of the average standard curves was >0.99 for both assays, and the imprecision of the optical densities in ten repetitions of the standard curves was <=5% for all standards. In the clinical part, at the cut off value 691 pg/mL, Abeta1-42 showed sensitivity and specificity of 69.3% and 88.9%, respectively, whereas at the cut off value 0.06, the Abeta42/40 ratio showed significantly improved performance with sensitivity and specificity of 93.3% and 100%, respectively. The area under the ROC curve for Abeta42/40 (0.974) was highly significantly larger compared to Abeta1-42 concentration ROC curve (0.827, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: (a) the novel Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 ELISA assays characterize with very good analytical performance; (b) we reconfirm that the CSF Abeta42/40 concentration ratio shows significantly better diagnostic performance compared to the CSF Abeta1-42 concentration alone.",

Therefore, inhibition of Abeta42 aggregation holds great promise for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease. To this end, we used a systematic in vitro evolution including a paired peptide library method. We identified two peptides with high binding affinity (with Kd in the nm range) for Abeta42. Functionally, these peptides strongly inhibited the aggregation of Abeta42 as shown by the thioflavin T assay and atomic force microscopy. Moreover, these peptides rescued PC12 cells from the cytotoxic effect of aggregated Abeta42 in vitro. Our results suggest that these novel peptides may be potential therapeutic seeds for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

Immune senescence with aging has also played a crucial role in AD pathogenesis and influences the effect of anti-Abeta immunotherapy. In this study, a combined treatment of Abeta1-42-bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) with intraperitoneal injection of splenocytes from young mice was designed as a novel immunotherapy for AD in APPswe/PSEN1de9 transgenic mice models. The results showed that the combined treatment not only elevated the level of anti-Abeta antibodies but also reduced amyloid plaques in brain and finally ameliorated deterioration of spatial learning and memory in AD mice. Additionally, the results revealed an increase of CD68 positive microglial cells in the vicinity of amyloid plaques in the mouse brain, which was responsible for the enhanced phagocytosis of Abeta plaques. In conclusion, the Abeta1-42-BMDCs plus splenocytes treatment improved the phagocytosis of microglia and prevented AD pathology more effectively. This combined immunotherapy provided a promising treatment in preventing the progression of AD in clinical studies in the near future.",

However, little is known about the mechanisms by which these loci influence AD pathogenesis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the individual and combined risk effects of the newly identified AD loci. METHODS: Association of 12 AD risk loci with AD and AD-related cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers was assessed. Furthermore, a polygenic risk score combining the effect sizes of the top 22 risk loci in AD was calculated for each individual among the clinical and neuropathological cohorts. Effects of individual risk loci and polygenic risk scores were assessed in relation to CSF biomarker levels as well as neurofibrillary pathology and different biochemical measures related to AD pathogenesis obtained from the temporal cortex. RESULTS: Polygenic risk scores associated with CSF amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42) levels in the clinical cohort, and with soluble Abeta42 levels and gamma-secretase activity in the neuropathological cohort. The gamma-secretase effect was independent of APOE. APOE-epsilon4 associated with CSF Abeta42 (p < 0.001) levels. For the other risk loci, no significant associations with AD risk or CSF biomarkers were detected after multiple testing correction. CONCLUSIONS: AD risk loci polygenically contribute to Abeta pathology in the CSF and temporal cortex, and this effect is potentially associated with increased gamma-secretase activity.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has good preclinical support from transgenic mouse models and clinical data suggesting that a long-term treatment effect is possible. Soluble Abeta protofibrils have been shown to exhibit neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo, and constitute an attractive target for immunotherapy. Here, we demonstrate that the humanized antibody BAN2401 and its murine version mAb158 exhibit a strong binding preference for Abeta protofibrils over Abeta monomers. Further, we confirm the presence of the target by showing that both antibodies efficiently immunoprecipitate soluble Abeta aggregates in human AD brain extracts. mAb158 reached the brain and reduced the brain protofibril levels by 42% in an exposure-dependent manner both after long-term and short-term treatment in tg-ArcSwe mice. Notably, a 53% reduction of protofibrils/oligomers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that correlated with reduced brain protofibril levels was observed after long-term treatment, suggesting that CSF protofibrils/oligomers could be used as a potential biomarker. No change in native monomeric Abeta42 could be observed in brain TBS extracts after mAb158-treatment in tg-ArcSwe mice. By confirming the specific ability of mAb158 to selectively bind and reduce soluble Abeta protofibrils, with minimal binding to Abeta monomers, we provide further support in favor of its position as an attractive new candidate for AD immunotherapy.

    "abstract": "We have previously reported that tolfenamic acid treatment decreases the amyloidogenic proteins in C57BL/6 and in old hemizygous R1.40 transgenic mice via the degradation of the transcription factor specificity 1 protein (Sp1). The lowering of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) and amyloid-beta (Abeta) in hemizygous R1.40 transgenic mice was accompanied by reversal of the identified spatial reference and working memory deficits observed in the mouse model. In this study, we examined the ability of tolfenamic acid to reduce the amyloid plaque burden, as well as to ameliorate spatial learning and memory deficits in homozygous R1.40 mice. Results from immunohistochemical analysis indicated that tolfenamic acid treatment resulted in a profound decrease in cerebral Abeta plaque burden that was accompanied by improvements in spatial working memory assessed by spontaneous alternation ratio in the Y-maze. These results provide further evidence that tolfenamic acid could be utilized as a repurposed drug to modify Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the co-occurrence of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and intraneuronal neurofibrillary changes composed of abnormal tau. Over the last decades, the concept emerged that neurofibrillary changes progress in a hierarchical manner from mesial temporal structures through the associative neocortex to primary sensory and motor fields, paralleling cognitive deterioration closer than Abeta. The observation that two patients (one cognitively normal, one with dementia) exhibited neurofibrillary changes closely overlapping as regards their entity and topographic distribution but differed for characteristics of Abeta deposition suggests that the latter may directly contribute in determining cognitive impairment in AD.",

Recent findings suggest that Abeta is generated intracellularly and potential production sites include endosomes and trans-Golgi network. We determined the production of Abeta in subcellular fractions isolated from mouse brain. We found that a considerable amount of Abeta is produced at mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contact sites including outer mitochondrial membrane and mitochondria-associated ER membranes. Enhanced Abeta production at this site may disturb ER, mitochondrial and mitochondria-ER contact site function. This may be one key step in the cascade of events eventually leading to neurodegeneration in AD.",

The neuroprotective effects of baicalin on pathological changes and behavioral deficits were explored in a mouse model of amyloid beta (Abeta)(1-42) protein-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mice received a bilateral injection of Abeta(1-42) protein into the hippocampus, then they were treated with baicalin (30, 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight, orally) or Tween 80. The therapeutic effects of baicalin were monitored by Morris water maze trial and probe test. Then mice were sacrificed for immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. After a relatively short-term treatment of 14 days, 100 mg/kg of baicalin significantly ameliorated memory impairment in the Morris water maze test and probe test, and also attenuated glial cell activations and increase of TNF-alpha and IL-6 expressions induced by Abeta(1-42) protein. These results suggest that baicalin ameliorated Abeta(1-42) protein-related pathology and cognitive dysfunction via its anti-neuroinflammatory activity, and may be a potential candidate for the treatment of AD.",

However, the relationships among the genetic variations at these loci and clinical progression of the disease have not been fully explored. In the present study, we examined the relationships of 22 known LOAD genes to the progression of AD in 680 AD patients recruited from the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Patients were classified as \"rapid progressors\" if the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) changed >=3 points in 12 months and \"slow progressors\" if the MMSE changed <=2 points. We also performed a genome-wide association study in this cohort in an effort to identify new loci for AD progression. Association analysis between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the progression status of the AD cases was performed using logistic regression model controlled for age, gender, dementia medication use, psychosis, and hypertension. While no significant association was observed with either APOE*4 (p = 0.94) or APOE*2 (p = 0.33) with AD progression, we found multiple nominally significant associations (p < 0.05) either within or adjacent to seven known LOAD genes (INPP5D, MEF2C, TREM2, EPHA1, PTK2B, FERMT2, and CASS4) that harbor both risk and protective SNPs. Genome-wide association analyses identified four suggestive loci (PAX3, CCRN4L, PIGQ, and ADAM19) at p < 1E-05. Our data suggest that short-term clinical disease progression in AD has a genetic basis. Better understanding of these genetic factors could help to improve clinical trial design and potentially affect the development of disease modifying therapies.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging is a powerful research tool to characterize amyloid evolution in the brain. Quantification of amyloid load critically depends on (i) the choice of a reference region (RR) and (ii) on the selection of regions of interest (ROIs) to derive the standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the stability, i.e., negligible amyloid accumulation over time, of different RRs, and the performance of different PiB summary measures defined by selected ROIs and RRs for their sensitivity to detecting longitudinal change in amyloid burden. METHODS: To evaluate RRs, cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of focal regional and composite measures of amyloid accumulation were carried out on the standardized PiB-PET regional data for cerebellar grey matter (CER), subcortical white matter (SWM), and pons (PON). RRs and candidate composite SUVR measures were further evaluated to select regions and develop novel composites, using standardized 2-year change from baseline. RESULTS: Longitudinal trajectories of PiB4-average of anterior cingulate (ACG), frontal cortex (FRC), parietal cortex, and precuneus-demonstrated marked variability and small change from baseline when normalized to CER, larger changes and less variability when normalized to SWM, which was further enhanced for the composite in PON-normalized settings. Novel composite PiB3, comprised of the average SUVRs of lateral temporal cortex, ACG, and FRC was created. CONCLUSION: PON and SWM appeared to be more stable RRs than the CER. PiB3 showed compelling sample size reduction and gains in power calculations for clinical trials over conventional PiB4 composite.",

However, relationships between subjective cognitive impairment, objectively measured cognitive function, and amyloid-beta (Abeta) biomarkers remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which impairment or decline in subjective and informant rated cognitive impairment was associated with memory in healthy older adults with high Abeta. METHODS: Healthy older adults (n = 289) enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study were studied at baseline. Pittsburgh Compound B was used to determine Abeta status at baseline. At baseline and 18 months assessments, subjective memory impairment was assessed using the Memory Complaint Questionnaire and the Short Form of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly. Cognition was measured using the Cogstate Brief Battery. RESULTS: At baseline, there were no differences between low and high Abeta groups in subjective or informant-rated cognitive impairment, depressive and anxiety symptoms, or cognitive function. Longitudinal analyses showed moderate decline in learning and working memory over the 18 months in the high Abeta group. However there was no change over time in subjective or informant-rated cognitive impairment, depressive and anxiety symptoms, or cognition in either Abeta group. CONCLUSIONS: Although healthy older adults with high Abeta levels show decline in learning and working memory over 18 months, subjective or informant ratings of cognitive impairment do not change over the same period suggesting subjective cognitive impairment may have limited utility for the very early identification of AD.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether poor nutrition is associated with mortality in patients undergoing cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multi-institutional review of prospective databases identified 246 patients meeting inclusion criteria who underwent CN for mRCC from 1993 to 2012. Nutritional markers evaluated were: body mass index <18.5 kg/m(2) , serum albumin <3.5 g/dL, or preoperative weight loss of >=5% of body weight. Primary outcomes were overall (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Secondary outcome was 'early mortality' defined as death at <=6 months of surgery. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and multivariate analysis using logistic regression was used to test associations between nutritional markers and survival outcomes. RESULTS: In all, 119 patients (median follow-up 17 months) were categorised as having any abnormal nutrition parameter (48%). Hypoalbuminaemia was the only independent predictor of OS and DSS (OS: median 8 vs 23 months, P < 0.001; DSS: 11 vs 33 months, P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, hypoalbuminaemia remained a significant predictor of death for both overall [hazard ratio (HR) 2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-2.8; P < 0.001) and disease-specific mortality (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.3; P < 0.001). Hypoalbuminaemia was also associated with early mortality (overall: P < 0.001 and disease specific: P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Patients with mRCC and hypoalbuminaemia undergoing CN have decreased OS and CSS, and increased risk of all-cause and disease-specific early mortality. As such, serum albumin may help risk stratify patients selected as candidates for CN. Furthermore, future work should evaluate whether nutritional depletion is a modifiable risk factor.",

    "title": "Is brain copper deficiency in Alzheimer's, Lewy body, and Creutzfeldt Jakob diseases the common key for a free radical mechanism and oxidative stress-induced damage?",
    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's (AD), Lewy body (LBD), and Creutzfeldt Jakob (CJD) diseases, similar pathological hallmarks have been described, one of which is brain deposition of abnormal protease-resistant proteins. For these pathologies, copper bound to proteins is able to protect against free radicals by reduction from cupric Cu++ to cupreous Cu+. We have previously demonstrated in bovine brain homogenate that free radicals produce proteinase K-resistant prion after manganese is substituted for copper. Since low brain copper levels have been described in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, in substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease, and in various brain regions in AD, LBD, and CJD, a mechanism has been proposed that may underlie the neurodegenerative processes that occur when copper protection against free radicals is impaired. In peptide sequences, the alpha acid proton near the peptide bond is highly mobile and can be pulled out by free radicals. It will produce a trivalent alpha-carbon radical and induce a free radical chain process that will generate a D-amino acid configuration in the peptide sequence. Since only L-amino acids are physiologically present in mammalian (human) proteins, it may be supposed that only physiological L-peptides can be recycled by physiological enzymes such as proteases. If a D-amino acid is found in the peptide sequence subsequent to deficient copper protection against free radicals, it will not be recognized and might alter the proteasome L-amino acid recycling from brain peptides. In the brain, there will result an accumulation of abnormal protease-resistant proteins such as those observed in AD, LBD, and CJD.",

    "title": "ABCA5 regulates amyloid-beta peptide production and is associated with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology.",
    "abstract": "Brain cholesterol homeostasis is regulated by a group of proteins called ATP-binding cassette subfamily A (ABCA) transporters. Certain ABCA transporters regulate amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) processing to generate amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) and are associated with an increased risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). ABCA5 is a little-known member of the ABCA subfamily with no known function. In this study we undertook a comprehensive analysis of ABCA5 expression in the human and mouse brains. We explored the potential role of ABCA5 in AbetaPP processing associated with AD pathology. ABCA5 was differentially expressed in multiple regions of both human and mouse brains. It was strongly expressed in neurons with only weak expression in microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. ABCA5 was able to stimulate cholesterol efflux in neurons. ABCA5 expression was specifically elevated in the hippocampus of AD brains. Using two in vitro cell systems we demonstrated that ABCA5 reduces Abeta production, both Abeta40 and Abeta42, without altering AbetaPP mRNA and protein levels, indicating that the decrease in the Abeta levels was due to changes in AbetaPP processing and not AbetaPP expression. This report represents the first extensive expression and functional study of ABCA5 in the human brain and our data suggest a plausible function of ABCA5 in the brain as a cholesterol transporter associated with Abeta generation, information that may offer a potential new target for controlling Abeta levels in the brain.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Apolipoprotein E plays a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma level alterations have been reported in AD patients. In search of a potential biomarker, which would be predictive of cognitive, functional, or motor decline, we analyzed CSF apolipoprotein E (ApoE) levels of AD patients in this regard. METHODS: Subjects with newly diagnosed AD enrolled into an observational study were followed up longitudinally. Neuropsychological testing and physical examination were performed annually. In a sub-cohort of patients, where baseline CSF ApoE concentration values were available, multiple regression analyses were used to determine possible associations of CSF ApoE concentration and speed of decline on different cognitive, functional, and motor scales (MMSE, iADL, bADL, GDS, UPDRSIII) adjusting for possible confounders. RESULTS: No association of CSF ApoE levels and speed of decline on the various scales could be established (p = 0.09 to 0.88). Nevertheless, the use of neuroleptic drugs could be linked to higher velocity of global and extrapyramidal deterioration (p = 0.04 and 0.05 for GDS and UPDRSIII, respectively), but not to other outcomes (MMSE, bADL, and iADL). CONCLUSION: Herein, CSF ApoE at time of AD diagnosis could not be shown to be a viable biomarker for future cognitive, functional, or motor decline. Expectedly, the use of neuroleptic drugs was associated with detrimental effects.",

    "title": "Restoration of lipoxin A4 signaling reduces Alzheimer's disease-like pathology in the 3xTg-AD mouse model.",
    "abstract": "The initiation of an inflammatory response is critical to the survival of an organism. However, when inflammation fails to reach resolution, a chronic inflammatory state may occur, potentially leading to bystander tissue damage. Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic inflammation contributes to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and identifying mechanisms to resolve the pro-inflammatory environment stimulated by AD pathology remains an area of active investigation. Previously, we found that treatment with the pro-resolving mediator aspirin-triggered lipoxin A4 (ATL), improved cognition, reduced Abeta levels, and enhanced microglia phagocytic activity in Tg2576 transgenic AD mice. Here, we evaluated the effect of aging on brain lipoxin A4 (LXA4) levels using non-transgenic and 3xTg-AD mice. Additionally, we investigated the effect of ATL treatment on tau pathology in 3xTg-AD mice. We found that LXA4 levels are reduced with age, a pattern significantly more impacted in 3xTg-AD mice. Moreover, ATL delivery enhanced the cognitive performance of 3xTg-AD mice and reduced Abeta levels, as well as decreased the levels of phosphorylated-tau (p-tau). The decrease in p-tau was due in part to an inhibition of the tau kinases GSK-3beta and p38 MAPK. In addition, microglial and astrocyte reactivity was inhibited by ATL treatment. Our results suggest that the inability to resolve the immune response during aging might be an important feature that contributes to AD pathology and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that activation of LXA4 signaling could serve as a potential therapeutic target for AD-related inflammation and cognitive dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Though it is widely accepted that amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a key factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. In order to study the association between Abeta and neural circuitry dysfunction, we developed a primary culture preparation derived from the nervous system of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster larvae expressing human Abeta1-42 (Abeta42). Cultured neurons undergo a consistent developmental process, culminating in an elaborate neuronal network with distinct functional and morphological characteristics. Throughout this development, a time-dependent increase in intracellular expression levels of Abeta42 was detected, followed by extracellular staining at a later time point. When compared to controls, Abeta42 cultures exhibited enhanced levels of apoptosis, resulting in reduced cell viability. Moreover, as primary culture preparations enable high resolution monitoring of neuronal phenotypes, we were able to detect subtle morphological changes in neurons expressing Abeta42, namely an enhancement in neurite outgrowth and arborization, which preceded the effect of neurodegeneration. Our results establish D. melanogaster primary neuronal cultures as a rapid, accessible and cost-effective platform for AD molecular studies and drug screening, and suggest a possible role for Abeta42 in the organization of neuronal processes.",

    "title": "Cannabis-based medicine reduces multiple pathological processes in AbetaPP/PS1 mice.",
    "abstract": "Several recent findings suggest that targeting the endogenous cannabinoid system can be considered as a potential therapeutic approach to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study supports this hypothesis demonstrating that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD) botanical extracts, as well as the combination of both natural cannabinoids, which are the components of an already approved cannabis-based medicine, preserved memory in AbetaPP/PS1 transgenic mice when chronically administered during the early symptomatic stage. Moreover, THC + CBD reduced learning impairment in AbetaPP/PS1 mice. A significant decrease in soluble Abeta42 peptide levels and a change in plaques composition were also observed in THC + CBD-treated AbetaPP/PS1 mice, suggesting a cannabinoid-induced reduction in the harmful effect of the most toxic form of the Abeta peptide. Among the mechanisms related with these positive cognitive effects, the anti-inflammatory properties of cannabinoids may also play a relevant role. Here we observed reduced astrogliosis, microgliosis, and inflammatory-related molecules in treated AbetaPP/PS1 mice, which were more marked after treatment with THC + CBD than with either THC or CBD. Moreover, other cannabinoid-induced effects were uncovered by a genome-wide gene expression study. Thus, we have identified the redox protein thioredoxin 2 and the signaling protein Wnt16 as significant substrates for the THC + CBD-induced effects in our AD model. In summary, the present findings show that the combination of THC and CBD exhibits a better therapeutic profile than each cannabis component alone and support the consideration of a cannabis-based medicine as potential therapy against AD.",

Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposition in the brain is one of its hallmarks, and the measure of plasma Abeta is considered to be a biomarker for anti-amyloid drug efficacy in animal models of AD. However, age-associated plasmatic Abeta modulation in animal models is practically never addressed in the literature. Mouse lemur primates are used as a model of normal and AD-like cerebral aging. Here, we studied the effect of age on plasmatic Abeta in 58 mouse lemurs aged from 1 to 10 years. A subset of animals presented high plasmatic Abeta, and the proportion of animals with high plasmatic Abeta was higher in aged animals as compared with young ones. Histologic evaluation of the brain of some of these animals was carried out to assess extracellular and intracellular amyloid load. In aged lemurs, plasmatic Abeta was negatively correlated with the density of neurons accumulating deposits of Abeta.",

The present study examined ethnic comparability of the plasma pharmacokinetics, which is the input to the brain, between Caucasian and Japanese subjects. METHODS: Two identical phase I trials were performed in 18 German and 18 Japanese healthy volunteers to evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 300 MBq (18)F-florbetaben, either of low (<=5 mug, LD) or high (50-55 mug, HD) mass dose. Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated based on the total (18)F radioactivity measurements in plasma followed by metabolite analysis using radio-HPLC. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of (18)F-florbetaben was characterized by a rapid elimination from plasma. The dose-normalized areas under the curve of (18)F-florbetaben in plasma as an indicator of the input to the brain were comparable between Germans (LD: 0.38 min/l, HD: 0.55 min/l) and Japanese (LD: 0.35 min/l, HD: 0.45 min/l) suggesting ethnic similarity, and the mass dose effect was minimal. A polar metabolite fraction was the main radiolabelled degradation product in plasma and was also similar between the doses and the ethnic groups. CONCLUSION: Absence of a difference in the pharmacokinetics of (18)F-florbetaben in Germans and Japanese has warranted further global development of the PET imaging agent.",

Correspondingly, cystic epithelia express higher levels of integrins (ECM receptors that control various cellular responses, such as cell proliferation, migration, and survival) that are characteristically altered in cystic cells. To determine whether the altered expression of ECM and integrins could establish a pathologic autostimulatory loop, we tested the role of integrin-beta1 in vitro and on the cystic development of ADPKD in vivo. Compared with wild-type cells, PC1-depleted immortalized renal collecting duct cells had higher levels of integrin-beta1 and fibronectin and displayed increased integrin-mediated signaling in the presence of Mn(2+). In mice, conditional inactivation of integrin-beta1 in collecting ducts resulted in a dramatic inhibition of Pkd1-dependent cystogenesis with a concomitant suppression of fibrosis and preservation of normal renal function. Our data provide genetic evidence that a functional integrin-beta1 is required for the early events leading to renal cystogenesis in ADPKD and suggest that the integrin signaling pathway may be an effective therapeutic target for slowing disease progression.",

    "title": "Identifying cost-effective predictive rules of amyloid-beta level by integrating neuropsychological tests and plasma-based markers.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Detecting participants who are positive for amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology is germane in designing prevention trials by enriching for those cases that are more likely to be amyloid positive. Existing brain amyloid measurement techniques, such as the Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid, are not reasonable first-line approaches limited by either feasibility or cost. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify simple and cost-effective rules that can predict brain Abeta level by integrating both neuropsychological measurements and blood-based markers. METHOD: Several decision tree models were built for extracting the predictive rules based on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. RESULTS: We successfully extracted predictive rules of Abeta level. For cognitive function variables, cases above the 45th percentile in total cognitive score (TOTALMOD), above the 52nd percentile of delayed word recall, and above the 70th percentile in orientation resulted in a group that was highly enriched for amyloid negative cases. Conversely scoring below the 15th percentile of TOTALMOD resulted in a group highly enriched for amyloid positive cases. For blood protein markers, scoring below the 57th percentile for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) levels (irrespective of genotype) enriched two fold for the risk of being amyloid positive. In the high ApoE cases, scoring above the 60th percentile for transthyretin resulted in a group that was >90% amyloid negative. A third decision tree using both cognitive and blood-marker data slightly improved the classification of cases. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the integration of the neuropsychological measurements and blood-based markers significantly improved prediction accuracy. The prediction model has led to several simple rules, which have a great potential of being naturally translated into clinical settings such as enrichment screening for AD prevention trials of anti-amyloid treatments.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, we have assessed the biophysical properties of lipid rafts from different brain areas in subjects exhibiting early neuropathological stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). By means of steady-state fluorescence polarization analyses using two environment-sensitive fluorescent probes, we demonstrate that lipid rafts from cerebellum, and frontal and entorhinal cortices, exhibit different biophysical behaviors depending on the stage of the disease. Thus, while membrane anisotropies were similar in the cerebellum along stages, lipid rafts from frontal and entorhinal cortices at AD stages I/II and AD III were significantly more liquid-ordered than in control subjects, both at the aqueous interface and hydrophobic core of the raft membrane. Thermotropic analyses demonstrated the presence of Arrhenius breakpoints between 28.3-32.0  C, which were not influenced by the disease stage. However, analyses of membrane microviscosity (etaapp) demonstrate that frontal and entorhinal lipid rafts are notably more viscous and liquid-ordered all across the membrane from early stages of the disease. These physicochemical alterations in lipid rafts do not correlate with changes in cholesterol or sphingomyelin levels, but to reduced unsaturation index and increased saturate/polyunsaturated ratios in phospholipid acyl chains. Moreover, we demonstrate that beta-secretase/AbetaPP (amyloid-beta protein precursor) interaction and lipid raft microviscosity are strongly, and positively, correlated in AD frontal and entorhinal cortices. These observations strengthens the hypothesis that physical properties of these microdomains modulate the convergence of amyloidogenic machinery toward lipid rafts, and also points to a critical role of polyunsaturated fatty acids in amyloidogenic processing of AbetaPP.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and is generated by beta- and gamma-secretase-mediated proteolytic processing of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP). In the present study, we investigated the effect of 118 natural compounds on Abeta production in the medium of HEK293 cells stably expressing human AbetaPP695 (HEK293-AbetaPP) using Abeta42 sandwich ELISA to find natural compounds that can modulate Abeta production. We found that a coumarin derivative of citrus fruits, auraptene, increased Abeta production. Treatment of HEK293-AbetaPP cells and rat primary cortical neurons with auraptene significantly increased the secretion of Abeta40, Abeta42, and the Abeta42/40 ratio. However, auraptene did not change the protein levels of the AbetaPP processing enzymes, a disintegrin and metalloproteinases 10 (ADAM10, alpha-secretase), beta-site AbetaPP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1, beta-secretase), and presenilin 1 (PS1, gamma-secretase component). Auraptene increased the activity of gamma-secretase but not that of alpha- and beta-secretase. Furthermore, auraptene enhanced gamma-secretase-mediated production of Abeta from AbetaPP or AbetaPP-C99, but not through alpha- and beta-secretase. Auraptene also phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and pretreatment with the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, reduced auraptene-induced gamma-secretase activity. Overall, our results suggest that auraptene-mediated activation of JNK may contribute to the production of Abeta by promoting gamma-secretase activity.",

Although full-length APP has been thoroughly studied, the role of the cleavage fragments especially the N-terminal fragments (N-APPs) in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis was still elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that application of recombinant APP18-286 could enhance beta amyloid (Abeta)-induced neuronal injuries which were related to the activation of apoptosis proteins. Abeta treatment could induce a slight increase of N-APPs release. In addition, expression of death receptor 6 (DR6) was increased in Abeta-treated neurons and APP transgenic mice. Moreover, the effect of APP18-286 on Abeta-induced injuries could be suppressed by the application of recombinant DR641-341 and DR6 antibody. Furthermore, pull-down assay revealed that APP18-286 could bind both exogenous and endogenous DR6. Abeta promoted APP18-286 targeting to neuron which was accompanied with the increase of DR6 expression, whereas downregulation of DR6 by interference RNA could alleviate the binding of N-APPs to neuron and also suppressed Abeta-dependent toxic effect with N-APPs. These results suggested that APP N-terminal fragments might play neurotoxic roles in Abeta-induced neuronal injuries through cell surface DR6.",

METHODS: We selected 284 subjects with AD pathology, defined as abnormal levels of amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Disease outcome measures included six biomarkers and five cognitive markers. We compared differences in baseline measures and decline over 4 years between the AD stages and tested whether these changes differed from subjects, without AD pathology (N = 132). RESULTS: CSF Abeta1-42 reached the maximum abnormality level in the asymptomatic stage and tau in the MCI stage. The imaging and cognitive markers started to decline in the asymptomatic stage, and decline accelerated with advancing clinical stage. CONCLUSION: This study provides further evidence for a temporal evolution of AD biomarkers. Our findings may be helpful to determine stage specific outcome measures for clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies commonly include too few of the oldest old to provide accurate prevalence rates of dementia in older age groups. Estimates of the number of those affected, necessary for healthcare planning, are thus flawed. The objective is to estimate the prevalence of dementia and levels of dementia severity in a very large population of oldest old and to investigate the relation between age and dementia prevalence in the extreme ages. METHODS: The Monzino 80-plus is a population-based study among residents 80 years or older in Varese province, Italy. Dementia cases were identified using a one-phase design. The survey was conducted in the participant's place of residence, whether home or institution. Both participants and informants were interviewed. Information was available for 2504 of the 2813 residents (89%). RESULTS: In all, 894 individuals (714 women and 180 men) met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition) criteria for dementia, for a standardized prevalence of 25.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.4, 27.2%), 28.5% (95% CI: 26.2, 30.9) in women and 18.6% (95% CI: 15.2, 21.9) in men. Age-specific prevalence estimates of dementia increased with age from 15.7% at age 80 to 84 years to 65.9% at age 100 years and higher. For women, prevalence continued to rise after age 100 years, from 64.8% at age 100 to 101 years to 76.1% at age 102 to 107 years. After age 85 years prevalence rates tended to rise linearly, on average 2.6% per year in women and 1.8% in men. About 80% of the cases were moderate or severe. The frequency of mild dementia decreased and that of severe dementia increased with age. CONCLUSION: One-quarter of 80-plus year olds are affected by dementia, mostly moderate or severe. Prevalence rates of dementia do not level off, but continue to rise gradually even in the extreme ages.",

We assessed the change of diagnosis, diagnostic confidence, and impact on patient management. RESULTS: A total of 438 patients (age 63 +- 8 years, 39% women) were included, of whom 351 (80%) underwent lumbar puncture. After the disclosure of CSF 23/351 diagnoses (7%) were changed. Diagnostic confidence increased from 84% to 89% (P < .001). There were consequences for management in 44/351 patients (13%) with CSF, and 13/87 patients (15%) because of unavailable CSF. There was no effect of age on these results. CONCLUSIONS: CSF biomarkers aid clinicians with decision making during diagnostic work-up of cognitive disorders.

    "abstract": "To unlock the full potential of disease modifying treatments, it is essential to develop early biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). For practical reasons, blood-based markers that could provide a signal at the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or even earlier would be ideal. Using the proteomic approach of isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ), we compared the plasma protein profiles of MCI, AD, and cognitively normal control subjects from two independent cohorts: the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (261 MCI subjects, 24 AD subjects, 411 controls) and the Hunter Community Study (180 MCI subjects, 153 controls). The objective was to identify any proteins that are differentially abundant in MCI and AD plasma in both cohorts, since they might be of interest as potential biomarkers, or could help direct future mechanistic studies. Proteins representative of biological processes relevant to AD pathology, such as the complement system, the coagulation cascade, lipid metabolism, and metal and vitamin D and E transport, were found to differ in abundance in MCI. In particular, levels of complement regulators C1 inhibitor and factor H, fibronectin, ceruloplasmin, and vitamin D-binding protein were significantly decreased in MCI participants from both cohorts. Several apolipoproteins, including apolipoprotein AIV, B-100, and H were also significantly decreased in MCI. Most of these proteins have previously been reported as potential biomarkers for AD; however, we show for the first time that a significant decrease in plasma levels of two potential biomarkers (fibronectin and C1 inhibitor) is evident at the MCI stage.",

METHODS: We evaluated APOE-related differences in BOLD activation in response to a memory task, cerebrovascular reactivity using a CO2-inhalation challenge (CO2-CVR), and the potential contribution of CO2-CVR to the BOLD signal. RESULTS: APOE epsilon4-carriers had the highest task-related hippocampal BOLD signal relative to non-carriers. The largest differences in CO2-CVR were between epsilon2- and epsilon4-carriers, with the latter having the lowest values. Genotype differences in CO2-CVR accounted for ~70% of hippocampal BOLD differences between groups. CONCLUSION: Because CO2-CVR gauges vascular health, the differential effect of APOE in young adults may reflect a vascular contribution to the vulnerability of epsilon4-carriers to late-life pathology.

    "abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that polymorphisms in CASP8 on chromosome 2 are associated with breast cancer risk. To clarify the role of CASP8 in breast cancer susceptibility, we carried out dense genotyping of this region in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning a 1 Mb region around CASP8 were genotyped in 46 450 breast cancer cases and 42 600 controls of European origin from 41 studies participating in the BCAC as part of a custom genotyping array experiment (iCOGS). Missing genotypes and SNPs were imputed and, after quality exclusions, 501 typed and 1232 imputed SNPs were included in logistic regression models adjusting for study and ancestry principal components. The SNPs retained in the final model were investigated further in data from nine genome-wide association studies (GWAS) comprising in total 10 052 case and 12 575 control subjects. The most significant association signal observed in European subjects was for the imputed intronic SNP rs1830298 in ALS2CR12 (telomeric to CASP8), with per allele odds ratio and 95% confidence interval [OR (95% confidence interval, CI)] for the minor allele of 1.05 (1.03-1.07), P = 1 x 10(-5). Three additional independent signals from intronic SNPs were identified, in CASP8 (rs36043647), ALS2CR11 (rs59278883) and CFLAR (rs7558475). The association with rs1830298 was replicated in the imputed results from the combined GWAS (P = 3 x 10(-6)), yielding a combined OR (95% CI) of 1.06 (1.04-1.08), P = 1 x 10(-9).

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is hypothesized to be a major driving force behind Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. This hypothesis predicts that activated microglial cells can stimulate neurons to produce excessive amounts of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta1-42) and tau. The excess Abeta1-42 forms extracellular deposits which stimulate further microglial activation. The excess tau is partially released but also becomes phosphorylated forming intracellular neurofibrillary deposits. The end result is a positive feedback mechanism which drives the disease development. To test the viability of this hypothesis, we exposed differentiated SH-SY5Y and N-tera2/D1 (N-tera2) cells to conditioned medium (CM) from LPS/IFNgamma-stimulated human microglia. We found that the CM caused a large increase in the production and release of Abeta and tau. The CM also caused SH-SY5Y cells to increase their expression of amyloid precursor protein and release of its beta-secretase cleaved products (sAPPbetas) as well as Abeta oligomers, but the CM reduced release of its alpha-secretase cleaved products (sAPPalphas). Direct treatment of SH-SY5Y and N-tera2 cells with the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1beta as well as with Abeta1-42, resulted in an increase in tau messenger RNA and protein expression. Pretreatment of LPS/IFNgamma-stimulated human microglia cells with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen and aspirin, the antioxidant GSH, the H2S donor NaSH, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, resulted in a CM with diminished ability to stimulate tau expression. There was no effect on the morphology of SH-SY5Y cells, or on their viability, following exposure to micromolar levels of Abeta1-42. Our data indicate that reactive microglia play an important role in governing the expression of Abeta and tau, and therefore the progression of AD. They provide further evidence that appropriate anti-inflammatory treatment should be beneficial in AD.",

    "title": "Novel therapeutic strategy for neurodegeneration by blocking Abeta seeding mediated aggregation in models of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Abeta accumulation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies suggest that the process of Abeta nucleated polymerization is essential for Abeta fibril formation, pathology spreading and toxicity. Therefore, targeting this process represents an effective therapeutic strategy to slow or block disease progression. To discover compounds that might interfere with the Abeta seeding capacity, toxicity and pathology spreading, we screened a focused library of FDA-approved drugs in vitro using a seeding polymerization assay and identified small molecule inhibitors that specifically interfered with Abeta seeding-mediated fibril growth and toxicity. Mitoxantrone, bithionol and hexachlorophene were found to be the strongest inhibitors of fibril growth and protected primary cortical neuronal cultures against Abeta-induced toxicity. Next, we assessed the effects of these three inhibitors in vivo in the mThy1-APPtg mouse model of AD (8-month-old mice). We found that mitoxantrone and bithionol, but not hexachlorophene, stabilized diffuse amyloid plaques, reduced the levels of Abeta42 oligomers and ameliorated synapse loss, neuronal damage and astrogliosis. Together, our findings suggest that targeting fibril growth and Abeta seeding capacity constitutes a viable and effective strategy for protecting against neurodegeneration and disease progression in AD.",

The HEOR Fellowship Program at Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation was standardized to enhance the fellows' HEOR research understanding and align professional skill sets with the ACCP-ISPOR Fellowship Program Guidelines. Based on feedback from an internal task force comprised of HEOR employees and current and former fellows, the HEOR Fellowship Program was normatively and qualitatively assessed to evaluate the current curricular program. Fellowship program activities were instituted to ensure that the suggested minimum level requirements established by the guidelines were being met. Research opportunities enabling fellows to work hand-in-hand with other fellows and HEOR professionals were emphasized. Curricular enhancements in research methodology and professional training and development, and materials for a structured journal club focusing on specific methodological and HEOR research topics were developed. A seminar series (e.g., creating SMART Goals, StrengthsFinder 2.0) and professional courses (e.g., ISPOR short courses, statistics.com) were included to enhance the fellows' short- and long-term professional experience. Additional program attributes include an online reference library developed to enrich the current research facilities and a Statistical Analysis Software training program.

    "abstract": "Recent evidence supports the amyloid cascade hypothesis that a pathological change of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain is an initiating event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accordingly, modulating the abnormal Abeta aggregation is considered a potential therapeutic target in AD. Curcumin, a low-molecular-weight polyphenol derived from the well-known curry spice turmeric, has shown favorable effects on preventing or treating AD pathology. The present study investigated the effects of curcumin and 2 novel curcumin derivatives, FMeC1 and FMeC2, on AD pathology in APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice. Mice fed a chow diet that contained FMeC1 for 6 months showed a reduction in insoluble Abeta deposits and glial cell activity together with reduced cognitive deficits, compared to animals receiving a control diet or with curcumin or FMeC2 in their diet. Both curcumin and FMeC1 modulated the formation of Abeta aggregates; however, only FMeC1 significantly attenuated the cell toxicity of Abeta. These results indicate that FMeC1 may have potential for preventing AD.",

    "title": "The adipocyte differentiation protein APMAP is an endogenous suppressor of Abeta production in the brain.",
    "abstract": "The deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates in the brain is a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is generated from the cleavage of C-terminal fragments of the amyloid precursor protein (APP-CTFs) by gamma-secretase, an intramembrane-cleaving protease with multiple substrates, including the Notch receptors. Endogenous modulation of gamma-secretase is pointed to be implicated in the sporadic, age-dependent form of AD. Moreover, specifically modulating Abeta production has become a priority for the safe treatment of AD because the inhibition of gamma-secretase results in adverse effects that are related to impaired Notch cleavage. Here, we report the identification of the adipocyte differentiation protein APMAP as a novel endogenous suppressor of Abeta generation. We found that APMAP interacts physically with gamma-secretase and its substrate APP. In cells, the partial depletion of APMAP drastically increased the levels of APP-CTFs, as well as uniquely affecting their stability, with the consequence being increased secretion of Abeta. In wild-type and APP/ presenilin 1 transgenic mice, partial adeno-associated virus-mediated APMAP knockdown in the hippocampus increased Abeta production by ~20 and ~55%, respectively. Together, our data demonstrate that APMAP is a negative regulator of Abeta production through its interaction with APP and gamma-secretase. All observed APMAP phenotypes can be explained by an impaired degradation of APP-CTFs, likely caused by an altered substrate transport capacity to the lysosomal/autophagic system.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The emergence of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum in Southeast Asia threatens malaria treatment efficacy. Mutations in a kelch protein encoded on P. falciparum chromosome 13 (K13) have been associated with resistance in vitro and in field samples from Cambodia. METHODS: P. falciparum infections from artesunate efficacy trials in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam were genotyped at 33 716 genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Linear mixed models were used to test associations between parasite genotypes and parasite clearance half-lives following artesunate treatment. K13 mutations were tested for association with artemisinin resistance, and extended haplotypes on chromosome 13 were examined to determine whether mutations arose focally and spread or whether they emerged independently. RESULTS: The presence of nonreference K13 alleles was associated with prolonged parasite clearance half-life (P = 1.97 x 10(-12)). Parasites with a mutation in any of the K13 kelch domains displayed longer parasite clearance half-lives than parasites with wild-type alleles. Haplotype analysis revealed both population-specific emergence of mutations and independent emergence of the same mutation in different geographic areas. CONCLUSIONS: K13 appears to be a major determinant of artemisinin resistance throughout Southeast Asia. While we found some evidence of spreading resistance, there was no evidence of resistance moving westward from Cambodia into Myanmar.",

    "abstract": "Oligomeric forms of amyloid-beta (Abeta) are thought to be responsible for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. While many oligomers of Abeta are thought to be naturally occurring in the brain of humans and/or transgenic animals, it is well known that Abeta oligomers are also readily produced in vitro in the laboratory. In recent studies, we discovered that synthetic monomeric Abeta (4.7 kDa) could be transformed by microdialysis to higher molecular weight species (approximately 56 kDa, by western blot). Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and electron microscopy further identified these species' as potential Abeta oligomers. The production of similar species could also be produced by centrifugal filtration and this formation was concentration and pore-size dependent. These higher order species of Abeta were resistant to dissolution in NaOH, HFIP, formic acid, urea, and guanidine. We postulate that we have identified a novel way of producing a high order species of oligomeric Abeta and we provide evidence to suggest that Abeta oligomers can quite easily be a product of normal laboratory practices. These data suggest that the experimental detection of higher order oligomers in tissues derived from Alzheimer's disease brains or from animal models of disease could, in some cases, be a product the method of analysis.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is currently believed that therapeutic interventions will be most effective when introduced at the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This underlines the importance of biomarkers to detect AD pathology in vivo before clinical disease onset. OBJECTIVE: To examine the evolution of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker and brain structure changes in the preclinical phase of familial AD. METHODS: The study included members from four Swedish families at risk for carrying an APPswe, APParc, PSEN1 H163Y, or PSEN1 I143T mutation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained from 13 mutation carriers (MC) and 20 non-carriers (NC) and analyzed using vertex-based analyses of cortical thickness and volume. CSF was collected from 10 MC and 12 NC from familial AD families and analyzed for Abeta42, total tau (T-tau) and phospho-tau (P-tau). RESULTS: The MC had significantly lower levels of CSF Abeta42 and higher levels T-tau and P-tau than the NC. There was a trend for a decrease in Abeta42 15-20 years before expected onset of clinical symptoms, while increasing T-tau and P-tau was not found until close to the expected clinical onset. The MC had decreased volume on MRI in the left precuneus, superior temporal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant biomarker levels in CSF as well as regional brain atrophy are present in preclinical familial AD, several years before the expected onset of clinical symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation, neuroinflammation, basal forebrain cholinergic loss and hippocampal degeneration are well-described pathologies associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role that age plays in the susceptibility of the brain to these AD pathologies and the relationships between them is still not well understood. This study investigated the age-related response to intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta(25-35) in 3-, 6- and 9-month-old rats. Abeta toxicity resulted in an age-related increase in cholinergic loss and microglial activation in the basal forebrain along with neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA3 subfield. Performance in the Morris water maze revealed impairments in long-term reference memory in 6-month-old Abeta administered animals, which was not seen in 3-month-old animals. These results support a role of Abeta administration in inducing age-dependent cholinergic loss and neuroinflammation, and additionally provide evidence for a more age-appropriate model of adult-onset Abeta toxicity demonstrating pathological changes that reflect the early stages of AD pathogenesis including neuroinflammation, cholinergic loss and beginning stages of memory impairment.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid protein depositions play crucial roles in a variety of degenerative disorders composing amyloidosis. There is a great interest in developing small molecule inhibitors of amyloidogenic processes. We examined the inhibitory effects of echinacoside (ECH) with different concentrations and at different fiber-forming stages in vitro utilizing the hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) model system. We also evaluated the antioxidant capacity of ECH by using elimination tests for the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl (HO) free radicals. We investigated the protection provided by ECH against neurotoxicity induced by beta-amyloid protein (Abeta). Through spectroscopic analyses, electron microscopy, cell viability assay, and hemolysis assay, we found that ECH dose dependently inhibited HEWL aggregation, and this inhibition occurred in different fiber-forming stages. ECH could also scavenge the DPPH and OH free radicals in a concentration-dependent manner. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluoresceindiacetate (DCFH-DA) fluorescent measurement results indicated that ECH could increase viability of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells injured by Abeta and suppress the increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggered by Abeta. The present study findings facilitate a better understanding of the interaction between ECH and amyloid-forming proteins and also shed light on the protection of ECH against amyloid fibril-induced neuronal cell death.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, inevitably develop characteristic Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, including neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Amyloid-beta protein, the major component of neuritic plaques, is the proteolytic product of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP). APP and the regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) genes on chromosome 21 play a pivotal role in promoting plaque formation and neuronal apoptosis. However, the mechanism underlying AD pathogenesis in DS is not well defined. In this study, we demonstrated that APP significantly increased RCAN1 level in both cells and transgenic mice. Overexpression of APP significantly reduced the expression of 2 proteasome subunits, proteasome subunit alpha type-5 and proteasome subunit beta type-7, leading to the inhibition of proteasomal degradation of RCAN1. Furthermore, knockdown of RCAN1 expression attenuated APP-induced neuronal apoptosis. Taken together, the results clearly showed that APP has a previously unknown function in regulating RCAN1-mediated neuronal apoptosis through the proteasome pathway. Our study demonstrates a novel mechanism by which overexpression of APP and RCAN1 causes neurodegeneration and AD pathogenesis in DS, and it provides new insights into the potential of targeting APP-induced proteasomal impairment and RCAN1 accumulation for AD and DS treatment.",

    "title": "Is radical nephrectomy a legitimate therapeutic option in patients with renal masses amenable to nephron-sparing surgery?",
    "abstract": "The decision to perform a radical nephrectomy (RN) or a partial nephrectomy (PN), not unlike most decisions in clinical practice, ultimately hinges on the balance of risk. Do the higher risks of a more complex surgery (PN) justify the theoretical benefits of kidney tissue preservation? Data suggest that for patients with an anatomically complex renal mass and a normal contralateral kidney, for whom additional surgical intensity may be risky, such as the elderly and comorbid, RN presents a robust treatment option. Nevertheless, PN, especially for small and anatomically simple renal masses in young patients without comorbidities should remain the surgical reference standard, as preservation of renal tissue can serve as an 'insurance policy' not only against future renal functional decline, but also against the possibility of tumour development in the contralateral kidney. In the present review, we outline the ongoing debate between the role of RN and PN in treatment of the enhancing renal mass.",

    "title": "Physician-reported barriers to referring cancer patients to specialists: prevalence, factors, and association with career satisfaction.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Quality care for patients with cancer often requires access to specialty providers, but little is known about barriers to referring cancer patients for specialized care. Referral barriers may also lessen physician career satisfaction. The study was aimed at determining what factors are associated with these barriers and whether greater barriers are associated with low career satisfaction. METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined 1562 primary care physicians (PCPs) and 2144 specialists responding to the multiregional Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium physician survey. The prevalence of physician-reported barriers to referring cancer patients for more specialized care (restricted provider networks, preauthorization requirements, patient inability to pay, lack of surgical subspecialists, and excessive patient travel time) was assessed. The 5 items were averaged to calculate a barrier score. A multivariate linear regression was used to determine physician and practice setting characteristics associated with the barrier score, and a multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the association of the barrier score with physician career satisfaction. RESULTS: Three in 5 physicians reported always, usually, or sometimes encountering any barrier to cancer patient specialty referrals. In adjusted analyses of PCPs and specialists, international medical graduates, physicians practicing in solo or government-owned practices, and physicians with <90% of their patients in managed care plans had higher barrier scores than others (P < .05). High barrier scores were associated with lower physician career satisfaction among PCPs and specialists (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Many physicians experience barriers to specialty referral for cancer patients. Uniform systems for providing and tracking timely referrals may enhance care and promote physician career satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a new methodology to facilitate prediction of recurrent prostate cancer (CaP) following radical prostatectomy (RP) via the integration of quantitative image features and protein expression in the excised prostate. Creating a fused predictor from high-dimensional data streams is challenging because the classifier must 1) account for the \"curse of dimensionality\" problem, which hinders classifier performance when the number of features exceeds the number of patient studies and 2) balance potential mismatches in the number of features across different channels to avoid classifier bias towards channels with more features. Our new data integration methodology, supervised Multi-view Canonical Correlation Analysis (sMVCCA), aims to integrate infinite views of highdimensional data to provide more amenable data representations for disease classification. Additionally, we demonstrate sMVCCA using Spearman's rank correlation which, unlike Pearson's correlation, can account for nonlinear correlations and outliers. Forty CaP patients with pathological Gleason scores 6-8 were considered for this study. 21 of these men revealed biochemical recurrence (BCR) following RP, while 19 did not. For each patient, 189 quantitative histomorphometric attributes and 650 protein expression levels were extracted from the primary tumor nodule. The fused histomorphometric/proteomic representation via sMVCCA combined with a random forest classifier predicted BCR with a mean AUC of 0.74 and a maximum AUC of 0.9286. We found sMVCCA to perform statistically significantly (p < 0.05) better than comparative state-of-the-art data fusion strategies for predicting BCR. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated improved BCR-free survival prediction for the sMVCCA-fused classifier as compared to histology or proteomic features alone.",

    "title": "Induction of GADD34 Regulates the Neurotoxicity of Amyloid beta.",
    "abstract": "The possible roles played by growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 34 (GADD34) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are so far less understood. In this study, we found that GADD34 was increased in the brains of AD transgenic J20 mice. The deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide is the main component of neurotic plaques in AD brain. Thus, we examined the effect of Abeta in the expression of GADD34 in human SH-SY5Y cells in vitro. Amyloid beta (Abeta1-42) treatment led to increased expression of GADD34. Pretreatment with 50 nmol/L of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) inhibitor SP600125 abolished the upregulation of GADD34. c-Jun silencing by transfection with c-Jun small-interfering RNA abolished the effects of Abeta1-42 on the expression of GADD34. Importantly, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies verified the ability of c-Jun to bind to the GADD34 promoter, and this ability was increased more than 3-fold by Abeta1-42. These data suggest that the induction of GADD34 by Abeta is mediated by JNK/c-Jun pathway. Finally, depletion of GADD34 significantly rescued Abeta-induced cell apoptosis as evidenced by a marked decrease in the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells. Consistently, knockdown of GADD34 attenuated caspase 3 activation induced by Abeta1-42.",

    "abstract": "The neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease include extracellular neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The neuritic plaques contain beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta peptides) as the major proteinaceous constituent and are surrounded by activated microglia and astrocytes as well as dystrophic neurites. N-terminally truncated forms of Abeta peptides are highly prevalent in neuritic plaques, including Abeta 3-x beginning at Glu eventually modified to pyroglutamate (Abeta N3pE-x), Abeta 2-x, Abeta 4-x, and Abeta 5-x. The precise origin of the different N-terminally modified Abeta peptides currently remains unknown. To assess the contribution of specific cell types to the formation of different N-terminally truncated Abeta peptides, supernatants from serum-free primary cell cultures of chicken neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, as well as human astrocytes, were analyzed by Abeta-ELISA and one- and two-dimensional SDS-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot analysis. To evaluate the contribution of beta- and gamma-secretase to the generation of N-terminally modified Abeta, cultured astrocytes were treated with membrane-anchored \"tripartite beta-secretase (BACE1) inhibitors\" and the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT. Neurons, astrocytes, and microglia each exhibited cell type-specific patterns of secreted Abeta peptides. Neurons predominantly secreted Abeta peptides that begin at Asp1, whereas those released from astrocytes and microglia included high proportions of N-terminally modified Abeta peptides, presumably including Abeta 2/3-x and 4/5-x. The inhibition of BACE1 reduced the amount of Abeta 1-x in cell culture supernatants but not the amount of Abeta 2-x.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prostate and thyroid cancers represent two of the most overdiagnosed tumors in the US. Hypothesizing that patients diagnosed with one of these malignancies were more likely to be diagnosed with the other, we examined the coupling of diagnoses of prostate and thyroid cancer in a large US administrative dataset. METHODS: The surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database was used to identify men diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer (CaP) or thyroid cancer between 1995 and 2010. SEER*stat software was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and investigate the rates of subsequent malignancy diagnosis. Additional non-urologic cancer sites were added as control groups. RESULTS: Patients with thyroid cancer were much more likely to be diagnosed with CaP than patients in the SEER control group (SIR 1.28 [95% CI 1.1-1.5]; p < 0.05). Similarly, the observed incidence of thyroid cancer was significantly higher in patients with CaP when compared with SEER controls (SIR 1.30 [95% CI 1.2-1.4]; p < 0.05). When stratified by follow-up interval, the observed thyroid cancer diagnosis rate among men with CaP was significantly higher than expected at 2-11 (SIR 1.83 [95% CI 1.4-2.4]), 12-59 (SIR 1.24 [95% CI 1.0-1.5]), and 60-119 (SIR 1.25 [95% CI 1.0-1.5]) months of follow-up. There was no increased risk of CaP or thyroid cancer diagnosis among patients with non-urologic malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant association of diagnoses with prostate and thyroid cancer in the US. In the absence of a known biological link between these tumors, these data suggest that diagnosis patterns for prostate and thyroid malignancies are linked.",

Further in vitro COX-1/COX-2 evaluations revealed that 4-methoxy derivative 3 had a high selective COX-1 inhibitory activity (COX-1, IC50=0.12 mum, SI>833). To evaluate their potential use against Alzheimer's disease, in vitro evaluation of beta-amyloid fibril formation using Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) peptides was performed. The evaluation of their antiaggregation ability gave impressive results and comparable to rifampicin and indomethacin. Conformational study of compound 3 and subsequent docking of its restrained analogs on both active sites of COX-1 and COX-2 could provide a proof of its COX-1 selectivity as well as molecular dynamic simulation could elucidate and give more insight into the amyloid disaggregation mechanisms leading to rational design of inhibitors.",

    "title": "Effects of multifunctional antioxidants on mitochondrial dysfunction and amyloid-beta metal dyshomeostasis.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Redox-active metal dyshomeostasis and oxidative stress are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and amyloid-beta (Abeta) neurotoxicity that are linked to both the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). As potential therapeutic agents, orally active multifunctional antioxidants (MFAOs) possessing two independent functional groups capable of binding redox-active metals and scavenging free radicals have been synthesized. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether MFAOs affect mitochondrial function and reduce the presence of Abeta plaque formation. METHODS: The MFAOs were evaluated in cultured SH-SY5Y cells and ARPE-19 cells. MFAO effects on mitochondrial function were investigated using rhodamine 123 staining after 2 hour exposure to MnCl2. MFAO effects on Abeta:Zn complex formation were evaluated with Zinquin staining and the ability of the Abeta:Zn complex to be degraded by matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). The ability of MFAOs to reduce Abeta plaque in the brain was determined by orally feeding MFAO for one year to B6;129-Psen1tm1Mpm Tg(AbetaPPSwe,tauP301L) 1Lfa/Mmjax transgenic mice. Abeta levels were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: MFAOs neither adversely affected mitochondrial signaling nor labile cytoplasmic zinc levels. MFAOs protected cells against Mn2+-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. MFAOs also removed zinc from the Abeta:Zn complex so that Abeta plaque could be degraded by MMP-2. Zinquin staining indicated that the removed zinc was present in the cytoplasm as labile zinc. Orally administered MFAOs reduced the brain levels of both Abeta40 and Abeta42 isoforms of Abeta. CONCLUSION: These studies demonstrate that these MFAOs have metal attenuating properties with therapeutic potential in the treatment of both AMD and AD.",

    "abstract": "Presently, migraine and dry eye are both thought to have an inflammatory pathogenesis. We aimed to investigate dry eye findings and any relationship with headache characteristics in migraine patients with and without aura. In total, 58 migraineurs and 41 age- and gender-matched controls were enrolled in this prospective clinical study. The migraine diagnosis was made according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders II diagnostic criteria. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination including tear meniscus measurements, meibography, tear breakup time, Schirmer test and the Ocular Surface Disease Index questionnaire. The presence of dry eye was higher in migraineurs as compared to the control group, but this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.282). Among the headache characteristics, the presence of aura was significantly higher, and disease and attack durations were significantly longer in migraineurs with dry eye than in those without dry eye (p = 0.009, p = 0.010, and p = 0.003, respectively). In multiple logistic regression model, attack duration was found to be independently associated with the presence of dry eye in migraine patients (OR; 95 % CI; p = 0.029). The results show that dry eye may present in migraine patients with greater presence of auras and longer disease and attack durations.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive reserve (CR) is a protective factor that supports cognition by increasing the resilience of an individual's cognitive function to the deleterious effects of cerebral lesions. A single environmental proxy indicator is often used to estimate CR (e.g. education), possibly resulting in a loss of the accuracy and predictive power of the investigation. Furthermore, while estimates of an individual's prior CR can be made, no operational measure exists to estimate dynamic change in CR resulting from exposure to new life experiences. METHODS: We aimed to develop two latent measures of CR through factor analysis: prior and current, in a sample of 467 healthy older adults. RESULTS: The prior CR measure combined proxy measures traditionally associated with CR, while the current CR measure combined variables that had the potential to reflect dynamic change in CR due to new life experiences. Our main finding was that the analyses uncovered latent variables in hypothesized prior and current models of CR. CONCLUSIONS: The prior CR model supports multivariate estimation of pre-existing CR and may be applied to more accurately estimate CR in the absence of neuropathological data. The current CR model may be applied to evaluate and explore the potential benefits of CR-based interventions prior to dementia onset.",

    "abstract": "(11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer designed to bind to amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The potential of PiB as an early marker of AD led to the increasing use of PiB in clinical research studies and development of several F-18-labeled Abeta radiotracers. Automatic quantification of PiB images requires an accurate parcellation of the brain's gray matter (GM). Typically, this relies on a coregistered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to extract the cerebellar GM, compute the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), and provide parcellation and segmentation for quantification of regional and global SUVR. However, not all subjects can undergo MRI, in which case, an MR-less method is desirable. In this study, we assess 3 PET-only quantification methods: a mean atlas, an adaptive atlas, and a multi-atlas approaches on a database of 237 subjects having been imaged with both PiB PET and MRI. The PET-only methods were compared against MR-based SUVR quantification and evaluated in terms of correlation, average error, and performance in classifying subjects with low and high Abeta deposition. The mean atlas method suffered from a significant bias between the estimated neocortical SUVR and the PiB status, resulting in an overall error of 5.6% (R(2) = 0.98), compared with the adaptive and multi-atlas approaches that had errors of 3.06% and 2.74%, respectively (R(2) = 0.98), and no significant bias. In classifying PiB-negative from PiB-positive subjects, the mean atlas had 10 misclassified subjects compared with 0 for the adaptive and 1 for the multi-atlas approach. Overall, the adaptive and the multi-atlas approaches performed similarly well against the MR-based quantification and would be a suitable replacements for PiB quantification when no MRI is available.",

    "title": "Towards a unified vision of copper involvement in Alzheimer's disease: a review connecting basic, experimental, and clinical research.",
    "abstract": "Copper is an essential micronutrient for physiological cell functioning and central nervous system (CNS) development. Indeed, it is a cofactor of many proteins and enzymes in a number of molecular pathways, including energy generation, oxygen transportation, hematopoiesis, cellular growth and metabolism, and signal transduction. This is because it serves as a catalyst of reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions in these processes. When copper is kept under control, bound to special proteins, it yields key properties. However, when it spirals out of control, it is exchanged among small compounds (it is loosely bound to them), and its redox activity makes it dangerous for cell viability, promoting oxidative stress. Copper homeostasis in the CNS is securely synchronized, and perturbations in brain copper levels are known to underlie the pathoetiology of wide spectrum of common neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. The main objective of this review is to provide some of the most relevant evidence gleaned from recent studies conducted on animal models and humans, and to discuss the evidence as it pertains to a new concept: Aberrant copper metabolism, which appears to have a genetic basis, is a modifiable risk factor accelerating Alzheimer's disease and initiation/progression of cognitive deficits in a percentage of susceptible persons.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidences suggest that nicotine exerts a neuroprotective effect on Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the precise mechanism is not fully elucidated. Here, HT22 cells were exposed to amyloid beta protein fragment (Abeta)1-42 to mimic the pathological process of neuron in AD. We hypothesized that cannabinoid receptor CB1 is involved in the nicotine-induced neuroprotection against Abeta1-42 injury in HT22 cells. CB1 expression in HT22 cells was investigated by immunocytochemistry and Western blot. The injury of HT22 cells was evaluated by cellular morphology, cell viability, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. The apoptosis of HT22 cells was assessed by flow cytometry and expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax. The results demonstrated that nicotine markedly upregulated CB1 expression, increased cell viability, ameliorated cellular morphology, decreased LDH release, and reduced the apoptotic rate of HT22 cells exposed to Abeta1-42 for 24 h, while the blockade of CB1 or the inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) partially reversed the neuroprotection. Furthermore, the blockade of CB1 reversed nicotine-induced PKC activation in HT22 cells exposed to Abeta1-42. These results suggest that CB1 is involved in the nicotine-induced neuroprotection against Abeta1-42 neurotoxicity, and the neuroprotection may be dependent on the activation of PKC.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine the additional value of bone marrow biopsy (BMB) in the standard staging work-up of patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), in terms of risk assessment and treatment planning. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 113 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL who had undergone standard pretreatment evaluation, including serum lactate dehydrogenase measurement, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status assessment, computed tomography or (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography, and BMB, were retrospectively included. National Comprehensive Cancer Network International Prognostic Index (NCCN-IPI) score and treatment strategy were determined in each patient, once without and once with taking into account BMB results. Numbers and percentages of BMB-induced changes on NCCN-IPI-based risk stratification (i.e. formation of low, low-intermediate, high-intermediate, and high risk groups) and choice of treatment were calculated, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: BMB was positive in 18 of 113 patients (15.9%, 95% CI 10.2-23.9 %). BMB-induced changes on NCCI-IPI-based risk stratification occurred in 9 of 113 patients (8.0%, 95% CI 4.1-14.6%). Five patients were upstaged from low-intermediate to high-intermediate risk, and four patients were upstaged from high-intermediate to high risk. BMB findings changed treatment planning in none of the 113 patients (0.0%, 95% CI 0.0-4.0%). CONCLUSION: Although BMB results upstaged the NCCN-IPI-based risk stratification in a small number of cases, this did not have any therapeutic implications in our patient series. These findings support the omission of BMB from routine staging of newly diagnosed DLBCL in the current risk stratification and treatment era.",

APMP-ApoE-liposomes were used to deliver NGF across a monolayer of human brain-microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) regulated by human astrocytes (HAs) for rescuing SK-N-MC cells from an insult of beta-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Abeta1-42). An increase in the APMP concentration enhanced the particle size, HBMEC and HA viability, permeability for propidium iodide (PI), and permeability for NGF, however, reduced the absolute value of zeta potential, APMP conjugation efficiency and transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). In addition, an increase in the ApoE concentration increased the particle size, absolute value of zeta potential, HBMEC and HA viability, permeability for PI, permeability for NGF and SK-N-MC cell viability, however, decreased the ApoE conjugation efficiency and TEER.

The resultant colloids were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and UV-visible spectra. The results indicated that the composite particles with core/shell structure and an average diameter of ~ 320 nm were stable and biocompatible. The RLS intensity of Fe3O4@Au composites was significantly enhanced by interacting with Abeta. Under optimal conditions, good linear relationship between the ratio of RLS intensity I/I0 at 463.0 nm and the logarithmic value of Abeta concentration in the range of 5.0 x 10(-15)-5.56 x 10(-9)M was found.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder most often diagnosed 10 years after its onset and development. It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (ABP) into amyloid plaques between nerve cells, which produces a massive local neurodegeneration. Molecular magnetic resonance imaging allows diagnosis of AD by showing ABP accumulation in the brain. The ultrasmall particles of iron oxide (USPIO) derivatives proposed in the present work were functionalized with peptides that present an affinity for ABP, independently of its state of aggregation. Their nanomolar Kd * confirms the high affinity of our vectorized contrast agents (VCA) for ABP and therefore their high labeling potential, specificity and sensitivity. Their lack of toxicity has been demonstrated, both by in vitro studies using the MTT method on several cell types, and by in vivo investigations with assessment of renal and hepatic biomarkers and by histopathology evaluation. The results of biodistribution studies corroborated by MRI demonstrate that USPIO-PHO (USPIO coupled to peptide C-IPLPFYN-C) are able to cross the blood-brain barrier without any facilitating strategy, and accumulates in the brain 90 min after its injection in NMRI mice. None of the USPIO derivatives were found in any organs one week after administration. To conclude, USPIO-PHO seems to have a genuine potential for labeling amyloid plaques in the brain; it has a nanomolar binding affinity, no toxic effects, and its elimination half-life is about 3 h. Further tests will be made on transgenic mice, aimed at confirming the potential of early AD diagnosis using our VCA.",

In the current investigation, the SATAQ-3 was revised to improve upon some conceptual limitations and was evaluated in 4 U.S. and 3 international female samples, as well as a U.S. male sample. In Study 1, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses for a sample of women from the Southeastern United States (N = 859) indicated a 22-item scale with 5 factors: Internalization: Thin/Low Body Fat, Internalization: Muscular/Athletic, Pressures: Family, Pressures: Media, Pressures: Peers. This scale structure was confirmed in 3 independent and geographically diverse samples of women from the United States (East Coast N = 440, West Coast N = 304, and North/Midwest N = 349). SATAQ-4 scale scores demonstrated excellent reliability and good convergent validity with measures of body image, eating disturbance, and self-esteem. Study 2 replicated the factorial validity, reliability, and convergent validity of the SATAQ-4 in an international sample of women drawn from Italy, England, and Australia (N = 362).

    "abstract": "In early Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, reduction of sigma-1 receptors (sigma1R) is detected. In this study, we employed male heterozygous sigma1R knockout (sigma1R(+/-)) mice showing normal cognitive performance to investigate association of sigma1R deficiency with AD risk. Herein we report that a single injection (i.c.v.) of Abeta(25-35) impaired spatial memory with approximately 25% death of pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 region of WT mice (Abeta(25-35)-WT mice), whereas it did not cause such impairments in sigma1R(+/-) mice (Abeta(25-35)-sigma1R(+/-) mice). Compared with WT mice, Abeta(25-35)-WT mice showed increased levels of NMDA-activated currents (INMDA) and NR2B phosphorylation (phospho-NR2B) in the hippocampal CA1 region at 48 h after Abeta25-35-injection (post-Abeta(25-35)) followed by approximately 40% decline at 72 h post-Abeta(25-35) of their respective control levels, which was inhibited by the sigma1R antagonist NE100. In Abeta(25-35)-WT mice, the administration of NR2B inhibitor Ro25-6981 or NE100 on day 1-4 post-Abeta(25-35) attenuated the memory deficits and loss of pyramidal cells. By contrast, Abeta(25-35)-sigma1R(+/-) mice showed a slight increase in the INMDA density and the phospho-NR2B at 48 h or 72 h post-Abeta25-35 compared to sigma1R(+/-) mice. Treatment with sigma1R agonist PRE084 in Abeta(25-35)-sigma1R(+/-) mice caused the same changes in the INMDA density and the phospho-NR2B as those in Abeta(25-35)-WT mice. Furthermore, Abeta(25-35)-sigma1R(+/-) mice treated with the NMDA receptor agonist NMDA or PRE084 on day 1-4 post-Abeta(25-35) showed a loss of neuronal cells and memory impairment. These results indicate that the sigma1R deficiency can reduce Abeta(25-35)-induced neuronal cell death and cognitive deficits through suppressing Abeta(25-35)-enhanced NR2B phosphorylation.",

    "title": "The multifaceted nature of amyloid precursor protein and its proteolytic fragments: friends and foes.",
    "abstract": "The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has occupied a central position in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology, in large part due to the seminal role of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), a proteolytic fragment derived from APP. Although the contribution of Abeta to AD pathogenesis is accepted by many in the research community, recent studies have unveiled a more complicated picture of APP's involvement in neurodegeneration in that other APP-derived fragments have been shown to exert pathological influences on neuronal function. However, not all APP-derived peptides are neurotoxic, and some even harbor neuroprotective effects. In this review, we will explore this complex picture by first discussing the pleiotropic effects of the major APP-derived peptides cleaved by multiple proteases, including soluble APP peptides (sAPPalpha, sAPPbeta), various C- and N-terminal fragments, p3, and APP intracellular domain fragments. In addition, we will highlight two interesting sequences within APP that likely contribute to this duality in APP function. First, it has been found that caspase-mediated cleavage of APP in the cytosolic region may release a cytotoxic peptide, C31, which plays a role in synapse loss and neuronal death. Second, recent studies have implicated the -YENPTY- motif in the cytoplasmic region as a domain that modulates several APP activities through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the first tyrosine residue. Thus, this review summarizes the current understanding of various APP proteolytic products and the interplay among them to gain deeper insights into the possible mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and AD pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brain is associated with memory decline in healthy individuals as a prelude to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Genetic factors may moderate this decline. We examined the role of apolipoprotein E (e4 carrier[e4(+)], e4 non-carrier[e4(-)]) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF(Val/Val), BDNF(Met)) in the extent to which they moderate Abeta-related memory decline. Healthy adults (n=333, Mage=70 years) enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study underwent Abeta neuroimaging. Neuropsychological assessments were conducted at baseline, 18-, 36- and 54-month follow-ups. Abeta positron emission tomography neuroimaging was used to classify participants as Abeta(-) or Abeta(+). Relative to Abeta(-)e4(-), Abeta(+)e4(+) individuals showed significantly faster rates of cognitive decline over 54 months across all domains (d=0.40-1.22), while Abeta(+)e4(-) individuals showed significantly faster decline only on verbal episodic memory (EM). There were no differences in rates of cognitive change between Abeta(-)e4(-) and Abeta(-)e4(+) groups. Among Abeta(+) individuals, e4(+)/BDNF(Met) participants showed a significantly faster rate of decline on verbal and visual EM, and language over 54 months compared with e4(-)/BDNF(Val/Val) participants (d=0.90-1.02). At least two genetic loci affect the rate of Abeta-related cognitive decline. Abeta(+)e4(+)/BDNF(Met) individuals can expect to show clinically significant memory impairment after 3 years, whereas Abeta(+)e4(+)/BDNF(Val/Val) individuals can expect a similar degree of impairment after 10 years. Little decline over 54 months was observed in the Abeta(-) and Abeta(+) e4(-) groups, irrespective of BDNF status. These data raise important prognostic issues in managing preclinical AD, and should be considered in designing secondary preventative clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-ss (Ass) fragments, oligomeric Ass aggregates, and pyroglutamylated-Ass peptides, as well as epigenetic mechanisms and autophagy dysfunction all appear to contribute in various ways to Alzheimer's disease progression. We previously showed that dietary supplementation of oleuropein aglycone, a natural phenol abundant in the extra virgin olive oil, can be protective by reducing Ass42 deposits in the brain of young and middle-aged TgCRND8 mice. Here, we extended our study to aged TgCRND8 mice showing increased pE3-Ass in the brain deposits. We report that oleuropein aglycone is active against glutaminylcyclase-catalyzed pE3-Ass generation reducing enzyme expression and interferes both with Ass42 and pE3-Ass aggregation. Moreover, the phenol astonishingly activates neuronal autophagy even in mice at advanced stage of pathology, where it increases histone 3 and 4 acetylation, which matches both a decrease of histone deacetylase 2 expression and a significant improvement of synaptic function. The occurrence of these functional, epigenetic, and histopathologic beneficial effects even at a late stage of the pathology suggests that the phenol could be beneficial at the therapeutic, in addition to the prevention, level.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been recently categorized as a gasotransmitter, and it may be involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. However, whether H2S induces amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing remains unknown. In the present study, we tested the ability of H2S to mediate APP processing in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. We treated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells with a range of sodium hydrosulfide (H2S donor) concentrations. Western blot analysis showed that H2S increased the generation of C83 and decreased the production of C99. Meanwhile, H2S increased the levels of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) mRNA and protein, but had no effect on TNF-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE, also known as ADAM17) mRNA and protein levels. H2S also induced a significant decrease of extracellular amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42). Furthermore, SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were assayed for activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway. H2S activated the PI3-K pathway. Using specific inhibitor of PI3-K, we determined that the effects of H2S on APP processing and Abeta42 were blocked by LY 294002 (PI3-K inhibitor). These data indicate that H2S can induce APP processing, and this effect is dependent on activation of the PI3-K signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Predicting rice (Oryza sativa) productivity under future climates is important for global food security. Ecophysiological crop models in combination with climate model outputs are commonly used in yield prediction, but uncertainties associated with crop models remain largely unquantified. We evaluated 13 rice models against multi-year experimental yield data at four sites with diverse climatic conditions in Asia and examined whether different modeling approaches on major physiological processes attribute to the uncertainties of prediction to field measured yields and to the uncertainties of sensitivity to changes in temperature and CO2 concentration [CO2 ]. We also examined whether a use of an ensemble of crop models can reduce the uncertainties. Individual models did not consistently reproduce both experimental and regional yields well, and uncertainty was larger at the warmest and coolest sites. The variation in yield projections was larger among crop models than variation resulting from 16 global climate model-based scenarios. However, the mean of predictions of all crop models reproduced experimental data, with an uncertainty of less than 10% of measured yields. Using an ensemble of eight models calibrated only for phenology or five models calibrated in detail resulted in the uncertainty equivalent to that of the measured yield in well-controlled agronomic field experiments. Sensitivity analysis indicates the necessity to improve the accuracy in predicting both biomass and harvest index in response to increasing [CO2 ] and temperature.",

    "abstract": "A major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in amyloid plaques. Abeta peptides are produced by sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein by the beta amyloid cleaving enzyme (BACE) and the gamma-secretase (gamma-sec) complex. Pharmacological treatments that decrease brain levels of in particular the toxic Abeta42 peptide are thought to be promising approaches for AD disease modification. Potent and selective BACE1 inhibitors as well as gamma-sec modulators (GSMs) have been designed. Pharmacological intervention of secretase function is not without risks of either on- or off-target adverse effects. One way of improving the therapeutic window could be to combine treatment on multiple targets, using smaller individual doses and thereby minimizing adverse effect liability. We show that combined treatment of primary cortical neurons with a BACE1 inhibitor and a GSM gives an additive effect on Abeta42 level change compared with the individual treatments. We extend this finding to C57BL/6 mice, where the combined treatment results in reduction of brain Abeta42 levels reflecting the sum of the individual treatment efficacies. These results show that pharmacological targeting of two amyloid precursor protein processing steps is feasible without negatively interfering with the mechanism of action on individual targets. We conclude that targeting Abeta production by combining a BACE inhibitor and a GSM could be a viable approach for therapeutic intervention in AD modification.",

    "abstract": "Small oligomers of amyloid beta (Abeta) are suspected to be the key to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, identifying these toxic species in the background of other similar but nontoxic Abeta aggregates has remained a challenge. Recent studies indicate that Abeta undergoes a global structural transition in an early step of aggregation. This transition is marked by a strong increase in its affinity for cell membranes, which suggests that the resultant oligomers could be the key to Abeta toxicity. Here we use this increased membrane affinity to develop a rapid, quantitative, cell-free assay for these bioactive oligomers. It uses fluorescence correlation spectroscopy of fluorescently labeled Abeta and requires only 30 s of measurement time. We also describe a simpler (though less rapid) assay based on the same principles, which uses a dialysis step followed by conventional fluorescence spectroscopy. Our results potentially provide a much-needed high-throughput assay for AD drug development.",

Epidemiologic evidence suggests that they could play a role in risk reduction in dementia. Amyloid precursor protein processing and the subsequent generation of amyloid beta (Abeta) are central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, as soluble, oligomeric Abeta is thought to be the toxic species driving disease progression. We undertook an in vitro screen to identify flavonoids with bioactivity at betagamma-mediated amyloid precursor protein processing, which lead to identification of a number of flavonoids bioactive at 100 nM. Because of known bioavailability, we investigated the catechin family further and identified epigallocatechin and (-)-epicatechin as potent (nanomolar) inhibitors of amyloidogenic processing. Supporting this finding, we have shown reduced Abeta pathology and Abeta levels following short term, a 21-day oral delivery of (-)-epicatechin in 7-month-old TASTPM mice. Further, in vitro mechanistic studies suggest this is likely because of indirect BACE1 inhibition. Taken together, our results suggest that orally delivered (-)-epicatechin may be a potential prophylactic for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides leading to deposition of senile plaques and a progressive decline of cognitive functions, which currently remains the main criterion for its diagnosis. Robust biomarkers for AD do not yet exist, although changes in the cerebrospinal fluid levels of tau and Abeta represent promising candidates in addition to brain imaging and genetic risk profiling. Although concentrations of soluble Abeta42 correlate with symptoms of AD, less is known about the biological activities of Abeta peptides which are generated from the amyloid-beta protein precursor. An unbiased DNA microarray study showed that Abeta42, at sub-lethal concentrations, specifically increases expression of several genes in neuroblastoma cells, notably the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins 3 and 5 (IGFBP3/5), the transcription regulator inhibitor of DNA binding, and the transcription factor Lim only domain protein 4. Using qRT-PCR, we confirmed that mRNA levels of the identified candidate genes were exclusively increased by the potentially neurotoxic Abeta42 wild-type peptide, as both the less toxic Abeta40 and a non-toxic substitution peptide Abeta42 G33A did not affect mRNA levels. In vivo immunohistochemistry revealed a corresponding increase in both hippocampal and cortical IGFBP5 expression in an AD mouse model. Proteomic analyses of human AD cerebrospinal fluid displayed increased in vivo concentrations of IGFBPs. IGFBPs and transcription factors, as identified here, are modulated by soluble Abeta42 and may represent useful early biomarkers.",

In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of Colivelin (CLN), a novel HN derivative, against Abeta by using behavioral test, in vivo electrophysiological recording, and intracellular calcium imaging. Our results showed that intrahippocampal injection of CLN (0.2 nmol) effectively prevented Abeta25-35 (4 nmol)-induced deficits in spatial learning and memory of rats in Morris water maze test; the suppression of in vivo hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) by Abeta25-35 was nearly completely prevented by CLN; in addition, CLN pretreatment also effectively inhibited Abeta25-35-induced calcium overload in primary cultured hippocampal neurons.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by the presence of misfolded proteins such as amyloid beta (Abeta) in senile plaques, and hyperphosphorylated tau and truncated tau in neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). The BRI2 protein inhibits Abeta aggregation via its BRICHOS domain and regulates critical proteins involved in initiating the amyloid cascade, which has been hypothesized to be central in AD pathogenesis. We recently detected the deposition of BRI2 ectodomain associated with Abeta plaques and concomitant changes in its processing enzymes in early stages of AD. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of recombinant BRI2 ectodomain (rBRI276-266) on Abeta aggregation and on important molecular pathways involved in early stages of AD, including the unfolded protein response (UPR), phosphorylation and truncation of tau, as well as apoptosis. We found that rBRI276-266 delays Abeta fibril formation, although less efficiently than the BRI2 BRICHOS domain (BRI2 residues 113-231). In human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, rBRI276-266 slightly decreased cell viability and increased up to two-fold the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the subsequent activity of caspases 3 and 9, indicating activation of apoptosis. rBRI276-266 upregulated the chaperone BiP but did not modify the mRNA expression of other UPR markers (CHOP and Xbp-1). Strikingly, rBRI276-266 induced the activation of GSK3beta but not the phosphorylation of tau. However, exposure to rBRI276-266 significantly induced the truncation of tau, indicating that BRI2 ectodomain can contribute to NFT formation. Since BRI2 can also regulate the metabolism of Abeta, the current data suggests that BRI2 ectodomain is a potential nexus between Abeta, tau pathology and neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides in the extracellular spaces of the brain as plaques and in the walls of blood vessels as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Failure of perivascular drainage of Abeta along cerebrovascular basement membranes contributes to the development of CAA. Mid-life hypercholesterolaemia is a risk factor for the development of AD. Maternal obesity is associated with the development of obesity, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia in adulthood, suggesting that the risk for AD and CAA may also be influenced by the early-life environment. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that early-life exposure to a high-fat diet results in changes to the cerebrovasculature and failure of Abeta clearance from the brain. We also assessed whether vascular Abeta deposition is greater in the brains of aged humans with a history of hyperlipidaemia, compared to age-matched controls with normal lipidaemia. Using a mouse model of maternal obesity, we found that exposure to a high-fat diet during gestation and lactation induced changes in multiple components of the neurovascular unit, including a down-regulation in collagen IV, fibronectin and apolipoprotein E, an up-regulation in markers of astrocytes and perivascular macrophages and altered blood vessel morphology in the brains of adult mice. Sustained high-fat diet over the entire lifespan resulted in additional decreases in levels of pericytes and impaired perivascular clearance of Abeta from the brain. In humans, vascular Abeta load was significantly increased in the brains of aged individuals with a history of hypercholesterolaemia. These results support a critical role for early dietary influence on the brain vasculature across the lifespan, with consequences for the development of age-related cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.",

These mutant Abeta peptides may also undergo accelerated aggregation and accumulation upon exposure to GM2 and GM3. We hypothesized that increasing beta-hexosaminidase (beta-hex) activity would lead to a reduction in GM2 levels, which in turn, would cause a reduction in Abeta aggregation and accumulation. The small molecule OT1001 is a beta-hex-targeted pharmacological chaperone with good bioavailability, blood-brain barrier penetration, high selectivity for beta-hex and low cytotoxicity. Dutch APP(E693Q) transgenic mice accumulate oligomeric Abeta as they age, as well as Abeta oligomer-dose-dependent anxiety and impaired novel object recognition (NOR). Treatment of Dutch APP(E693Q) mice with OT1001 caused a dose-dependent increase in brain beta-hex levels up to threefold over those observed at baseline. OT1001 treatment was associated with reduced anxiety, improved learning behavior in the NOR task and dramatically reduced GAbeta accumulation in the subiculum and perirhinal cortex, both of which are brain regions required for normal NOR. Pharmacological chaperones that increase beta-hex activity may be useful in reducing accumulation of certain mutant species of Abeta and in preventing the associated behavioral pathology.",

Expression profiling of small non-coding RNA's, microRNA (miRNA), has revealed diagnostic potential in human diseases. Circulating miRNA are found in small vesicles known as exosomes within biological fluids such as human serum. The aim of this work was to determine a set of differential exosomal miRNA biomarkers between healthy and AD patients, which may aid in diagnosis. Using next-generation deep sequencing, we profiled exosomal miRNA from serum (N=49) collected from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study (AIBL). Sequencing results were validated using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR; N=60), with predictions performed using the Random Forest method. Additional risk factors collected during the 4.5-year AIBL Study including clinical, medical and cognitive assessments, and amyloid neuroimaging with positron emission tomography were assessed. An AD-specific 16-miRNA signature was selected and adding established risk factors including age, sex and apolipoprotein e4 (APOE e4) allele status to the panel of deregulated miRNA resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 87% and 77%, respectively, for predicting AD. Furthermore, amyloid neuroimaging information for those healthy control subjects incorrectly classified with AD-suggested progression in these participants towards AD. These data suggest that an exosomal miRNA signature may have potential to be developed as a suitable peripheral screening tool for AD.",

    "title": "Hyperspectral imaging signatures detect amyloidopathy in Alzheimer's mouse retina well before onset of cognitive decline.",
    "abstract": "Amyloidopathic disorders such as Alzheimer's disease present symptomology years after the entrenchment of amyloidogenic imbalance. The pathologic alpha-helix   beta-strand conversion of amyloid beta(1-42) and amyloid beta(1-40) peptides causes neuronal death in the vicinity. Symptomology often presents only after significant neurodegeneration. This thus warrants early detection of amyloidopathy in Alzheimer's disease. Nonexistent modalities for direct identification and quantitation of soluble amyloid aggregates or (proto)fibrils forced us to undertake the development of a spectrophotometric technique to support ongoing drug design. Key requirements were independence from the need for extraneous staining, unambiguous amyloid aggregate detection, and minimal influence of interpretative errors. A Cytoviva instrument pivotal to this study captures scattering of light of visible-near-infrared (VNIR, 400-1000 nm) wavelengths within each pixel of the microscopic view field. We thus assembled a scattering intensity pattern database that provided \"signatures\" of amyloid aggregates. Comparison of unknown samples against this database enabled direct detection of amyloid aggregates. The technique was found useful for monitoring retinal and brain amyloidopathy in an ongoing preclinical anti-AD study, attesting to the technique's sensitivity and specificity. Interestingly, the technique was found applicable not just to excised brain tissue but also to isolated mouse retina. With the retina being heralded widely as a (diagnostic) extension of the CNS and retinal amyloidopathy occurring well before that in the brain, this development raises a possibility for the first direct retinal imaging diagnosis of early asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in age-related degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Maintenance of mitochondrial dynamics is essential for regulating mitochondrial function. Abeta oligomers (AbetaOs), the typical cause of AD, lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal loss. AbetaOs have been shown to induce mitochondrial fragmentation, and their inhibition suppresses mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal cell death. Oxidative stress is one of the earliest hallmarks of AD. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) may cause oxidative stress by disrupting the antioxidant system, including Prx2. Cdk5 is also regarded as a modulator of mitochondrial fission; however, a precise mechanistic link between Cdk5 and mitochondrial dynamics is lacking. We estimated mitochondrial morphology and alterations in mitochondrial morphology-related proteins in Neuro-2a (N2a) cells stably expressing the Swedish mutation of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is known to increase AbetaO production. We demonstrated that mitochondrial fragmentation by AbetaOs accompanies reduced mitofusin 1 and 2 (Mfn1/2) levels. Interestingly, the Cdk5 pathway, including phosphorylation of the Prx2-related oxidative stress, has been shown to regulate Mfn1 and Mfn2 levels. Furthermore, Mfn2, but not Mfn1, over-expression significantly inhibits the AbetaO-mediated cell death pathway. Therefore, these results indicate that AbetaO-mediated oxidative stress triggers mitochondrial fragmentation via decreased Mfn2 expression by activating Cdk5-induced Prx2 phosphorylation. Mitochondrial fragmentation induced by amyloid-beta oligomer (AbetaOs) which is generated from the Swedish mutation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) accompanies reduced Mfn1/2 levels. Interestingly, the Cdk5 pathway, including phosphorylation of the Prx2-related oxidative stress, has been shown to regulate Mfn1/2. Furthermore, Mfn2 over-expression significantly inhibits the AbetaO-mediated neuronal cells death pathway, but not Mfn1 over-expression. Therefore, these results indicate that AbetaO-mediated oxidative stress triggers mitochondrial fragmentation via decreased Mfn2 expression by activating Cdk5-induced Prx2 phosphorylation.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major age-associated form of dementia characterized by gradual cognitive decline. Aberrant cleavage of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is thought to play an important role in the pathology of this disease. Two principal AbetaPP processing pathways exist: amyloidogenic cleavage of AbetaPP resulting in production of the soluble N-terminal fragment sAbetaPPbeta, amyloid-beta (Abeta), which accumulates in AD brain, and the AbetaPP intracellular domain (AICD) sAbetaPPalpha, p3 and AICD are generated in the non-amyloidogenic pathway. Prevalence of amyloidogenic versus non-amyloidogenic processing leads to depletion of sAbetaPPalpha and an increase in Abeta. Although sAbetaPPalpha is a well-accepted neurotrophic protein, molecular effects of this fragment remains unknown. Different studies reported impaired protein degradation pathways in AD brain, pointing to a role of disturbed proteasomal activity in the pathogenesis of this disease. Here we studied the possible role of sAbetaPPalpha in Bag3-mediated selective macroautophagy and proteasomal degradation. Employing human IMR90 cells, HEK 293 cells, and primary neurons, we demonstrate that sAbetaPPalpha prevents the proteotoxic stress-induced increase of Bag3 at the protein and at the mRNA level indicating a transcriptional regulation. Intriguingly, p62 and LC3, two other key players of autophagy, were not affected. Moreover, the formation and the accumulation of disease-related protein aggregates were significantly reduced by sAbetaPPalpha. Interestingly, there was a significant increase of proteasomal activity by sAbetaPPalpha as demonstrated by using various proteasome substrates. Our findings demonstrate that sAbetaPPalpha modulates Bag3 expression, aggresome formation, and proteasomal activity, thereby providing first evidence for a function of sAbetaPPalpha in the regulation of proteostasis.",

    "title": "Systematic review of the relationship between amyloid-beta levels and measures of transgenic mouse cognitive deficit in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is believed to directly affect memory and learning in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is widely suggested that there is a relationship between Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels and cognitive performance. In order to explore the validity of this relationship, we performed a meta-analysis of 40 peer-reviewed, published AD transgenic mouse studies that quantitatively measured Abeta levels in brain tissue after assessing cognitive performance. We examined the relationship between Abeta levels (Abeta40, Abeta42, or the ratio of Abeta42 to Abeta40) and cognitive function as measured by escape latency times in the Morris water maze or exploratory preference percentage in the novel object recognition test. Our systematic review examined five mouse models (Tg2576, APP, PS1, 3xTg, APP(OSK)-Tg), gender, and age. The overall result revealed no statistically significant correlation between quantified Abeta levels and experimental measures of cognitive function. However, enough of the trends were of the same sign to suggest that there probably is a very weak qualitative trend visible only across many orders of magnitude. In summary, the results of the systematic review revealed that mice bred to show elevated levels of Abeta do not perform significantly worse in cognitive tests than mice that do not have elevated Abeta levels. Our results suggest two lines of inquiry: 1) Abeta is a biochemical \"side effect\" of the AD pathology; or 2) learning and memory deficits in AD are tied to the presence of qualitatively \"high\" levels of Abeta but are not quantitatively sensitive to the levels themselves.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB) plays an important role in multiple myeloma (MM), and bortezomib affects this pathway. We retrospectively analysed the effect of the NFKB1 -94ins/delATTG polymorphism on the survival of 295 MM patients treated at a single centre. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 790 (659-921) d in patients with NFKB1 homozygous insertion genotype (I/I, n = 99) and 624 (515-733) d in deletion-carriers (I/D&D/D, n = 196, P = 0 013). In multivariate analysis, I/I carriers showed a favourable PFS compared to I/D&D/D with a hazard ratio of 0 622 (0 457-0 847), P = 0 003, in addition to international staging system (ISS) score, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) risk score, age and bortezomib treatment. I/I patients benefited more from bortezomib treatment [PFS 902 (703-1101) and 580 (343-817), P = 0 008] than I/D&D/D patients [PFS 659 (487-831) and 488 (323-653), P = 0 531]; in addition the beneficial effect of low ISS score was not observed in the I/D&D/D group [PFS 639 (454-824) and 650 (458-842), P = 0 226], while it was clear in I/I patients [PFS 1140 (803-1477) and 580 (408-752), P < 0 001]. We conclude that homozygous carriers of the insertion allele of the NFKB1 -94ins/delATTG polymorphism have a better prognosis and probably benefit more from bortezomib treatment than MM patients carrying the deletion allele.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Recent large-scale genome-wide association studies have discovered several genetic variants associated with Alzheimer disease (AD); however, the extent to which DNA methylation in these AD loci contributes to the disease susceptibility remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of brain DNA methylation in 28 reported AD loci with AD pathologies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Ongoing community-based clinical pathological cohort studies of aging and dementia (the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project) among 740 autopsied participants 66.0 to 108.3 years old. EXPOSURES: DNA methylation levels at individual CpG sites generated from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue using a bead assay. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Pathological diagnosis of AD by National Institute on Aging-Reagan criteria following a standard postmortem examination. RESULTS: Overall, 447 participants (60.4%) met the criteria for pathological diagnosis of AD. Brain DNA methylation in SORL1, ABCA7, HLA-DRB5, SLC24A4, and BIN1 was associated with pathological AD. The association was robustly retained after replacing the binary trait of pathological AD with 2 quantitative and molecular specific hallmarks of AD, namely, Abeta load and paired helical filament tau tangle density. Furthermore, RNA expression of transcripts of SORL1 and ABCA7 was associated with paired helical filament tau tangle density, and the expression of BIN1 was associated with Abeta load. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Brain DNA methylation in multiple AD loci is associated with AD pathologies. The results provide further evidence that disruption of DNA methylation is involved in the pathological process of AD.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Perineural invasion (PNI) in prostate cancer has been associated with poor prognosis. We sought to determine whether biopsy and radical prostatectomy (RP) PNI are associated with adverse outcomes. A secondary objective was to determine whether prostate biopsy PNI should alter surgical technique. METHODS: Patients were categorized by PNI on biopsy and RP specimens. Associations between PNI, clinicopathologic characteristics, and biochemical recurrence (BCR) rates were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 2,500 patients undergoing open RP by a single-surgeon from 1999 to 2011 were analyzed. In unadjusted univariate analyses, biopsy PNI was significantly associated with Gleason score, clinical stage, positive surgical margins, extraprostatic extension (EPE), seminal vesicle invasion (SVI), positive lymph nodes, and BCR (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, EPE (p < 0.001), and SVI (p = 0.022) remained associated with biopsy PNI. Biopsy PNI was not associated with positive margins at RP (OR 1.3, 95 % CI 0.92-1.9). The presence of PNI in the final RP specimen conferred a greater than 4 times increased odds of positive margin (OR 4.6, 95 % CI 2.30-9.22; p < 0.0001). Men with PNI on biopsy were 1.5 times more likely to experience BCR (OR 1.5, 1.06-2.01). PNI on biopsy or RP specimens was not associated with overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: In men undergoing open RP for clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma, biopsy PNI is associated with an increased risk of BCR. PNI on prostate biopsy was not associated with positive surgical margins after adjusting for related co-variables. The presence of PNI on prostate biopsy should not preclude utilization of a nerve-sparing approach.",

    "abstract": "The pathological mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) needs to be elucidated. The Bcl-2 associated athanogene 5 (Bag5) is an important member in the Bag family. However, the role of Bag5 in AD has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we found that expression of Bag5 is elevated in the brains of AD transgenic Tg2576 mice at both mRNA levels and proteins. In vitro experiments indicated that Abeta1-42 treatment led to the upregulation of Bag5 in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, our results indicated that inhibition of Bag5 using small RNA interferences exacerbated Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity. On one hand, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay demonstrated that inhibition of Bag5 exacerbated Abeta1-42-related cell death. On the other hand, silence of endogenous Bag5 promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) induced by Abeta1-42. Finally and importantly, it was shown that knockdown of Bag5 exacerbated Abeta1-42-induced apoptosis and caspase-3 cleavage. These data suggest that induction of Bag5 might have a neuroprotective effect in AD.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages are key cells in tissue defense in the periphery and, under certain circumstances, infiltrate the central nervous system, where they may play a similar role in the brain, perhaps supporting the function of microglia. Macrophages have been shown to adopt different activation states in response to various stimuli. Specifically, when exposed to inflammatory stimuli such as interferon (IFN)gamma, the cells adopt the M1 phenotype, whereas when exposed to anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4 or IL-13, the M2 phenotype is adopted. While M1 macrophages are associated with tissue defense and destruction of invading pathogens, M2 macrophages are involved in tissue repair and in terminating inflammation. It is well known that an inflammatory microenvironment exists in the brain of aged animals and also in the brain of mice that overexpress amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) and presenilin 1 (PS1; AbetaPP/PS1 mice), a commonly-used model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have revealed that immune cells, including macrophages, infiltrate the brain in both circumstances raising the possibility that these cells adopt the M1 activation state and contribute to the already-existing neuroinflammation. We set out to examine the responses of bone marrow-derived macrophages prepared from wildtype and AbetaPP/PS1 mice and demonstrate that cells from AbetaPP/PS1 mice, even after several days in culture, respond more profoundly to IFNgamma than those from wildtype mice. We suggest that this propensity to respond to M1-polarizing stimuli, together with the described changes in the brain of AbetaPP/PS1 mice, contribute to the development of chronic neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid plaques, the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), contain fibrillar beta-amyloid (Abeta) 1-40 and 1-42 peptides. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) has been implicated as a risk factor for AD and found to co-localize within amyloid plaques. Abeta 1-40 and Abeta 1-42 display anti-bacterial, anti-yeast and anti-viral activities. Here, fibroblast, epithelial and neuronal cell lines were exposed to Abeta 1-40 or Abeta 1-42 and challenged with HSV-1. Quantitative analysis revealed that Abeta 1-40 and Abeta 1-42 inhibited HSV-1 replication when added 2 h prior to or concomitantly with virus challenge, but not when added 2 or 6 h after virus addition. In contrast, Abeta 1-40 and Abeta 1-42 did not prevent replication of the non-enveloped human adenovirus. In comparison, antimicrobial peptide LL-37 prevented HSV-1 infection independently of its sequence of addition. Our findings showed also that Abeta 1-40 and Abeta 1-42 acted directly on HSV-1 in a cell-free system and prevented viral entry into cells. The sequence homology between Abeta and a proximal transmembrane region of HSV-1 glycoprotein B suggested that Abeta interference with HSV-1 replication could involve its insertion into the HSV-1 envelope. Our data suggest that Abeta peptides represent a novel class of antimicrobial peptides that protect against neurotropic enveloped virus infections such as HSV-1. Overproduction of Abeta peptide to protect against latent herpes viruses and eventually against other infections, may contribute to amyloid plaque formation, and partially explain why brain infections play a pathogenic role in the progression of the sporadic form of AD.",

How these FAD-related mutants increase the aggregative ability of Abeta is not fully understood. Here, we characterized the effect of the Arctic variant (E22G) on the conformational stability of Abeta using various forms of spectroscopy and kinetic analyses, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The E22G mutation in the Arctic variant reduced the alpha-helical propensity and conformational stability of Abeta on residues 15-25. This mutation also caused an increase in both alpha-helix-to-beta-strand conversion and fibril nucleation rates. Our results suggest that the alpha-helical propensity of residues 15-25 may play a determinant role in the aggregative ability of Abeta. This may provide a structural basis for understanding the molecular mechanism of Abeta aggregation.",

The complex pathogenesis of AD suggests that it requires comprehensive treatment, and drugs with multiple functions against AD are more desirable. Herein, AuNPs@POMD-pep (AuNPs: gold nanoparticles, POMD: polyoxometalate with Wells-Dawson structure, pep: peptide) were designed as a novel multifunctional Abeta inhibitor. AuNPs@POMD-pep shows synergistic effects in inhibiting Abeta aggregation, dissociating Abeta fibrils and decreasing Abeta-mediated peroxidase activity and Abeta-induced cytotoxicity. By taking advantage of AuNPs as vehicles that can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), AuNPs@POMD-pep can cross the BBB and thus overcome the drawbacks of small-molecule anti-AD drugs. Thus, this work provides new insights into the design and synthesis of inorganic nanoparticles as multifunctional therapeutic agents for treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "The formation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide aggregates, oligomers, and fibrils is a dynamic process; however, the kinetics of their formation is not well understood. This study compares the time course of aggregate/fibril formation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses with that of oligomer/fibril formation by Western blot analysis under native and denaturing conditions. Efforts to deaggregate/defibrillate these peptides by using hexafluoroisopropanol, ammonium hydroxide, or dimethylsulfoxide did not change the nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) footprints or drive the peptides to a monomeric species. Regardless of the pretreatment protocol, TEM analyses reveal that all Abeta peptides (Abeta40, Abeta42, Abeta39E22Delta [Osaka], Abeta40E22G [Arctic], Abeta40E22Q [Dutch], and Abeta40A2T [Icelandic]) immediately formed nonfibrillar, amorphous aggregates when first placed into solution with the Osaka mutation, quickly forming early-stage fibrils. The extent of fibril formation for other Abeta peptides is time dependent, with the Arctic mutation forming fibrils at 1 hr, the Dutch and Icelandic at 4 hr, Abeta42 at 8 hr, and Abeta40 at 24 hr. In contrast, nondenaturing PAGE revealed unique footprints for the different Abeta species. The rapidity of aggregate formation and the rapid transition to fibrils, particularly for the Osaka deletion, suggest an important role for aggregates/fibrils of Abeta in the development of neuronal degeneration.",

A total of 34 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group (n = 8), DM group (n = 8), DM group treated with a low dose of P165 (n = 9), and DM group treated with a high dose of P165 (n = 9). After 8 weeks of treatment, the animals were killed and the expression of insulin signaling-related proteins was examined in the hippocampus by Western blot and immunohistochemical staining. Administration of P165 in diabetic rats did not induce a significant effect on the fasting blood glucose level. The expression of IR, IRS-1, AKT, p-CREB, and Bcl-2 proteins was significantly enhanced in the hippocampus in diabetic rats. Treatment of diabetic rats with P165 at both low and high doses significantly attenuated the expression levels of these proteins. Moreover, immunohistochemistry staining showed that IR, IRS-1, AKT, p-CREB, and Bcl-2 were abundantly expressed in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The number of cells positively stained for the above proteins was significantly higher in diabetic tissues compared to control tissues, whereas P165 treatments induced a significant reduction in the expression of these proteins. The expression of IR, IRS-1, AKT, p-CREB, and Bcl-2 was enhanced in DM rats, and administration of P165 normalized the expression of these molecules, suggesting that P165 can improve impaired insulin signal transduction.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To define the genetic landscape of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and assess the contribution of possible oligogenic inheritance, we aimed to comprehensively sequence 17 known ALS genes in 391 ALS patients from the United States. METHODS: Targeted pooled-sample sequencing was used to identify variants in 17 ALS genes. Fragment size analysis was used to define ATXN2 and C9ORF72 expansion sizes. Genotype-phenotype correlations were made with individual variants and total burden of variants. Rare variant associations for risk of ALS were investigated at both the single variant and gene level. RESULTS: A total of 64.3% of familial and 27.8% of sporadic subjects carried potentially pathogenic novel or rare coding variants identified by sequencing or an expanded repeat in C9ORF72 or ATXN2; 3.8% of subjects had variants in >1 ALS gene, and these individuals had disease onset 10 years earlier (p = 0.0046) than subjects with variants in a single gene. The number of potentially pathogenic coding variants did not influence disease duration or site of onset. INTERPRETATION: Rare and potentially pathogenic variants in known ALS genes are present in >25% of apparently sporadic and 64% of familial patients, significantly higher than previous reports using less comprehensive sequencing approaches. A significant number of subjects carried variants in >1 gene, which influenced the age of symptom onset and supports oligogenic inheritance as relevant to disease pathogenesis.",

Among cytokines involved in microglial activation, amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide is known to be a key molecule in the induction of diverse inflammatory products, which may lead to chronic inflammation in AD. However, proteomic studies of microglia in AD are limited due to lack of proper cell or animal model systems. In this study, we performed a proteomic analysis of Abeta-stimulated human microglial cells using SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) combined with LC-MS/MS. Results showed that 60 proteins increased or decreased their abundance by 1.5 fold or greater. Among these, ER-resident proteins such as SERPINH1, PDIA6, PDIA3, and PPIB were revealed to be key molecular biomarkers of human microglial activation by validation of the proteomic results by immunostaining, PCR, ELISA, and Western blot. Taken together, our data suggest that ER proteins play an essential role in human microglial activation by Abeta and may be important molecular therapeutic targets for treatment of AD.",

Easily obtained and expanded from the bone marrow and other tissues, MSCs have been proposed as candidates for stem cell therapy in various neurodegenerartive diseases. In the present study, we sought to explore these therapeutic properties of MSC on Ass25-35-induced pathology when coadministered together. Apparently, coadministration of MSC prevented mild cognitive deficits observed following Ass administration alone, by promoting microglial activation and rapid clearance of injected Ass aggregates. Surprisingly, increased hippocampal neurogenesis was observed in the Ass-injected animals and was normal in MSC-coadministered animals just as in control animals. The observed increase in neurogenesis can be explained as a compensating mechanism responsible for the mild and temporary cognitive deficits observed in the Morris water maze assay in Ass-injected animals. Interestingly, MSC engrafted not only to the hippocampus but were also detected in the choroid plexus. We thus conclude that MSC may act in multiple pathways to protect the CNS from Ass pathology, while neurogenesis is a possible compensating mechanism; it is not always activated by MSC, which in turn may interact with local immune cells to regulate Ass accumulation.",

    "abstract": "We retrospectively investigated the prognostic factor of lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) in Japanese patients with refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma (RRMM) registered in the Kansai Myeloma Forum from January 2006 to December 2013. A total of 140 patients were analyzed. The median age was 66 years. The overall response rate was 68.6 %, including 33.1 % with a better than very good partial response. At 13.0 months median follow-up, the median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 34.2 and 17.0 months, respectively. In univariate analyses, patients with one or two prior therapies had significantly longer OS (41.2 vs. 21.5 months; P = 0.002) and PFS (29.0 vs. 13.0 months; P = 0.006) than patients treated with three or more prior therapies. Prior use of thalidomide was associated with significantly shorter PFS (19.0 vs. 16.0 months; P = 0.045). The prior use of bortezomib or high-dose therapy with stem cell transplantation, and the International Staging System had no impact on long-term outcome. Multivariate analysis showed that only the number of prior therapies was a significant predictor of both OS and PFS. Our findings suggest that greater benefit may occur when Rd therapy is used at the first or second relapse in RRMM.",

    "title": "Subretinal injection of amyloid-beta peptide accelerates RPE cell senescence and retinal degeneration.",
    "abstract": "Drusen are considered a hallmark characteristic of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In our previous study, we found that amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, a component of drusen, induced the cells of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE; RPE cells) to enter senescence; however, its effects in vivo remain unknown. Thus, the present study was carried out to explore the in vivo effects of Abeta peptide on RPE cell senescence and senescence-associated inflammation in C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 mice received a subretinal injection of Abeta(1-42) peptide; on day 7 post-injection, the mice were anesthetized and subjected to whole-body perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS and the whole eyes were then enucleated. Retinal function was assessed by electroretinography (ERG), and the morphological characteristics of the retina were examined by light and electron microscopy. Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) was examined by confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO). The expression of p16INK4a, a marker of cellular senescence, was examined by immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis. The RPE-choroid was analyzed for cytokine expression by RT-PCR. In Abeta(1-42)-injected mice, scotopic ERG responses declined. Degenerative alterations, including the disruption of the inner segment (IS)/outer segment (OS) junction and extensive vacuolation and thickness of Bruch's membrane (BrM) were observed under a a light microscope. The accumulation of vacuoles and the loss of basal infoldings in the RPE were identified using an electron microscope. FAF and p16INK4a expression increased in Abeta(1-42)-injected mice. In addition, Abeta(1-42) upregulated interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 gene expression in the RPE-choroid. In conclusion, our results confirm the effects of Abeta(1-42) peptide on RPE senescence in vivo. The Abeta-injected mice developed AMD-like ocular pathology. It is thus suggested that RPE cell senescence is a potential mechanistic link between inflammation and retinal degeneration.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Progression-free survival (PFS) has previously been established as a surrogate for overall survival (OS) for first-line metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Because mCRC treatment has advanced in the last decade with extended OS, this surrogacy requires re-examination. METHODS: Individual patient data from 16,762 patients were available from 22 first-line mCRC studies conducted from 1997 to 2006; 12 of those studies tested antiangiogenic and/or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor agents. The relationship between PFS (first event of progression or death) and OS was evaluated by using R(2) statistics (the closer the value is to 1, the stronger the correlation) from weighted least squares regression of trial-specific hazard ratios estimated by using Cox and Copula models. RESULTS: Forty-four percent of patients received a regimen that included biologic agents. Median first-line PFS was 8.3 months, and median OS was 18.2 months. The correlation between PFS and OS was modest (R(2), 0.45 to 0.69). Analyses limited to trials that tested treatments with biologic agents, nonstrategy trials, or superiority trials did not improve surrogacy. CONCLUSION: In modern mCRC trials, in which survival after the first progression exceeds time to first progression, a positive but modest correlation was observed between OS and PFS at both the patient and trial levels. This finding demonstrates the substantial variability in OS introduced by the number of lines of therapy and types of effective subsequent treatments and the associated challenge to the use of OS as an end point to assess the benefit attributable to a single line of therapy. PFS remains an appropriate primary end point for first-line mCRC trials to detect the direct treatment effect of new agents.",

Combined Abeta42 and t-tau distinguishes AD from healthy controls with a sensitivity and specificity (sens/spec) near 89% across studies. This study examined these markers in the homogeneous OPTIMA cohort, using extensive longitudinal follow up and postmortem evaluation to confirm clinicopathological status. Baseline CSF was analyzed from 227 participants with AD (97% autopsy-confirmed), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; 73% confirmed), other dementia syndrome (ODS; 100% confirmed), and controls (CTL; 27% confirmed, follow up approximately 9-13 years). Biomarker concentrations were analyzed using validated ELISAs. AD patients had lower CSF Abeta42 and higher t-tau, p-tau, t-tau/Abeta42, and t-tau/Abeta40 compared to CTLs, with MCI intermediate. CTL and MCI participants who progressed to AD demonstrated more AD-like profiles. Abeta40, sAbetaPPalpha, and sAbetaPPbeta were lower in AD compared to CTL. High-level discriminators of AD from CTL were t-tau/Abeta40 (AUROC 0.986, sens/spec of 92%/94%), p-tau/Abeta42 (AUROC 0.972, sens/spec of 94%/90%), and Abeta42 (AUROC 0.941, sens/spec of 88%). For discriminating AD from ODS, p-tau/Abeta42 demonstrated sens/spec of 88%/100% (95%/86% at the AD versus CTL cutoff) and Abeta42 demonstrated sens/spec of 84%/100% (88%/100% at the AD versus CTL cutoff). In a well-characterized, homogeneous population, a single cutoff for baseline CSF Abeta and tau markers can distinguish AD with a high level of sens/spec compared to other studies. It may be important to characterize sources of demographic and biological variability to support the effective use of CSF diagnostic assays in the broader AD population.",

However, the location(s) of proteolytic processing and subsequent secretion of APP fragments from highly compartmentalized, euploid neurons that express APP and processing enzymes at normal levels is not well understood. To probe the behavior of endogenous APP, particularly in human neurons, we developed a system using neurons differentiated from human embryonic stem cells, cultured in microfluidic devices, to enable direct biochemical measurements from axons. Using human or mouse neurons in these devices, we measured levels of Abeta, sAPPalpha, and sAPPbeta secreted solely from axons. We found that a majority of the fragments secreted from axons were processed in the soma, and many were dependent on somatic endocytosis for axonal secretion. We also observed that APP and the beta-site APP cleaving enzyme were, for the most part, not dependent on endocytosis for axonal entry. These data establish that axonal entry and secretion of APP and its proteolytic processing products traverse different pathways in the somatodendritic compartment before axonal entry.",

The physiological role of extracellular chaperones, capable of affecting early events in the amyloid cascade, is increasingly being investigated by many research groups. Among these proteins, we focused on haptoglobin, which we recently found to form a complex with beta-amyloid in brain tissues or cerebrospinal fluids from patients with AD. We also previously reported that haptoglobin increases with age in rat hippocampus. Major aim of this study was to evaluate whether haptoglobin influences Abeta interaction with astrocytes and its internalization into these cells. Haptoglobin effect on Abeta-induced cell death was also explored. We report here that haptoglobin impairs Abeta uptake by human glioblastoma-astrocytoma cell line U-87 MG and limits the toxicity of this peptide on these cells. Of note, our data also show that Abeta can stimulate haptoglobin release by astrocyte cell lines. The study of the risk of developing AD should be focused not only on the analysis of Abeta but also on the level of critical ligands, such as haptoglobin, able to influence peptide aggregation or clearance.",

Here the amyloid-beta (12-28) peptide fragment (monomer) and its dimer are characterized at low pH through the modeling of their diffusion coefficients and effective electrophoretic mobilities. Translational diffusion coefficient experimental values of monomer and dimer analogs of this peptide fragment and monomer and dimer mixtures at thermodynamic equilibrium are used as reported in the literature for different monomer initial concentrations. The resulting electrokinetic and hydrodynamic global properties are employed to evaluate the amyloid-beta (12-28) peptide fragment propensity to dimerization through a thermodynamic theoretical framework. Therefore equilibrium constants are considered at pH 2.9 to elucidate one of the amyloidogenic mechanisms involving the central hydrophobic region LVFFA of the peptide spanning residues 17-21 associated with phenylalanine at positions 19 and 20 in the amino acid sequence of amyloid-beta peptides. An analysis demonstrating that peptide aggregation is a concentration-dependent process is provided, where both pair and intraparticle charge regulation phenomena become relevant. It is shown that the modeling of the effective electrophoretic mobility of the amyloid-beta (12-28) peptide fragment is crucial to understand the effect of hydrophobic region LVFFA in the amyloidogenic process.",

    "abstract": "Soluble factors from CD8(+) T cells and cervicovaginal mucosa of women are recognized as important in controlling human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and transmission. Previously, we have shown the strong anti-HIV-1 activity of prothymosin alpha (ProTalpha) derived from CD8(+) T cells. ProTalpha is a small acidic protein with wide cell distribution, to which several functions have been ascribed, depending on its intracellular or extracellular localization. To date, activities of ProTalpha have been attributed to a single protein known as isoform 2. Here we report the isolation and identification of 2 new ProTalpha variants from CD8(+) T cells and cervicovaginal lavage with potent anti-HIV-1 activity. The first is a splice variant of the ProTalpha gene, known as isoform CRA_b, and the second is the product of a ProTalpha gene, thus far classified as a pseudogene 7. Native or recombinant ProTalpha variants potently restrict HIV-1 replication in macrophages through the induction of type I interferon. The baseline expression of interferon-responsive genes in primary human cervical tissues positively correlate with high levels of intracellular ProTalpha, and the knockdown of ProTalpha variants by small interfering RNA leads to downregulation of interferon target genes. Overall, these findings suggest that ProTalpha variants are innate immune mediators involved in immune surveillance.",

    "abstract": "The neural type I membrane protein Alcadein alpha (Alcalpha), is primarily cleaved by amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) alpha-secretase to generate a membrane-associated carboxyl-terminal fragment (Alcalpha CTF), which is further cleaved by gamma-secretase to secrete p3-Alcalpha peptides and generate an intracellular cytoplasmic domain fragment (Alcalpha ICD) in the late secretory pathway. By association with the neural adaptor protein X11L (X11-like), Alcalpha and APP form a ternary complex that suppresses the cleavage of both Alcalpha and APP by regulating the transport of these membrane proteins into the late secretory pathway where secretases are active. However, it has not been revealed how Alcalpha and APP are directed from the ternary complex formed largely in the Golgi into the late secretory pathway to reach a nerve terminus. Using a novel transgenic mouse line expressing excess amounts of human Alcalpha CTF (hAlcalpha CTF) in neurons, we found that expression of hAlcalpha CTF induced excess production of hAlcalpha ICD, which facilitated APP transport into the nerve terminus and enhanced APP metabolism, including Abeta generation. In vitro cell studies also demonstrated that excess expression of Alcalpha ICD released both APP and Alcalpha from the ternary complex. These results indicate that regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Alcalpha by gamma-secretase regulates APP trafficking and the production of Abeta in vivo.",

The blood cellular fractions offer a viable alternative to current cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging modalities. The current study aimed to replicate our earlier reports of altered binding within the AD-affected blood cellular fraction to copper-loaded immobilized metal affinity capture (IMAC) arrays. IMAC and anti-amyloid-beta (Abeta) antibody arrays coupled with mass spectrometry were used to analyze blood samples collected from 218 participants from within the AIBL Study of Aging. Peripheral Abeta was fragile and prone to degradation in the AIBL samples, even when stored at -80 C. IMAC analysis of the AIBL samples lead to the isolation and identification of alpha-defensins 1 and 2 at elevated levels in the AD periphery, validating earlier findings. Alpha-defensins 1 and 2 were elevated in AD patients indicating that an inflammatory phenotype is present in the AD periphery; however, peripheral Abeta levels are required to supplement their prognostic power.",

    "title": "Neprilysin deficiency alters the neuropathological and behavioral phenotype in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "The deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is one of the major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the case of sporadic AD, an imbalance in Abeta in production and clearance seems to be the reason for an enhanced Abeta accumulation. Besides a systematic clearance through the blood-brain barrier, Abeta is cleared from the brain by Abeta-degrading enzymes. The metalloprotease neprilysin (NEP) is an important Abeta-degrading enzyme as shown by numerous in vitro, in vivo and reverse genetics studies. 5XFAD mice represent an early-onset AD mouse model which develops plaque pathology starting with 2 months of age in addition to robust behavioral deficits at later time points. By crossing 5XFAD mice with homozygous NEP-knock-out mice (NEP-/-), we show that hemizygous NEP deficiency aggravates the behavioral and neuropathological phenotype of 5XFAD mice. We found that 5XFAD mice per se showed strongly decreased NEP expression levels compared to wildtype mice, which was aggravated by NEP reduction. 5XFAD/NEP+/- mice demonstrated impairment in spatial working memory and increased astrocytosis in all studied brain areas, in addition to an overall increased level of soluble Abeta42 as well as region-specific increases in extracellular Abeta deposition. Surprisingly, in young mice, a more abundant cortical Abeta plaque pathology was observed in 5XFAD compared to 5XFAD/NEP+/- mice. Additionally, young 5XFAD/NEP+/- as well as hemi- and homozygous NEP knockout mice showed elevated levels of endothelin-converting enzyme 1 (ECE1), suggesting a mutual regulation of ECE1 and NEP at young ages. The present data indicate that NEP mainly degrades soluble Abeta peptides, which confirms previous observations. Increased ECE1 levels correlated well with the strongly reduced extracellular plaque load in young 5XFAD/NEP+/- mice and might suggest a reciprocal effect between ECE and NEP activities in Abeta degradation.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder histologically characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein accumulation and activation of associated microglia. Although these features are well described in the central nervous system, the process and consequences of Abeta accumulation in the enteric nervous system have not been extensively studied. We hypothesized that Abeta also may accumulate in the enteric nervous system and lead to immune cell activation and neuronal dysfunction in the digestive tract not unlike that observed in diseased brain. To test this hypothesis, ileums of the small intestine of thirteen month old AbetaPP/PS1 and C57BL/6 (wild type) mice were collected and analyzed using immunohistochemistry, western blot analysis, cytokine arrays, and ELISA. AbetaPP/PS1 mice demonstrated no differences in intestinal motility or water absorption but elevated luminal IgA levels compared to wild type mice. They also had increased protein levels of AbetaPP and the proteolytic enzyme, BACE, corresponding to an increase in Abeta1-40 in the intestinal lysate as well as an increase in both Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 in the stool. This correlated with increased protein markers of proinflammatory and immune cell activation. Histologic analysis localized AbetaPP within enteric neurons but also intestinal epithelial cells with elevated Abeta immunoreactivity in the AbetaPP/PS1 mice. The presence of AbetaPP, Abeta, and CD68 immunoreactivity in the intestines of some patients with neuropathologically-confirmed AD are consistent with the findings in this mouse model. These data support the hypothesis that in AD the intestine, much like the brain, may develop proinflammatory and immune changes related to AbetaPP and Abeta.",

    "abstract": "The toxic effect of Abeta42 induced by copper nanoparticle (Cu NPs) was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence technique. Five hundred nanometers of copper nanoparticle capped with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was used to evaluate the aggregation and fibrils of Abeta42. The morphologies of Abeta42 incubated in the presence of Cu NPs changed gradually. The aggregation and fibrils were observed in AFM images. However, in the presence of polysaccharides, the Cu NPs-induced fibrillation of Abeta42 was inhibited. Interestingly, the formed Cu NPs-polysaccharides complexes can even remodel the preformed Abeta42 fibrils into the low neurotoxic amorphous aggregates, which were maybe ascribed to the higher affinity of polysaccharides for Abeta42 than Cu NPs. Besides, it was found that the binding constant of Cu NPs to Abeta42 is smaller than that of polysaccharides. The relationship among polysaccharides, copper nanoparticle, and Abeta42 morphologies and its neurotoxicity were discussed, and the binding force was analyzed.",

The purpose of this systematic review is to examine the relationship between amyloid-beta (Abeta), a key biomarker of AD, and depression in older adults. METHOD: The literature search was limited to studies conducted from 2006 to 2014 that were published in English in peer-reviewed journals. Studies were selected if they included a group of older adults who either met established criteria for Major Depressive Disorder or Dysthymia; or were assessed for depressive symptoms on a standardised measure. Studies were also required to include an outcome variable that was a direct measure of Abeta levels in either blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, or via neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET). RESULTS: Nineteen studies were identified, 15 of which found significant differences in Abeta levels between depressed and non-depressed older adults. However, studies were limited by their cross-sectional design, reliance on blood-based measures of Abeta, and potential sample bias. CONCLUSIONS: Future investigations should consider prospective longitudinal design using neuroimaging and CSF measures of Abeta.",

Apart from the rare early-onset familiar forms, these neurodegenerative diseases are age-associated disorders whose symptoms appear in aged people after long incubation periods. This makes the therapeutic approach particularly compelling and boosts the search for both early diagnostic tools and preventive approaches. In this last respect, natural compounds commonly present in foods and beverages are considered promising molecules, at least on the bench side. The so-called 'nutraceutical approach' suggests life-long healthy diets, particularly focusing on food molecules that are candidates to enter clinical trials as such or following a targeted molecular engineering. Natural phenols abundant in 'healthy' foods such as extra virgin olive oil, red wine, green tea, red berries and spices, appear particularly promising.",

    "abstract": "AIM: The purpose of our study is to investigate clinically significant prognostic factors at the time of interval surgery (IS), comprising interval look surgery and interval debulking surgery, for T3c (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIIc to IV) advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) patients during primary treatment. METHODS: We reviewed records of patients with T3c AOC who underwent IS following neoadjuvant chemotherapy or up-front primary debulking surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy at our institution between January 1996 and December 2010. For analysis of prognostic factors, cytology of peritoneal exfoliative cells at IS was added to clinicopathological variables. RESULTS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 50 cases. The median age was 61.1 years (range, 38-78), with median follow-up of 45.9 months (range, 12-122). Macroscopic tumors were completely resected in 32 cases (64%) at IS. Univariate analyses of clinicopathological factors for IS identified preoperative serum cancer antigen-125 levels (>=20 IU/mL; P = 0.0539), number of residual lesions at IS (>=20; P = 0.0554), incomplete surgery at IS (P = 0.0171) and positive peritoneal cytology at IS (P = 0.0015) as significant factors for prognosis regarding progression-free survival (PFS). Multivariate analysis identified positive peritoneal cytology (P = 0.0303) as a unique independent predictor of poor prognosis in PFS. CONCLUSION: Positive peritoneal cytology at IS appears to be a significant factor for poor prognosis in PFS, which may provide useful information for post-IS chemotherapy planning. IS in the treatment of AOC may be useful for not only complete resection, but also for identification of patients with poor prognosis.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Several epidemiological studies have found a lower incidence of Alzheimer's disease in highly educated populations, but the protective mechanism of education against the disease is still unclear. Our objective was to investigate the association between education and (11) C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) uptake with positron emission tomography in participants with normal cognitive ability. METHODS: We performed (11) C-labeled PIB positron emission tomography and neuropsychological testing in 30 cognitively normal older participants. Of the participants, 16 had a period of education less than 12 years (low-education group) and 14 had more than 13 years (high-education group). Amyloid-beta deposition was quantified by binding potential (BPND ) in several brain regions and was compared between the groups with different education levels. RESULTS: We found significantly higher cortical PIB-BPND in the cognitively normal participants with low education compared with the ones with high education. None of the brain regions in low-education group showed significantly lower BPND values. This finding was not affected by the inclusion of possible confounding variables such as age, sex, and general intelligence. Our findings indicated a reduced amyloid pathology in highly educated, cognitively normal, participants. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings lead to the proposal that early-life education has a negative association with Alzheimer's disease pathology. This proposal is not in opposition to the brain reserve hypothesis. People with more education might be prone to a greater inhibitory effect against amyloid-beta deposition before the preclinical stage. At the same time, they have a greater reserve capacity, and greater pathological changes are required for dementia to manifest.",

    "abstract": "The key role of APP in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease is well established. However, postnatal lethality of double knockout mice has so far precluded the analysis of the physiological functions of APP and the APLPs in the brain. Previously, APP family proteins have been implicated in synaptic adhesion, and analysis of the neuromuscular junction of constitutive APP/APLP2 mutant mice showed deficits in synaptic morphology and neuromuscular transmission. Here, we generated animals with a conditional APP/APLP2 double knockout (cDKO) in excitatory forebrain neurons using NexCre mice. Electrophysiological recordings of adult NexCre cDKOs indicated a strong synaptic phenotype with pronounced deficits in the induction and maintenance of hippocampal LTP and impairments in paired pulse facilitation, indicating a possible presynaptic deficit. These deficits were also reflected in impairments in nesting behavior and hippocampus-dependent learning and memory tasks, including deficits in Morris water maze and radial maze performance. Moreover, while no gross alterations of brain morphology were detectable in NexCre cDKO mice, quantitative analysis of adult hippocampal CA1 neurons revealed prominent reductions in total neurite length, dendritic branching, reduced spine density and reduced spine head volume. Strikingly, the impairment of LTP could be selectively rescued by acute application of exogenous recombinant APPsalpha, but not APPsbeta, indicating a crucial role for APPsalpha to support synaptic plasticity of mature hippocampal synapses on a rapid time scale. Collectively, our analysis reveals an essential role of APP family proteins in excitatory principal neurons for mediating normal dendritic architecture, spine density and morphology, synaptic plasticity and cognition.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is biochemically characterized by increased levels of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, which aggregates into extracellular Abeta plaques in AD brains. Before plaque formation, Abeta accumulates intracellularly in both AD brains and in the brains of AD model mice, which may contribute to disease progression. Autophagy, which is impaired in AD, clears cellular protein aggregates and participates in Abeta metabolism. In addition to a degradative role of autophagy in Abeta metabolism we recently showed that Abeta secretion is inhibited in mice lacking autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7) in excitatory neurons in the mouse forebrain. This inhibition of Abeta secretion leads to intracellular accumulation of Abeta. Here, we used fluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy to elucidate the subcellular localization of the intracellular Abeta accumulation which accumulates in Abeta precursor protein mice lacking Atg7. Autophagy deficiency causes accumulation of p62(+) aggregates, but these aggregates do not contain Abeta. However, knockdown of Atg7 induced Abeta accumulation in the Golgi and a concomitant reduction of Abeta in the multivesicular bodies. This indicates that Atg7 influences the transport of Abeta possibly derived from Golgi to multivesicular bodies.",

    "title": "Low concentrations of ethanol protect against synaptotoxicity induced by Abeta in hippocampal neurons.",
    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have reported a reduction in the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in individuals that ingest low amounts of alcohol. Also, it has been found that moderate consumption of ethanol might protect against beta-amyloid (Abeta) toxicity. However, the mechanism underlying its potential neuroprotection is largely unknown. In the present study, we found that ethanol improved the cognitive processes of learning and memory in 3xTgAD mice. In addition, we found that a low concentration of ethanol (equivalent to moderate ethanol consumption) decreased the binding of Abeta (1 and 5 muM) to neuronal membranes and, consequently, its synaptotoxic effect in rat hippocampal and cortical neurons under acute (30 minutes) and chronic (24 hours) incubation conditions. This effect appears to be exerted by a direct action of ethanol on Abeta because electron microscopy studies showed that ethanol altered the degree of Abeta aggregation. The action of ethanol on Abeta also prevented the peptide from perforating the neuronal membrane, as assayed with patch clamp experiments. Taken together, these results contribute to elucidating the mechanism by which low concentrations of ethanol protect against toxicity induced by Abeta oligomers in primary neuronal cultures. These results may also provide an explanation for the decrease in the risk of Alzheimer's disease in people who consume moderate doses of alcohol.",

The objectives of this study were to investigate whether HPA-axis dysregulation occurs at early clinical stages of AD and whether plasma and CSF cortisol levels are associated with clinical disease progression. Morning plasma and CSF cortisol concentrations were obtained from the subjects with AD dementia, mild cognitive impairment of AD type (MCI-AD), MCI of other type (MCI-O), and controls with normal cognition included in a multicenter study from the German Dementia Competence Network. A clinical and neuropsychological follow-up was performed in a subgroup of participants with MCI-AD, MCI-O, and AD dementia. CSF cortisol concentrations were increased in the subjects with AD dementia or MCI-AD compared with subjects with MCI-O or normal cognition. After controlling for possible confounders including CSF measures of amyloid beta1-42 and total tau, higher baseline CSF cortisol levels were associated with faster clinical worsening and cognitive decline in MCI-AD. The findings suggest that HPA-axis dysregulation occurs at the MCI stage of AD and may accelerate disease progression and cognitive decline.",

The levels of exosome-associated Abeta notably decreased in the CSF of aging animals. We also determined that neuronal exosomes, but not glial exosomes, had abundant glycosphingolipids and could capture Abeta. Infusion of neuronal exosomes into brains of APP transgenic mice decreased Abeta and amyloid depositions, similarly to what reported previously on neuroblastoma-derived exosomes.

In some cases this is as trivial as the choice of units, in some cases it is scanner dependent, and of course, different tracers yield different numbers. Our working group was formed to standardize quantitative amyloid imaging measures by scaling the outcome of each particular analysis method or tracer to a 0 to 100 scale, anchored by young controls (<= 45 years) and typical Alzheimer's disease patients. The units of this scale have been named \"Centiloids.\" Basically, we describe a \"standard\" method of analyzing PiB PET data and then a method for scaling any \"nonstandard\" method of PiB PET analysis (or any other tracer) to the Centiloid scale.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with damage to hippocampal neurons and declines in cognitive functions. The accumulation of amyloid peptides is regarded as a crucial event in the initiation of AD. The neurotoxicity induced by Abeta25-35 peptides was used to screen for cytoprotective factors in vitro, and the cognitive deficits induced by the injection of Abeta25-35 into the hippocampus were used to evaluate effect on learning and memory. Our previous study revealed that hydrolysate of polygalasaponins (HPS) clearly improve the cognitive deficits induced by the injection of Abeta25-35 in mice, but the potential active constituent of HPS remains unclear. The purposes of this study were to separate and purify the secondary saponins of HPS, screen for neuroprotective effects of the constituents in vitro, and to evaluate the effect of cognition in vivo. Various chromatographic methods were used to separate and purify the HPS. The neuroprotective effects were examined in Abeta25-35-damage-induced PC12 cells. The protective effect of tenuifolin on the cognitive impairments induced by Abeta25-35 injection was assessed using the Morris water maze and step-through passive avoidance tests. Tenuifolin and fallaxsaponin A were isolated from the HPS. Tenuifolin possessed neuroprotective effects against Abeta25-35-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells and significantly improved the cognitive deficits induced by the intrahippocampal injection of Abeta25-35 in mice. Thus, tenuifolin is one of the active constituents of HPS against the neurotoxicity induced by Abeta25-35 peptides in vitro and in vivo.",

It is characterized by an accelerated memory loss, and alterations of mood, reason, judgment and language. The main neuropathological hallmarks of the disorder are beta-amyloid (betaA) plaques and neurofibrillary Tau tangles. The triple transgenic 3xTgAD mouse model develops betaA and Tau pathologies in a progressive manner which mimicks the pattern that takes place in the human brain with AD, and showing cognitive alterations characteristic of the disease. The present study intended to examine whether 3xTgAD mice of both sexes present cognitive, emotional and other behavioral alterations at the early age of 4 months, an age in which only some intraneuronal amyloid accumulation is found. Neonatal handling (H) is an early-life treatment known to produce profound and long-lasting behavioral and neurobiological effects in rodents, as well as improvements in cognitive functions. Therefore, we also aimed at evaluating the effects of H on the behavioral/cognitive profile of 4-month-old male and female 3xTgAD mice. The results indicate that, (1) 3xTgAD mice present spatial learning/memory deficits and emotional alterations already at the early age of 4 months, (2) there exists sexual dimorphism effects on several behavioral variables at this age, (3) neonatal handling exerts a preventive effect on some cognitive (spatial learning) and emotional alterations appearing in 3xTgAD mice already at early ages, and 4) H treatment appears to produce stronger positive effects in females than in males in several spatial learning measures and in the open field test.",

    "title": "B2 receptor blockage prevents Abeta-induced cognitive impairment by neuroinflammation inhibition.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Abeta-induced neuronal toxicity and memory loss is thought to be dependent on neuroinflammation, an important event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, we demonstrated that the blockage of the kinin B2 receptor (B2R) protects against the memory deficits induced by amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide in mice. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of B2R on Abeta-induced neuroinflammation in mice and the beneficial effects of B2R blockage in synapses alterations. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The selective kinin B2R antagonist HOE 140 (50 pmol/site) was given by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) route to male Swiss mice 2 h prior the i.c.v. injection of Abeta(1-40) (400 pmol/site) peptide. Animals were sacrificed, at specific time points after Abeta(1-40) injection (6 h, 1 day or 8 days), and the brain was collected in order to perform immunohistochemical analysis. Different groups of animals were submitted to behavioral cognition tests on day 14 after Abeta(1-40) administration. KEY RESULTS: In this study, we report that the pre-treatment with the selective kinin B2R antagonist HOE 140 significantly inhibited Abeta-induced neuroinflammation in mice. B2R antagonism reduced microglial activation and the levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, including COX-2, iNOS and nNOS. Notably, these phenomena were accompanied by an inhibition of MAPKs (JNK and p38) and transcription factors (c-Jun and p65/NF-kappaB) activation. Finally, the anti-inflammatory effects of B2R antagonism provided significant protection against Abeta(1-40)-induced synaptic loss and cognitive impairment in mice. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Collectively, these results suggest that B2R activation may play a critical role in Abeta-induced neuroinflammation, one of the most important contributors to AD progression, and its blockage can provide synapses protection.",

    "abstract": "Impairments in working memory (WM) can predict the shift from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the rate at which AD progresses with age. The 3xTg-AD mouse model develops both Abeta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the neuro-pathological hallmarks of AD, by 6 months of age, but no research has investigated the age-related changes in WM in these mice. Using a cross-sectional design, we tested male and female 3xTg-AD and wildtype control (B6129SF2/J) mice between 2 and 15 months of age for reference and working memory errors in the 8-arm radial maze. The 3xTg-AD mice had deficits in both working and reference memory across the ages tested, rather than showing the predicted age-related memory deficits. Male 3xTg-AD mice showed more working and reference memory errors than females, but there were no sex differences in wildtype control mice. These results indicate that the 3xTg-AD mouse replicates the impairments in WM found in patients with AD. However, these mice show memory deficits as early as two months of age, suggesting that the genes underlying reference and working memory in these mice cause deficits from an early age. The finding that males were affected more than females suggests that more attention should be paid to sex differences in transgenic AD mice.",

    "abstract": "Numerous aromatic small molecule modulators of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) monomer aggregation and neurotoxicity have been identified with the ultimate goal of Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. Determining binding sites of these modulators on Abeta monomer is an important topic in the mechanistic understanding of AD pathology and drug development. However, Abeta monomer binding sites have been reported for only a very limited number of Abeta modulators. In this article, we present a convenient method for determining aggregation-modulating polycyclic aromatic small molecule ligand binding sites on Abeta monomer using immunostaining with a panel of Abeta sequence-specific antibodies. To validate our technique, we first examined one modulating aromatic ligand, Congo Red, with known binding sites, which yielded consistent results with previous findings. Then, using the same technique, binding sites on Abeta of four known Abeta monomer aggregation modulators, Erythrosin B, Eosin Y, Phloxine B, and Rose Bengal, were determined. The identified ligand binding sites were also confirmed by a separate fluorescence quenching-based assay using a panel of overlapping Abeta sub-fragments. The technique described here greatly increases researchers' ability to determine the Abeta monomer binding site(s) of aggregation-modulating aromatic small molecule ligands and to screen for new ligands that bind specific regions on Abeta.",

Causes and mechanisms of these diseases remain elusive. Neuroinflammation is increasingly emerging as an important pathological factor in their development. Positron emission tomography (PET) using [11C]PK11195 represents a method of visualizing the microglial component of neuroinflammation via the translocator protein (TSPO) and we discuss the valuable insights this has yielded in neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss the limitations of this method and the development of second generation TSPO PET ligands which hope to overcome these limitations. We also discuss other methods of visualizing neuroinflammation and review the state of current dementia treatments targeted at neuroinflammation. It is our view that a multimodal investigation into neuroinflammation in AD, Parkinson's disease dementia, FTD and HD will yield valuable pathological insights which will usefully inform development of therapeutic targets and biomarkers.",

A case-control association analysis was used. Clinical data and peripheral blood were collected from 201 Alzheimer's disease patients and 257 healthy controls. PCR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry detection technologies were used to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distribution at SORL1 gene loci. Genotype and allele frequency differences were analyzed and compared between groups. No significant differences were found in genotype frequency distributions of the rs689021 and rs3824966 loci. Similarly, allele frequency distributions of the C and T alleles of rs689021, and the C and G alleles of rs3824966 showed no significant differences. However, the genotype frequency distribution of the rs1784933 locus was significantly different, and the allele frequency distribution of the A and G alleles were also significantly different. Multifactor logistic regression analysis showed that after correcting for confounding factors such as gender, age, and cholesterol, LOAD risk in rs1784933 AA genotype carriers was 1.803 times that in AG+GG genotype carriers. SORL1 gene SNPs at rs689021 and rs3824966 loci show no relationship with LOAD onset in the Chinese Han population of the Hunan Changsha region. Conversely, a SORL1 gene SNP at the rs1784933 locus is associated with LOAD onset, with the A allele being a risk factor.",

Abeta oligomers block the induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in rodents. The activation of Wnt signaling prevents Abeta oligomer-induced neurotoxic effects. The compound WASP-1 (Wnt-activating small molecule potentiator-1), has been described as a synergist of the ligand Wnt-3a, enhancing the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Herein, we report that WASP-1 administration successfully rescued Abeta-induced synaptic impairments both in vitro and in vivo. The activation of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by WASP-1 increased synaptic transmission and rescued hippocampal LTP impairments induced by Abeta oligomers. Additionally, intra-hippocampal administration of WASP-1 to the double transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of AD prevented synaptic protein loss and reduced tau phosphorylation levels. Moreover, we found that WASP-1 blocked Abeta aggregation in vitro and reduced pathological tau phosphorylation in vivo. These results indicate that targeting canonical Wnt signaling with WASP-1 could have value for treating AD.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides correlates with aging and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta peptides, which cause early synaptic dysfunctions, spine loss, and memory deficits, also disturb intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. By cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) measurements, we here define the short-term effects of synthetic Abeta42 on neuronal Ca(2+) dynamics. When applied acutely at submicromolar concentration, as either oligomers or monomers, Abeta42 did not cause Ca(2+) release or Ca(2+) influx. Similarly, 1-hour treatment with Abeta42 modified neither the resting cytosolic Ca(2+) level nor the long-lasting Ca(2+) influx caused by KCl-induced depolarization. In contrast, Abeta42 oligomers, but not monomers, significantly altered Ca(2+) release from stores with opposite effects on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)- and caffeine-induced Ca(2+) mobilization without alteration of the total store Ca(2+) content. Ca(2+) dysregulation by Abeta42 oligomers involves metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 and requires network activity and the intact exo-endocytotic machinery, being prevented by tetrodotoxin and tetanus toxin. These findings support the idea that Ca(2+) store dysfunction is directly involved in Abeta42 neurotoxicity and represents a potential therapeutic target in AD-like dementia.",

Measurement of subtle changes in amyloid burden requires quantitative analysis of image data. Reliable quantitative analysis of amyloid PET scans acquired at multiple sites and over time requires rigorous standardization of acquisition protocols, subject management, tracer administration, image quality control, and image processing and analysis methods. We review critical points in the acquisition and analysis of amyloid PET, identify ways in which technical factors can contribute to measurement variability, and suggest methods for mitigating these sources of noise. Improved quantitative accuracy could reduce the sample size necessary to detect intervention effects when amyloid PET is used as a treatment end point and allow more reliable interpretation of change in amyloid burden and its relationship to clinical course.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by extensive deposition of fibrillar amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain. Previously, myelin basic protein (MBP) was identified to be a potent inhibitor to Abeta fibril formation, and this inhibitory activity was localized to the N-terminal residues 1-64, a fragment designated MBP1. Here, we show that the modest neuronal expression of a fusion protein of the biologically active MBP1 fragment and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (MBP1-EGFP) significantly improved the performance of spatial learning memory in Tg-5xFAD mice, a model of pathologic Abeta accumulation in brain. The levels of insoluble Abeta and fibrillar amyloid were significantly reduced in bigenic Tg-5xFAD/Tg-MBP1-EGFP mice. Quantitative stereological analysis revealed that the reduction in amyloid was because of a reduction in the size of fibrillar plaques rather than a decrease in plaque numbers. The current findings support previous studies showing that MBP1 inhibits Abeta fibril formation in vitro and demonstrate the ability of MBP1 to reduce Abeta pathology and improve behavioral performance.",

Basic fibroblast growth factor or fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) is an anti-inflammatory, angiogenic, and neurotrophic factor that is expressed in many cell types, including neurons and glial cells. Here, we explored whether subcutaneous administration of FGF2 could have therapeutic effects in the APP 23 transgenic mouse, a model of amyloid pathology. FGF2 treatment attenuated spatial memory deficits, reduced amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau pathologies, decreased inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and increased the number of astrocytes in the dentate gyrus in APP 23 mice compared with the vehicle-treated controls. The decrease in Abeta deposition was associated with a reduction in the expression of BACE1, the main enzyme responsible for Abeta generation. These results were confirmed in a neuroblastoma cell line, which demonstrated that incubation with FGF2 regulates BACE1 transcription. In addition, and in contrast with what has been previously published, the levels of FGF2 were reduced in postmortem brains from AD patients compared with controls. These data, therefore, suggest that systemic administration of FGF2 could have a potential therapeutic application in AD.",

The suppression (or alteration) of Abeta aggregation is considered to be an attractive therapeutic intervention for treating AD. We report on visible light-induced inhibition of Abeta aggregation by xanthene dyes, which are widely used as biomolecule tracers and imaging markers for live cells. Among many xanthene dyes, rose bengal (RB) under green LED illumination exhibited a much stronger inhibition effect upon photo-excitation on Abeta aggregation than RB under dark conditions. We found that RB possesses high binding affinity to Abeta; it exhibits a remarkable red shift and a strong enhancement of fluorescence emission in the presence of Abeta. Photo-excited RB interfered with an early step in the pathway of Abeta self-assembly and suppressed the conformational transition of Abeta monomers into beta-sheet-rich structures. Photo-excited RB is not only effective in the inhibition of Abeta aggregation, but also in the reduction of Abeta-induced cytotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "AIM: To detect the beta-amyloid plaques (Abeta) in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles coated with 1,1-dicyano-2-[6-(dimethylamino)-naphthalene-2-yl] propene carboxyl derivative (DDNP-SPIO). MATERIALS AND METHODS: DDNP-SPIO was prepared in a previous trial. The binding affinity of DDNP-SPIO to Abeta was tested using fluorescence spectrophotometry in vitro. In vivo, five AD rats and five non-AD rats were intravenously injected with DDNP-SPIO at a dose of 76 mumol Fe/kg. Coronal T2*-weighted images were collected at baseline and repeated at 10, 30, and 60 min post-injection. Enhancement features of the two groups were analysed. After imaging, brain specimens were resected for Congo red and Prussian blue staining to assess the binding of DDNP-SPIO to Abeta deposits. RESULTS: In vitro experiments indicated that the DDNP-SPIO nanoparticles displayed high binding affinities towards Abeta with a Kd value of 29.4 nmol/l. A significant decrease in SI was detected in the hippocampal area of AD rats after intravenous injection of the nanoparticles, but not in non-AD rats. The measurement of the percentage signal loss decreased to 52% in AD rats. In non-AD rats, only 10% signal loss was observed. There was a significant difference between the two groups (t = 4.533, p < 0.05). The signal decrease resulted from the binding of the DDNP-SPIO nanoparticles to the Abeta plaques, which was identified with Congo red and Prussian blue staining. CONCLUSION: The DDNP-SPIO nanoparticles could potentially be used for visualizing Abeta plaques, which may be helpful for diagnosing the early stages of AD and monitoring the effects of drug therapy.",

In this study, we investigated regional metabolic alterations in brain from the APP/PS1 mice, a transgenic model that reproduces well some of the neuropathological and cognitive deficits observed in human Alzheimer's disease. For this purpose, hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum and olfactory bulbs were analyzed using a high-throughput metabolomic approach based on direct infusion mass spectrometry. Metabolic fingerprints showed significant differences between transgenic and wild-type mice in all brain tissues, being hippocampus and cortex the most affected regions. Alterations in numerous metabolites were detected including phospholipids, fatty acids, purine and pyrimidine metabolites, acylcarnitines, sterols and amino acids, among others. Furthermore, metabolic pathway analysis revealed important alterations in homeostasis of lipids, energy management, and metabolism of amino acids and nucleotides. Therefore, these findings demonstrate the potential of metabolomic screening and the use of transgenic models for understanding pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.",

Their structure-activity relationships were obtained and discussed. In particular, compound 4b1, the most active compound, displayed strong inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 9.7 muM for self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation, good antioxidative activity with a value of 3.9-fold of Trolox, potent inhibitory activity for cholinesterase with IC50 values of 0.2 muM and 64.1 muM against butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), respectively. Besides, 4b1 was also capable of disassembling the self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation fibrils with a ratio of 59.8% at 20 muM concentration, and had a good metal chelating activity.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Tailoring perioperative management to minimize the postoperative complication rates depends on reliable prognostication of patients most at risk. The Surgical Apgar Score is an objective measure of the operative course validated to predict major complications and death after general/vascular surgery. We assessed the ability of the Surgical Apgar Score to identify patients most at risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality after renal mass excision. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data for 886 patients undergoing renal mass excision via radical or partial nephrectomy from 2010 to 2013 were extracted from a prospectively collected database. The Surgical Apgar Score was calculated using electronic anesthesia records. Major postoperative complications, readmission and reoperation within 30 days of surgery as well as 90-day mortality were examined. RESULTS: Overall 13.2% of patients experienced major postoperative complications at 30 days. Clavien grade I, II, III, IV and V complications were experienced by 1.7%, 2.9%, 5.8%, 1.9% and 0.9%, respectively. The 90-day all cause mortality rate was 1.4%. The Surgical Apgar Score was significantly lower in patients experiencing major complications (mean 7.3 vs 7.8, p=0.004) and death (6.3 vs 7.7, p=0.03). Patients with a Surgical Apgar Score of 4 or less were 3.7 times more likely to experience a major complication (p=0.01) and 24 times more likely to die within 90 days of surgery (p=0.0007) compared to patients with a Surgical Apgar Score greater than 8. CONCLUSIONS: The Surgical Apgar Score is an easily collected metric that can identify patients at higher risk for major complications and death after renal mass excision. A prospective trial to help further delineate the optimal use of this tool in an adjusted perioperative management approach with patients undergoing renal mass excision is warranted.",

    "title": "Plasma levels of apolipoprotein E and risk of dementia in the general population.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease and dementia. However, it remains unclear whether plasma levels of apoE confer additional risk. We tested this hypothesis. METHODS: Using 75,708 participants from the general population, we tested whether low plasma levels of apoE at study enrollment were associated with increased risk of future Alzheimer disease and all dementia, and whether this association was independent of epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4 APOE genotype. RESULTS: Multifactorially adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for Alzheimer disease and all dementia increased from the highest to the lowest apoE tertile (p for trends < 1 x 10(-6) ). Multifactorially adjusted HRs for lowest versus highest tertile were 2.68 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.04-3.52) and 1.80 (95% CI = 1.52-2.13) for Alzheimer disease and all dementia, respectively. After further adjustment for epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4 APOE genotype, plasma apoE tertiles remained associated with Alzheimer disease (p for trend = 0.007) and all dementia (p for trend = 0.04). Plasma apoE tertiles did not interact with epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4 APOE genotype on risk of Alzheimer disease (p = 0.53) or all dementia (p = 0.79). In a subanalysis, the -219G>T GT promoter genotype, associated with low plasma apoE levels, remained significantly associated with increased risk of Alzheimer disease after adjustment for epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4 APOE genotype (HR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.05-2.30). INTERPRETATION: Low plasma levels of apoE are associated with increased risk of future Alzheimer disease and all dementia in the general population, independent of epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4 APOE genotype. This is clinically relevant, because no plasma biomarkers are currently implemented. Hence, plasma levels of apoE may be a new, easily accessible preclinical biomarker.",

Compact oligomeric species, observed early during amyloid formation, are reported as the molecular entities responsible for the toxic effects of amyloid self-assembly. However, the relation between early-stage oligomeric aggregates and late-stage rigid fibrils, which are the hallmark structure of amyloid plaques, has remained unclear. We show that these different structures occupy well-defined regions in a peculiar phase diagram. Lysozyme amyloid oligomers and their curvilinear fibrils only form after they cross a salt and protein concentration-dependent threshold. We also determine a boundary for the onset of amyloid oligomer precipitation. The oligomeric aggregates are structurally distinct from rigid fibrils and are metastable against nucleation and growth of rigid fibrils. These experimentally determined boundaries match well with colloidal model predictions that account for salt-modulated charge repulsion. The model also incorporates the metastable and kinetic character of oligomer phases. Similarities and differences of amyloid oligomer assembly to metastable liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins and to surfactant aggregation are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal accumulation of soluble amyloid beta (Abeta) is believed to cause malfunction of neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hippocampus is one of the earliest affected brain regions in AD. However, little effort has been made to investigate the effects of soluble Abeta1-42 oligomers on discharge properties of hippocampal neurons in vivo. This study was designed to examine the effects of soluble Abeta1-42 oligomers on the discharge properties of hippocampal CA1 neurons using extracellular single-unit recordings in vivo. The protective effects of riluzole (RLZ) were also investigated for the prevention of soluble oligomers of Abeta1-42-induced alterations in the spontaneous discharge of hippocampal neurons. The results showed that (1) the mean frequency of spontaneous discharge was increased by the local application of 100 muM Abeta1-42 oligomers; (2) Abeta1-42 oligomers also induced alterations of the neuronal firing patterns in the hippocampal CA1 region; and (3) pretreatment with 20 muM RLZ effectively inhibited the Abeta1-42-induced enhancement of spontaneous discharge and alterations of neuronal firing patterns in CA1 neurons. Our study suggested that Abeta1-42 oligomers induced hyperactivity and perturbed the firing patterns in hippocampal neurons. RLZ may provide neuroprotective effects on the Abeta1-42-induced perturbation of neuronal activities in the hippocampal region of rats.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and has no effective treatment. Besides the well-known pathologic characteristics, this disease also has a vascular component, and substantial evidence shows increased thrombosis as well as a critical role for fibrin(ogen) in AD. This molecule has been implicated in neuroinflammation, neurovascular damage, blood-brain barrier permeability, vascular amyloid deposition, and memory deficits that are observed in AD. Here, we present evidence demonstrating that fibrin deposition increases in the AD brain and correlates with the degree of pathology. Moreover, we show that fibrin(ogen) is present in areas of dystrophic neurites and that a modest decrease in fibrinogen levels improves neuronal health and ameliorates amyloid pathology in the subiculum of AD mice. Our results further characterize the important role of fibrin(ogen) in this disease and support the design of therapeutic strategies aimed at blocking the interaction between fibrinogen and amyloid-beta (Abeta) and/or normalizing the increased thrombosis present in AD.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Noninvasive determination of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposition has important significance for early diagnosis and medical intervention for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we investigated the availability of radiolabeled DRM106 ((123/125)I-DRM106 [6-iodo-2-[4-(1H-3-pyrazolyl)phenyl]imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine]), a compound with sufficient affinity for the synthesis of human Abeta fibrils and satisfactory metabolic stability, as a SPECT ligand in living brains. METHOD: The sensitivity of (125)I-DRM106 for detecting Abeta deposition was compared with that of (125)I-IMPY (2-(4'-dimethylaminophenyl)-6-iodo-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine), a well-known amyloid SPECT ligand, by ex vivo autoradiographic analyses in 18-mo-old amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. To verify the sensitivity and quantitation of radiolabeled DRM106 for in vivo imaging, we compared the detectability of Abeta plaques with (123)I-DRM106 and a well-known amyloid PET agent, (11)C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PiB), in 29-mo-old transgenic mice and age-matched nontransgenic littermates. Additionally, we compared the binding characteristics of (125)I-DRM106 with those of (11)C-PiB and (11)C-PBB3, which selectively bind to Abeta plaques and preferentially to tau aggregates, respectively, in postmortem AD brain sections. RESULTS: Ex vivo autoradiographic analysis showed that measurement with (125)I-DRM106 has a higher sensitivity for detecting Abeta accumulation than with (125)I-IMPY in transgenic mice. SPECT imaging with (123)I-DRM106 also successfully detected Abeta deposition in living aged transgenic mice and showed strong correlation (R = 0.95, P < 0.01) in quantitative analysis for Abeta plaque detection by PET imaging with (11)C-PiB, implying that sensitivity and quantitation of SPECT imaging with (123)I-DRM106 are almost as good as (11)C-PiB PET for the detectability of Abeta deposition. Further, the addition of nonradiolabeled DRM106 fully blocked the binding of (125)I-DRM106 and (11)C-PiB, but not (11)C-PBB3, to AD brain sections, and (125)I-DRM106 showed a lower binding ratio of the diffuse plaque-rich lateral temporal cortex to the dense-cored/neuritic plaque-rich hippocampal CA1 area, compared with (11)C-PiB. CONCLUSION: All of these data demonstrated the high potential of (123)I-DRM106 for amyloid imaging in preclinical and clinical application, and it might more preferentially detect dense-cored/neuritic amyloid deposition, which is expected to be closely associated with neuropathologic changes of AD.",

    "abstract": "The formation of senile plaques composed of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brain is likely the initial event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Possession of the APOE epsilon4 allele, the strong genetic factor for AD, facilitates the Abeta deposition from the presymptomatic stage of AD in a gene-dosage-dependent manner. However, the precise mechanism by which apoE isoforms differentially induce the AD pathology is largely unknown. LR11/SorLA is a type I membrane protein that functions as the neuronal lipoprotein endocytic receptor of apoE and the sorting receptor of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to regulate amyloidogenesis. Recently, LR11/SorLA has been reported to be involved in the lysosomal targeting of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) through the binding of Abeta to the vacuolar protein sorting 10 (VPS10) protein domain of LR11/SorLA. Here, we attempted to examine the human-apoE-isoform-dependent effect on the cellular uptake of Abeta through the formation of a complex between an apoE isoform and LR11/SorLA. Cell culture experiments using Neuro2a cells revealed that the cellular uptake of secreted apoE3 and apoE4 was enhanced by the overexpression of LR11/SorLA. In contrast, the cellular uptake of apoE2 was not affected by the expression of LR11/SorLA. Co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed that apoE-isoform-dependent differences were observed in the formation of an apoE-LR11 complex (apoE4>apoE3>apoE2). ApoE-isoform-dependent differences in cellular uptake of FAM-labeled Abeta were further investigated by coculture assay in which donor cells secrete one of the apoE isoforms and recipient cells express FL-LR11. The cellular uptake of extracellular Abeta into the recipient cells was most prominently accentuated when cocultured with the donor cells secreting apoE4 in the medium, followed by apoE3 and apoE2. Taken together, our results provide evidence for the mechanism whereby human-apoE-isoform-dependent differences modulate the cellular uptake of Abeta mediated by LR11/SorLA.",

    "abstract": "GluN2B subunit containing NMDARs (GluN2B-NMDARs) mediate pathophysiological effects of acutely applied amyloid beta (Abeta), including impaired long-term potentiation (LTP). However, in transgenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models which feature gradual Abeta accumulation, the function of GluN2B-NMDARs and their contribution to synaptic plasticity are unknown. Therefore, we examined the role of GluN2B-NMDARs in synaptic function and plasticity in the hippocampus of PS2APP transgenic mice. Although LTP induced by theta burst stimulation (TBS) was normal in PS2APP mice, it was significantly reduced by the selective GluN2B-NMDAR antagonist Ro25-6981 (Ro25) in PS2APP mice, but not wild type (wt) mice. While NMDARs activated by single synaptic stimuli were not blocked by Ro25, NMDARs recruited during burst stimulation showed larger blockade by Ro25 in PS2APP mice. Thus, the unusual dependence of LTP on GluN2B-NMDARs in PS2APP mice suggests that non-synaptic GluN2B-NMDARs are activated by glutamate that spills out of synaptic cleft during the burst stimulation used to induce LTP. While long-term depression (LTD) was normal in PS2APP mice, and Ro25 had no impact on LTD in wt mice, Ro25 impaired LTD in PS2APP mice, again demonstrating aberrant GluN2B-NMDAR function during plasticity. Together these results demonstrate altered GluN2B-NMDAR function in a model of early AD pathology that has implications for the therapeutic targeting of NMDARs in AD.",

    "abstract": "Microglia, the innate immune cells of the CNS, perform critical inflammatory and noninflammatory functions that maintain normal neural function. For example, microglia clear misfolded proteins, elaborate trophic factors, and regulate and terminate toxic inflammation. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, beneficial microglial functions become impaired, accelerating synaptic and neuronal loss. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to microglial dysfunction is an important objective for identifying potential strategies to delay progression to AD. The inflammatory cyclooxygenase/prostaglandin E2 (COX/PGE2) pathway has been implicated in preclinical AD development, both in human epidemiology studies and in transgenic rodent models of AD. Here, we evaluated murine models that recapitulate microglial responses to Abeta peptides and determined that microglia-specific deletion of the gene encoding the PGE2 receptor EP2 restores microglial chemotaxis and Abeta clearance, suppresses toxic inflammation, increases cytoprotective insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling, and prevents synaptic injury and memory deficits. Our findings indicate that EP2 signaling suppresses beneficial microglia functions that falter during AD development and suggest that inhibition of the COX/PGE2/EP2 immune pathway has potential as a strategy to restore healthy microglial function and prevent progression to AD.",

We show that a large delocalization of the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital in these charge-transfer compounds enhances the rate of radiative decay considerably by inducing a large oscillator strength even when there is a small overlap between the two wavefunctions. A compound based on our design principles exhibited a high rate of fluorescence decay and efficient up-conversion of triplet excitons into singlet excited states, leading to both photoluminescence and internal electroluminescence quantum yields of nearly 100%.",

    "title": "Analysis of motor function in 6-month-old male and female 3xTg-AD mice.",
    "abstract": "The 3xTg-AD mouse has high validity as a model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) because it develops both amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Human patients with AD typically develop motor deficits, which worsen as the disease progresses, but 3xTg-AD mice have been reported to show enhanced motor abilities. We investigated the motor behaviour phenotype of male and female 3xTg-AD and B6129SF2 wildtype mice on a battery of motor behaviours at 6 months of age. Compared to wildtype mice, the 3xTg-AD mice had enhanced motor performance on the Rotarod, but worse performance on the grid suspension task. In gait analysis 3xTg-AD mice had a longer stride length and made more foot slips on the balance beam than wildtype mice. There was no overall difference in voluntary wheel-running activity between genotypes, but there was a disruption in circadian activity rhythm in 3xTg-AD mice. In some motor tasks, such as the Rotarod and balance beam, females appeared to perform better than males, but this sex differences was accounted for by differences in body weight. Our results indicate that while the 3xTg-AD mice show enhanced performance on the Rotarod, they have poorer performance on other motor behaviour tasks, indicating that their motor behaviour phenotype is more complex than previously reported. The presence of the P301L transgene may explain the enhancement of Rotarod performance but the poorer performance on other motor behaviour tasks may be due to other transgenes.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: Active amyloid-beta (Abeta) immunotherapy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) induces removal of Abeta and phosphorylated tau (ptau). Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta is a kinase, responsible for phosphorylation of tau, activation of which can be induced by phosphorylated double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (pPKR). Using a post-mortem cohort of immunized AD cases, we investigated the effect of Abeta immunization on GSK-3beta expression and pPKR. METHODS: We immunostained 11 immunized AD cases and 28 unimmunized AD cases for active, inactive and total GSK-3beta, and for pPKR. Quantification of protein load was performed in the hippocampal region including CA1, subiculum and entorhinal cortex. RESULTS: All three areas showed a significant decrease in the three forms of GSK-3beta (P < 0.05) and a nonsignificant trend towards lower pPKR load in the immunized AD cases compared with the unimmunized AD cases. CONCLUSION: The lower GSK-3beta expression generated by Abeta immunotherapy shows evidence of a modification of the signalling pathway induced by GSK-3beta leading to the overall reduction of tau, supporting the contention that in humans, GSK-3beta unifies Abeta and tau-related neuropathology.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: Levels of the cyclic nucleotides guanosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cGMP) or adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) that play important roles in memory processes are not characterized in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to analyse the levels of these nucleotides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients diagnosed with clinical and prodromal stages of AD and study the expression level of the enzymes that hydrolyzed them [phosphodiesterases (PDEs)] in the brain of AD patients vs. METHODS: For cGMP and cAMP CSF analysis, the cohort (n = 79) included cognitively normal participants (subjective cognitive impairment), individuals with stable mild cognitive impairment or AD converters (sMCI and cMCI), and mild AD patients. A high throughput liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was used. Interactions between CSF cGMP or cAMP with mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score, CSF Abeta(1-42) and CSF p-tau were analysed. For PDE4, 5, 9 and 10 expression analysis, brains of AD patients vs. controls (n = 7 and n = 8) were used. RESULTS: cGMP, and not cAMP levels, were significantly lower in the CSF of patients diagnosed with mild AD when compared with nondemented controls. CSF levels of cGMP showed a significant association with MMSE-diagnosed clinical dementia and with CSF biomarker Abeta42 in AD patients. Significant increase in PDE5 expression was detected in temporal cortex of AD patients compared with that of age-matched healthy control subjects. No changes in the expression of others PDEs were detected. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the potential involvement of cGMP in the pathological and clinical development of AD. The cGMP reduction in early stages of AD might participate in the aggravation of amyloid pathology and cognitive decline.",

First reported in animal models, it remains uncertain if peripheral inflammatory and/or infectious conditions in humans can promote Abeta brain accumulation. Periodontal disease, a common chronic infection, has been previously reported to be associated with AD. Thirty-eight cognitively normal, healthy, and community-residing elderly (mean age, 61 and 68% female) were examined in an Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and a University-Based Dental School. Linear regression models (adjusted for age, apolipoprotein E, and smoking) were used to test the hypothesis that periodontal disease assessed by clinical attachment loss was associated with brain Abeta load using (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography imaging. After adjusting for confounders, clinical attachment loss (>=3 mm), representing a history of periodontal inflammatory/infectious burden, was associated with increased PIB uptake in Abeta vulnerable brain regions (p = 0.002). We show for the first time in humans an association between periodontal disease and brain Abeta load. These data are consistent with the previous animal studies showing that peripheral inflammation/infections are sufficient to produce brain Abeta accumulations.",

    "title": "Tau aggregation and its interplay with amyloid-beta.",
    "abstract": "Neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques constitute the hallmark brain lesions of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Tangles are composed of fibrillar aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau, and plaques comprise fibrillar forms of a proteolytic cleavage product, amyloid-beta (Abeta). Although plaques and tangles are the end-stage lesions in AD, small oligomers of Abeta and tau are now receiving increased attention as they are shown to correlate best with neurotoxicity. One key question of debate, however, is which of these pathologies appears first and hence is upstream in the pathocascade. Studies suggest that there is an intense crosstalk between the two molecules and, based on work in animal models, there is increasing evidence that Abeta, at least in part, exerts its toxicity via tau, with the Src kinase Fyn playing a crucial role in this process. In other experimental paradigms, Abeta and tau have been found to exert both separate and synergistic modes of toxicity. The challenge, however, is to integrate these different scenarios into a coherent picture. Furthermore, the ability of therapeutic interventions targeting just one of these molecules, to successfully neutralize the toxicity of the other, needs to be ascertained to improve current therapeutic strategies, such as immunotherapy, for the treatment of AD. Although this article is not intended to provide a comprehensive review of the currently pursued therapeutic strategies, we will discuss what has been achieved by immunotherapy and, in particular, how the inherent limitations of this approach can possibly be overcome by novel strategies that involve single-chain antibodies.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular conditions are common in old age and are associated with cognitive decline. However, considerable heterogeneity remains in residual decline (i.e., person-specific trajectories of cognitive decline adjusted for these common neuropathologic conditions). The present study aimed to characterize profiles of residual decline in late life cognition. METHOD: Up to 19 waves of longitudinal cognitive data were collected from 876 autopsied participants from 2 ongoing clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging. Uniform neuropathologic examinations quantified measures of Alzheimer's disease, cerebral infarcts, Lewy body disease, and hippocampal sclerosis. Random effects mixture models characterized latent profiles of residual decline in global cognition. RESULTS: We identified 4 latent groups, and each group demonstrated distinct residual decline profiles. On average, 44% of the participants had little or no decline, 35% showed moderate decline, 13% showed severe decline and the rest (8%) had substantial within-subject fluctuation of longitudinal cognitive measures. These latent groups differed in psychological, experiential and neurobiologic factors that have been previously shown to be associated with cognitive decline. Specifically, compared with nondecliners, decliners had more depressive symptoms, were more socially isolated; were less engaged in cognitive or physical activities; and had lower density of noradrenergic neurons in locus ceruleus. CONCLUSIONS: After controlling for common dementia related pathologies, considerable residual variability remains in cognitive aging trajectories and this variability is not random but rather is related to markers of cognitive and neural reserve. The mixture modeling approach provides a powerful tool to identify latent groups with distinct cognitive trajectories.",

As AD patients show increased serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) levels, we examined the effect of TNFalpha on the function and expression of Abeta transport-related proteins including cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) in the mouse brain microvascular endothelial cell line MBEC4. TNFalpha decreased PrP(C) levels and intracellular radiolabeled Abeta. Similarly, anti-prion protein antibody also decreased radiolabeled Abeta. These results suggest that TNFalpha lowers PrP(C) levels, which in turn, reduces Abeta in the brain endothelium.",

    "title": "Survival outcome of stage I ovarian clear cell carcinoma with lympho-vascular space invasion.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The clinical impact of lympho-vascular space invasion (LVSI) in early-stage ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is not well understood. Given the distinct tumor biology and survival patterns of OCCC, the significance of LVSI on survival outcome and treatment response was examined in OCCC. METHODS: A multicenter study was conducted to examine stage IA-IC3 OCCC cases that underwent primary surgical staging including lymphadenectomy. LVSI status was determined from archived histopathology slides, correlated with clinico-pathological results, chemotherapy patterns, and survival outcomes. RESULTS: LVSI was observed in 47 (20.3%) among 232 cases. In univariate analysis, LVSI was associated with older age (p=0.042), large tumor size (p=0.048), and stage IC (p=0.035). In survival analysis, LVSI was associated with decreased disease-free survival (DFS, 5-year rate, 70.6% versus 92.1%, p=0.0004) and overall survival (OS, 78.8% versus 93.3%, p=0.008) on univariate analysis. After controlling for age, tumor size, stage, and chemotherapy use, LVSI remained an independent prognostic factor for decreased survival outcomes (DFS, hazard ratio [HR] 4.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.73-10.9, p=0.002; and OS, HR 4.73, 95%CI 1.60-14.0, p=0.015). Among 210 cases who received postoperative chemotherapy, while regimen type did not impact survival outcome regardless of LVSI status (DFS, p=0.63), the number of administered cycles showed a survival benefit towards >=6cycles for patients with LVSI-positive tumors (DFS, p=0.009; and OS, p=0.016). CONCLUSION: LVSI is an important marker to predict survival outcome of stage I OCCC. Regardless of chemotherapy type, patients with stage I OCCC showing LVSI may benefit from receiving postoperative chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, and in particular Abeta42, are found in senile plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease. A compartmental model of Abeta production, exchange and irreversible loss was recently developed to explain the kinetics of isotope-labeling of Abeta peptides collected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) following infusion of stable isotope-labeled leucine in humans. The compartmental model allowed calculation of the rates of production, irreversible loss (or turnover) and short-term exchange of Abeta peptides. Exchange of Abeta42 was particularly pronounced in amyloid plaque-bearing participants. In the current work, we describe in much greater detail the characteristics of the compartmental model to two distinct audiences: physician-scientists and biokineticists. For physician-scientists, we describe through examples the types of questions the model can and cannot answer, as well as correct some misunderstandings of previous kinetic analyses applied to this type of isotope labeling data. For biokineticists, we perform a system identifiability analysis and a sensitivity analysis of the kinetic model to explore the global and local properties of the model. Combined, these analyses motivate simplifications from a more comprehensive physiological model to the final model that was previously presented. The analyses clearly demonstrate that the current dataset and compartmental model allow determination with confidence a single 'turnover' parameter, a single 'exchange' parameter and a single 'delay' parameter. When combined with CSF concentration data for the Abeta peptides, production rates may also be obtained.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of beta amyloid (Abeta) in the brain is believed to play a key role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Glycosaminoglycans on surface of neuronal cells can serve as nucleation sites to promote plaque formation on cell surface. To mimic this process, magnetic nanoparticles coated with heparin have been synthesized. The heparin nanoparticles were demonstrated to bind with Abeta through a variety of techniques including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, gel electrophoresis, and thioflavin T assay. The nanoparticle exhibited little toxicity to neuronal cells and at the same time can effectively protect them from Abeta induced cytotoxicity. These results suggest that heparin nanoparticles can be a very useful tool for Abeta studies.",

In this study, we investigated the protective effects of a polysaccharide (PS-WNP) from Polygonatum sibiricum against the Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells and explored the underlying mechanism. The results showed that pretreatment with PS-WNP significantly attenuated cell death and the elevated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio evoked by Abeta(25-35), and subsequently inhibited mitochondrial dysfunction and cytochrome c release into the cytosol. Moreover, PS-WNP significantly inhibited Abeta(25-35) induced caspase-3 activation and enhanced the protein levels of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) in PC12 cells. Additionally, pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) completely abolished the protective effects of PS-WNP against Abeta(25-35)-induced neuronal cell apoptosis. These observations unambiguously suggested that the protective effect of PS-WNP against Abeta(25-35)-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells was associated with the enhancement of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",

    "title": "The transitional association between beta-amyloid pathology and regional brain atrophy.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) associated with brain atrophy and cognitive decline. The functional form to model the association between Abeta and regional brain atrophy has not been well defined. To determine the relationship between Abeta and atrophy, we compared the performance of the usual dichotomization of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta to identify subjects as Abeta+ and Abeta- with a trilinear spline model of CSF Abeta. METHODS: One hundred and eighty-three subjects with mild cognitive impairment and 108 cognitively normal controls with baseline CSF Abeta and up to 4 years of longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were analyzed using mixed-effects regression. Piecewise-linear splines were used to evaluate the nonlinear nature of the association between CSF Abeta and regional atrophy and to identify points of acceleration of atrophy with respect to Abeta. Several parameterizations of CSF Abeta were compared using likelihood ratio tests and the Akaike information criterion. Periods of acceleration of atrophy in which subjects transition from CSF Abeta negativity to CSF Abeta positivity were estimated from the spline models and tested for significance. RESULTS: Spline models resulted in better fits for many temporal and parietal regions compared with the dichotomous models. The trilinear model showed that periods of acceleration of atrophy varied greatly by region with early changes seen in the insula, amygdala, precuneus, hippocampus, and other temporal regions, occurring before the clinical threshold for CSF Abeta positivity. DISCUSSION: The use of piecewise-linear splines provides an improved model of the nonlinear association between CSF Abeta and regional atrophy in regions implicated in the progression of AD. The important biological finding of this work is that some brain regions show periods of accelerated volume loss well before the CSF Abeta42 threshold. This implies that signs of brain atrophy develop before the current conventional definition of \"preclinical AD\".",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly today. One of the earliest symptoms of AD is olfactory dysfunction. The present study investigated the effects of amyloid beta precursor protein (AbetaPP) metabolites, including amyloid-beta (Abeta) and AbetaPP C-terminal fragments (CTF), on olfactory processing in the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) using the Tg2576 mouse model of human AbetaPP over-expression. The entorhinal cortex is an early target of AD related neuropathology, and the LEC plays an important role in fine odor discrimination and memory. Cohorts of transgenic and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice at 3, 6, and 16months of age (MO) were anesthetized and acute, single-unit electrophysiology was performed in the LEC. Results showed that Tg2576 exhibited early LEC hyperactivity at 3 and 6MO compared to WT mice in both local field potential and single-unit spontaneous activity. However, LEC single-unit odor responses and odor receptive fields showed no detectable difference compared to WT at any age. Finally, the very early emergence of olfactory system hyper-excitability corresponded not to detectable Abeta deposition in the olfactory system, but rather to high levels of intracellular AbetaPP-CTF and soluble Abeta in the anterior piriform cortex (aPCX), a major afferent input to the LEC, by 3MO. The present results add to the growing evidence of AbetaPP-related hyper-excitability, and further implicate both soluble Abeta and non-Abeta AbetaPP metabolites in its early emergence.",

In the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and in AD animal models, the chemokine CXCL10 is found in high concentrations, suggesting a pathogenic role for this chemokine and its receptor, CXCR3. Recent studies aimed at addressing the role of CXCR3 in neurological diseases indicate potent, but diverse, functions for CXCR3. Here, we examined the impact of CXCR3 in the amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic mouse model of AD. We found that, compared with control APP/PSI animals, plaque burden and Abeta levels were strongly reduced in CXCR3-deficient APP/PS1 mice. Analysis of microglial phagocytosis in vitro and in vivo demonstrated that CXCR3 deficiency increased the microglial uptake of Abeta. Application of a CXCR3 antagonist increased microglial Abeta phagocytosis, which was associated with reduced TNF-alpha secretion. Moreover, in CXCR3-deficient APP/PS1 mice, microglia exhibited morphological activation and reduced plaque association, and brain tissue from APP/PS1 animals lacking CXCR3 had reduced concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines compared with controls. Further, loss of CXCR3 attenuated the behavioral deficits observed in APP/PS1 mice. Together, our data indicate that CXCR3 signaling mediates development of AD-like pathology in APP/PS1 mice and suggest that CXCR3 has potential as a therapeutic target for AD.",

    "abstract": "The human endothelin converting enzyme-1 (hECE-1) is a homodimer linked by a single disulfide bridge and has been identified as an important target for Alzheimer's disease. Structural analysis of hECE-1 dimer could lead to design specific and effective therapies against Alzheimer's disease. Hence, in the present study homology model of transmembrane helix has been constructed and patched with available crystal structure of hECE-1 monomer. Then, membrane-bound whole model of hECE-1 dimer has been developed by considering biophysical properties of membrane proteins. The explicit molecular dynamics simulation revealed that the hECE-1 dimer exhibits conformational restrains and controls total central cavity by regulating the degree of fluctuations in some residues (238-226) for substrate/product entrance/exit sites. In turn, conformational rearrangements of interdomain linkers as well as helices close to the inner surface are responsible for increasing total central cavity of hECE-1 dimer. Further, the model of hECE-1 dimer was docked with Abeta1-42 followed by MD simulation to investigate possible orientation and interactions of Abeta1-42 in catalytic groove of hECE-1 dimer. The free energy calculations exposed the stability of complex and helped us to identify key residues of hECE-1 involved in interactions with Abeta1-42 peptide. Hence, the present study might be useful to understand structural significance of membrane-bound dimeric hECE-1 to design therapies against Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "In addition to cognitive impairments, deficits in non-cognitive behaviors are also common neurological sequelae in Alzheimer's disease and its animal models. Hesperidin, a flavanone glycoside found abundantly in citrus fruits, was orally given (100 mg/kg body weight) to 5-month-old transgenic APP/PS1 mice, a mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis for Alzheimer's disease. After a relatively short-term treatment of 10 days, hesperidin significantly restored deficits in non-cognitive nesting ability and social interaction. Further immunohistochemical analysis showed significantly attenuated beta-amyloid deposition, plaque associated APP expression, microglial activation and TGF-beta immunoreactivity in brains of APP/PS1 mice, which suggests that ameliorated behavioral impairments might be attributable to reduced Abeta deposition and attenuated neuro-inflammatory reaction. Additionally, efficient anti-inflammatory effects of hesperidin were confirmed in vitro. Our findings suggest that hesperidin might be a potential candidate for the treatment of AD or even other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can reflect some of the pathophysiological changes that occur in the brain, and the number of CSF biomarkers under investigation in neurodegenerative conditions has grown rapidly in the past 20 years. In AD, CSF biomarkers are increasingly being used in clinical practice, and have been incorporated into the majority of clinical trials to demonstrate target engagement, to enrich or stratify patient groups, and to find evidence of disease modification. In PD, CSF biomarkers have not yet reached the clinic, but are being studied in patients with parkinsonism, and are being used in clinical trials either to monitor progression or to demonstrate target engagement and downstream effects of drugs. CSF biomarkers might also serve as surrogate markers of clinical benefit after a specific therapeutic intervention, although additional data are required. It is anticipated that CSF biomarkers will have an important role in trials aimed at disease modification in the near future.

Here we report a high-throughput method based on ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) that is capable of rapidly detecting small molecules that bind to amyloid precursors, identifying the interacting protein species and defining the mode of inhibition. Using this method we have classified a variety of small molecules that are potential inhibitors of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregation or amyloid-beta 1-40 aggregation as specific, nonspecific, colloidal or non-interacting. We also demonstrate the ability of IMS-MS to screen for inhibitory small molecules in a 96-well plate format and use this to discover a new inhibitor of hIAPP amyloid assembly.",

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Number of cycles performed, by country and region, including pregnancies, single and multiple birth rates, and perinatal mortality. RESULT(S): Overall, >1,251,881 procedures with ART were reported, and resulted in 229,442 reported babies born. The availability of ART varied by country, from 12 to 4,140 treatments per million population. Of all aspiration cycles, 65.2% (400,617 of 614,540) were intracytoplasmic sperm injection. The overall delivery rate per fresh aspiration was 20.3%, and for frozen-embryo transfer (FET), 18.4%, with a cumulative delivery rate of 25.8%. With wide regional variations, single-embryo transfer represented 23.4% of fresh transfers, and the proportion of deliveries with twins and triplets from fresh transfers was 22.3% and 1.2%, respectively. The perinatal mortality rate was 19.9 per 1,000 births for fresh in vitro fertilization using intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and 9.6 per 1,000 for FET. The proportion of women aged >=40 years increased to 19.8% from 15.5% in 2006. CONCLUSION(S): The international trend toward <3 transferred embryos continued, as did the wider uptake of FET. This was achieved without compromising delivery rates. The application of ART for women aged >40 years was a major component of ART services in some regions and countries.",

There is also increasing interest in understanding its possible role in the development of intracerebral hemorrhage, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia. In this article, the literature on this subject is reviewed and novel findings relating CAA to subcortical white matter damage in 224 subjects in the Oxford project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA) are reported. The relationship between CAA and subcortical tissue damage in the OPTIMA subjects was found to be critically dependent on ApoE genotype, there being a positive relationship between measures of CAA and subcortical small vessel disease in ApoEepsilon4 carriers and a significant negative relationship in ApoEepsilon2 carriers. These findings draw attention, as have many other studies, to the importance of ApoE genotype as a major risk factor not only for dementia but also for damage to blood vessels in the aging brain.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Knowledge of Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifestation in the pre-dementia stage facilitates the selection of appropriate measures for early detection and disease progression. OBJECTIVE: To examine the trajectories of cognitive performance, gray matter volume (GMV), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, together with the influence of apolipoprotein E (APOE) in subjects with amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits across the pre-clinical to dementia stages of AD. METHODS: 356 subjects were dichotomized into Abeta+ and Abeta- groups based on their CSF Abeta1-42 level. We derived AD-related atrophic regions (AD-ROIs) using the voxel-based morphometry approach. We characterized the trajectories of cognitive scores, GMV at AD-ROIs, and CSF biomarkers from preclinical to disease stages in Abeta+ subjects. The effect of APOE epsilon4 genotype on these trajectories was examined. RESULTS: Impairments in executive functioning/processing speed (EF/PS) and atrophy at the right supramarginal/inferior parietal gyrus were detected in cognitively normal Abeta+ subjects. Together with the APOE epsilon4 carrier status, these measures showed potential to identify cognitively normal elderly with abnormal CSF Abeta1-42 level in another independent cohort. Subsequently, impairment in memory, visuospatial, language, and attention as well as atrophy in the temporal lobe, thalamus, and mid-cingulate cortex were detectable in Abeta+ mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. In MCI and dementia Abeta+ subjects, epsilon4 carriers had more severe atrophy of the medial temporal lobe and memory impairment but higher EF/PS compared to non-carriers. CONCLUSIONS: EF/PS decline and right parietal atrophy might act as non-invasive screening tests for abnormal amyloid deposition in cognitively normal elderly. APOE modulation on subsequent trajectories in cognition and atrophy should be taken into account when analyzing disease progression.",

    "abstract": "SorLA is a neuronal sorting receptor that is genetically associated with Alzheimer disease. SorLA interacts directly with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and affects the processing of the precursor, leading to a decreased generation of the amyloid-beta peptide. The SorLA complement-type repeat (CR) domains associate in vitro with APP, but the precise molecular determinants of SorLA APP complex formation and the mechanisms responsible for the effect of binding on APP processing have not yet been elucidated. Here, we have generated protein expression constructs for SorLA devoid of the 11 CR-domains and for two SorLA mutants harboring substitutions of the fingerprint residues in the central CR-domains. We generated SH-SY5Y cell lines that stably express these SorLA variants to study the binding and processing of APP using co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting/ELISAs, respectively. We found that the SorLA CR-cluster is essential for interaction with APP and that deletion of the CR-cluster abolishes the protection against APP processing. Mutation of identified fingerprint residues in the SorLA CR-domains leads to changes in the O-linked glycosylation of APP when expressed in SH-SY5Y cells. Our results provide novel information on the mechanisms behind the influence of SorLA activity on APP metabolism by controlling post-translational glycosylation in the Golgi, suggesting new strategies against amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer disease.",

Using the quenching of a fluorescent probe by Cu(2+), the mechanism of Abeta/Cu(2+) interactions in physiologically relevant conditions has been elucidated. Cu(2+) binds to Abeta at a near diffusion-limited rate, initially forming component I. The switching between component I and II occurs on the second timescale, with a significant energy barrier. Component I is much more reactive towards Cu(2+) ligands and likely responsible for initial Abeta dimer formation. Clioquinol (CQ) is shown to sequester Cu(2+) more effectively than other tested ligands. These findings have implications for the potential roles of Abeta in regulating neurotransmission, and for the screening of small molecules targeting Abeta-metal interactions.",

Here, we report a sensitive molecular magnetic resonance imaging contrast probe that is specific for Abeta oligomers. We attach oligomer-specific antibodies onto magnetic nanostructures and show that the complex is stable and binds to Abeta oligomers on cells and brain tissues to give a magnetic resonance imaging signal. When intranasally administered to an Alzheimer's disease mouse model, the probe readily reached hippocampal Abeta oligomers. In isolated samples of human brain tissue, we observed a magnetic resonance imaging signal that distinguished Alzheimer's disease from controls. Such nanostructures that target neurotoxic Abeta oligomers are potentially useful for evaluating the efficacy of new drugs and ultimately for early-stage Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and disease management.",

Consequently, synaptic biomarkers may be valuable tools for both early diagnosis and disease stage. Neurogranin (Ng) is a postsynaptic protein involved in memory consolidation. METHODS: We developed three monoclonal anti-Ng antibodies. Mass spectrometry and a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ng in three independent clinical cohorts including patients with AD dementia (n = 100 in total), mild cognitive impairment patients (MCI), (n = 40) and controls (n = 80 in total). RESULTS: We show in three independent clinical cohorts a marked increase in CSF Ng levels in AD dementia (P < .001 in all studies). In addition, high CSF Ng levels at the MCI stage predicted progression to dementia due to AD with a hazard ratio of 12.8 (95% confidence interval 1.6-103.0, P = .02). In amyloid-positive MCI patients, high CSF Ng correlated with a more rapid change in cognition during clinical follow-up (P = .03). DISCUSSION: These results suggest that CSF Ng is a novel AD biomarker that may be used to monitor synaptic degeneration, and correlates with the rate of cognitive decline in prodromal AD.",

Utilizing atomic force microscope controlled tip-enhanced Raman scattering, we directly observe the secondary structure information for Abeta(1-40) assembly in situ at the nanoscale. D- or L-NIBC on the surface can guide parallel or nonparallel alignment of beta-hairpins through a two-step process based on electrostatic-interaction-enhanced adsorption and subsequent stereoselective recognition.

    "abstract": "Filamentous tau pathologies are hallmark lesions of several neurodegenerative tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) which show cell type-specific and topographically distinct tau inclusions. Growing evidence supports templated transmission of tauopathies through functionally interconnected neuroanatomical pathways suggesting that different self-propagating strains of pathological tau could account for the diverse manifestations of neurodegenerative tauopathies. Here, we describe the rapid and distinct cell type-specific spread of pathological tau following intracerebral injections of CBD or AD brain extracts enriched in pathological tau (designated CBD-Tau and AD-Tau, respectively) in young human mutant P301S tau transgenic (Tg) mice (line PS19) ~6-9 months before they show onset of mutant tau transgene-induced tau pathology. At 1 month post-injection of CBD-Tau, tau inclusions developed predominantly in oligodendrocytes of the fimbria and white matter near the injection sites with infrequent intraneuronal tau aggregates. In contrast, injections of AD-Tau in young PS19 mice induced tau pathology predominantly in neuronal perikarya with little or no oligodendrocyte involvement 1 month post-injection. With longer post-injection survival intervals of up to 6 months, CBD-Tau- and AD-Tau-induced tau pathology spread to different brain regions distant from the injection sites while maintaining the cell type-specific pattern noted above. Finally, CA3 neuron loss was detected 3 months post-injection of AD-Tau but not CBD-Tau. Thus, AD-Tau and CBD-Tau represent specific pathological tau strains that spread differentially and may underlie distinct clinical and pathological features of these two tauopathies. Hence, these strains could become targets to develop disease-modifying therapies for CBD and AD.",

    "title": "Neuropathology and biochemistry of Abeta and its aggregates in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by beta-amyloid plaques and intraneuronal tau aggregation usually associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Both beta-amyloid plaques and CAA deposits contain fibrillar aggregates of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). Abeta plaques and CAA develop first in neocortical areas of preclinical AD patients and, then, expand in a characteristic sequence into further brain regions with end-stage pathology in symptomatic AD patients. Abeta aggregates are not restricted to amyloid plaques and CAA. Soluble and several types of insoluble non-plaque- and non-CAA-associated Abeta aggregates have been described. Amyloid fibrils are products of a complex self-assembly process that involves different types of transient intermediates. Amongst these intermediate species are protofibrils and oligomers. Different variants of Abeta peptides may result from alternative processing or from mutations that lead to rare forms of familial AD. These variants can exhibit different self-assembly and aggregation properties. In addition, several post-translational modifications of Abeta have been described that result, for example, in the production of N-terminal truncated Abeta with pyroglutamate modification at position 3 (AbetaN3pE) or of Abeta phosphorylated at serine 8 (pSer8Abeta). Both AbetaN3pE and pSer8Abeta show enhanced aggregation into oligomers and fibrils. However, the earliest detectable soluble and insoluble Abeta aggregates in the human brain exhibit non-modified Abeta, whereas AbetaN3pE and pSer8Abeta are detected in later stages. This finding indicates the existence of different biochemical stages of Abeta aggregate maturation with pSer8Abeta being related mainly to cases with symptomatic AD. The conversion from preclinical to symptomatic AD could thereby be related to combined effects of increased Abeta concentration, maturation of aggregates and spread of deposits into additional brain regions. Thus, the inhibition of Abeta aggregation and maturation before entering the symptomatic stage of the disease as indicated by the accumulation of pSer8Abeta may represent an attractive treatment strategy for preventing disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Imbalances between excitatory and inhibitory transmissions in the brain anticipate the neuronal damage and death that occur in the neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously showed that amyloid-beta (Ass), a natural peptide involved in the onset and development of AD, counteracts the neurotrophic activity of the nerve growth factor (NGF) by dampening the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic connectivity of cultured hippocampal neurons. Neuronal plasticity is partly controlled by the NGF-promoted expression of the homologue of enhancer-of-split 1 (Hes1), a transcription factor that regulates the formation of GABAergic synapses. We now show that Hes1 controls the expression of cerebellin 4 (Cbln4), a member of a small family of secreted synaptic proteins, and we present the evidence that Cbln4 plays an essential role in the formation and maintenance of inhibitory GABAergic connections. Cbln4 immunoreactivity was found in the hippocampus, mostly in the dendrites and somata of pyramidal neurons. In the CA1, the hippocampal region where the first neurons degenerate in AD, Cbln4 immunoreactivity was associated with GABAergic synapses (detected by vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter [VGAT] immunostaining), which appear to surround and embrace the somata of CA1 pyramidal neurons (basket cells). Moreover, significant decreases of Hes1, Cbln4, and VGAT immunoreactivities and messenger RNA expression were found in the hippocampus of a mouse model of AD. We also found that either the overexpression of Cbln4 in cultured hippocampal neurons or the application of recombinant Cbln4 to the cultures increased the number of GABAergic varicosities, rescuing neurons from Ass-induced death. In contrast, knockdown of Cbln4 gene in cultured neurons was followed by a large reduction of GABAergic connections. Such an effect was reverted by exogenously added Cbln4. These findings suggest a therapeutic potential for Cbln4 in the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitors of amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation have the potential to serve as lead compounds for anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) agents because Abeta aggregation is a key step in AD pathogenesis. Recently, we developed a novel microliter-scale high-throughput screening (MSHTS) system for Abeta aggregation inhibitors that applied fluorescence microscopic analysis with quantum dot nanoprobes, and attempted to comprehensively screen the inhibitors from spices using this system (Ishigaki et al., PLoS One, 8, e72992, 2013). In this study, we tried to evaluate the inhibitory activities of 11 seaweed extracts on Abeta aggregation using the MSHTS system. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of the ethanolic extracts from all seaweeds exceeded 4.9 mg/ml, indicating that the extracts inhibit Abeta aggregation although this activity was significantly lower than that displayed by members of the Lamiaceae, a family of herbal spices that showed highest activity among 52 spices tested in our 2013 study. On the other hand, the EC50 of boiling water extracts was 0.013-0.42 mg/ml which was comparable with the EC50 of the extracts from the Lamiaceae family. These results suggest that the extraction efficiency of the inhibitors by boiling water extraction was higher than that by ethanolic extraction. Moreover, analysis of fluorescence micrographs, which were obtained from the MSHTS system, revealed that the morphology of the Abeta aggregates coincubated with boiling water extracts differed from control aggregates, suggesting that the MSHTS system is also useful for screening substances that affect the morphology of aggregates.",

Consequently, therapeutic concepts and targets have been increasingly focused on early-stage illness before the onset of dementia; and distinct classes of compounds are now being tested in clinical trials. At present, there is a growing consensus that therapeutic progress in AD delaying disease progression would significantly decrease the expanding global burden. The evolving hypothesis- and evidence-based generation of new diagnostic research criteria for early-stage AD has positively impacted the development of clinical trial designs and the characterization of earlier and more specific target populations for trials in prodromal as well as in pre- and asymptomatic at-risk stages of AD.",

Results indicate that the reaction occurs in two steps: The first step is characterized by the formation of the intermediate. The second step is characterized by breaking the peptide bond of the substrate, the latter being the rate-determining step. In our simulations, the activation energy barrier in the absence of ATP is 15 +- 2 kcal mol(-1), which is 7 kcal mol(-1) lower than in the presence of ATP, indicating that the presence of the nucleotide decreases the reaction rate by about 10(5) times.",

    "abstract": "Reduced cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta42 and increased retention of florbetapir positron emission tomography are biomarkers reflecting cortical amyloid load in Alzheimer's disease. However, these measurements do not always agree and may represent partly different aspects of the underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology. The goal of this study was therefore to test if cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography amyloid-beta biomarkers are independently related to other Alzheimer's disease markers, and to examine individuals who are discordantly classified by these two biomarker modalities. Cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography amyloid-beta were measured at baseline in 769 persons [161 healthy controls, 68 subjective memory complaints, 419 mild cognitive impairment and 121 Alzheimer's disease dementia, mean age 72 years (standard deviation 7 years), 47% females] and used to predict diagnosis, APOE epsilon4 carriage status, cerebral blood flow, cerebrospinal fluid total-tau and phosphorylated-tau levels (cross-sectionally); and hippocampal volume, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography results and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale scores (longitudinally). Cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography amyloid-beta were highly correlated, but adjusting one of these predictors for the other revealed that they both provided partially independent information when predicting diagnosis, APOE epsilon4, hippocampal volume, metabolism, cognition, total-tau and phosphorylated-tau (the 95% confidence intervals of the adjusted effects did not include zero). Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta was more strongly related to APOE epsilon4 whereas positron emission tomography amyloid-beta was more strongly related to tau levels (P < 0.05). Discordance (mainly isolated cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta positivity) differed by diagnostic group (P < 0.001) and was seen in 21% of cognitively healthy people but only 6% in dementia patients. The finding that cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography amyloid-beta provide partially independent information about a wide range of Alzheimer's measures supports the theory that these modalities represent partly different aspects of Alzheimer's pathology. The fact that mismatch, with positive cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta but normal positron emission tomography amyloid-beta, is relatively common in cognitively healthy people may be considered when using these biomarkers to identify early stage Alzheimer's disease. Reduced cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta may be more strongly related to early stage Alzheimer's disease, whereas increased positron emission tomography amyloid-beta may be more strongly related to disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) pathologies have been linked to dysfunction of excitability in neurons of the hippocampal circuit, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are still poorly understood. Here, we applied whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology to primary hippocampal neurons and show that intracellular Abeta42 delivery leads to increased spike discharge and action potential broadening through downregulation of A-type K(+) currents. Pharmacologic studies showed that caspases and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) activation are required for these Abeta42-induced effects. Extracellular perfusion and subsequent internalization of Abeta42 increase spike discharge and promote GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of the Kv4.2 alpha-subunit, a molecular determinant of A-type K(+) currents, at Ser-616. In acute hippocampal slices derived from an adult triple-transgenic Alzheimer's mouse model, characterized by endogenous intracellular accumulation of Abeta42, CA1 pyramidal neurons exhibit hyperexcitability accompanied by increased phosphorylation of Kv4.2 at Ser-616. Collectively, these data suggest that intraneuronal Abeta42 accumulation leads to an intracellular cascade culminating into caspases activation and GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of Kv4.2 channels. These findings provide new insights into the toxic mechanisms triggered by intracellular Abeta42 and offer potentially new therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease treatment.",

Moreover, compound 13 could function as a metal-chelator, penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and show low cell toxicity in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) and SH-SY5Y cells.

    "title": "Running exercise delays neurodegeneration in amygdala and hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease (APP/PS1) transgenic mice.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease. Post-mortem examination and brain imaging studies indicate that neurodegeneration is evident in the hippocampus and amygdala of very early stage AD patients. Exercise training is known to enhance hippocampus- and amygdala-associated neuronal function. Here, we investigated the effects of exercise (running) on the neuronal structure and function of the hippocampus and amygdala in APP/PS1 transgenic (Tg) mice. At 4-months-old, an age before amyloid deposition, the amygdala-associated, but not the hippocampus-associated, long-term memory was impaired in the Tg mice. The dendritic complexities of the amygdalar basolateral neurons, but not those in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 neurons, were reduced. Furthermore, the levels of BDNF/TrkB signaling molecules (i.e. p-TrkB, p-Akt and p-PKC) were reduced in the amygdala, but not in the hippocampus of the 4-month-old Tg mice. The concentrations of Abeta40 and Abeta42 in the amygdala were higher than those in the hippocampus. Ten weeks of treadmill training (from 1.5- to 4-month-old) increased the hippocampus-associated memory and dendritic arbor of the CA1 and CA3 neurons, and also restored the amygdala-associated memory and the dendritic arbor of amygdalar basolateral neurons in the Tg mice. Similarly, exercise training also increased the levels of p-TrkB, p-AKT and p-PKC in the hippocampus and amygdala. Furthermore, exercise training reduced the levels of soluble Abeta in the amygdala and hippocampus. Exercise training did not change the levels of APP or RAGE, but significantly increased the levels of LRP-1 in both brain regions of the Tg mice. In conclusion, our results suggest that tests of amygdala function should be incorporated into subject selection for early prevention trials. Long-term exercise protects neurons in the amygdala and hippocampus against AD-related degeneration, probably via enhancements of BDNF signaling pathways and Abeta clearance. Physical exercise may serve as a means to delay the onset of AD.",

For beta-amyloid (Abeta) fibrils, conventional solid-state NMR structure determination using uniform labeling is limited by extensive peak overlap. We describe the characterization of a distinct structural polymorph of Abeta using solid-state NMR, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Rosetta model building. First, the overall fibril arrangement is established using mass-per-length measurements from TEM. Then, the fibril backbone arrangement, stacking registry, and \"steric zipper\" core interactions are determined using a number of solid-state NMR techniques on sparsely (13)C-labeled samples. Finally, we perform Rosetta structure calculations with an explicitly symmetric representation of the system. We demonstrate the power of the hybrid Rosetta/NMR approach by modeling the in-register, parallel \"Iowa\" mutant (D23N) at high resolution (1.2A backbone rmsd). The final models are validated using an independent set of NMR experiments that confirm key features.",

    "title": "Modulation of insulin signaling rescues BDNF transport defects independent of tau in amyloid-beta oligomer-treated hippocampal neurons.",
    "abstract": "Defective brain insulin signaling contributes to the cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaOs), the primary neurotoxin implicated in AD, downregulate insulin signaling by impairing protein kinase B/AKT, thereby overactivating glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. By this mechanism, AbetaOs may also impair axonal transport before tau-induced cytoskeletal collapse and cell death. Here, we demonstrate that a constitutively active form of protein kinase B/AKT prevents brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) transport defects in AbetaO-treated primary neurons from wild type (tau(+/+)) and tau knockout (tau(-/-)) mice. Remarkably, inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta rescues BDNF transport defects independent of tau. Furthermore, exendin-4, an anti-diabetes agent, restores normal BDNF axonal transport by stimulating the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor to activate the insulin pathway. Collectively, our findings indicate that normalized insulin signaling can both prevent and reverse BDNF transport defects in AbetaO-treated neurons. Ultimately, this work may reveal novel therapeutic targets that regulate BDNF trafficking, promote its secretion and uptake, and prolong neuronal survival during AD progression.",

In this study, we found that the synthetic ceramide analogues dl-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) and (1S,2R-d-erythro-2-N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol (DMAPP) modulated gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage to increase Abeta42 production. Unexpectedly, PDMP and DMAPP upregulated Abeta42 production independent of alteration of ceramide metabolism.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association studies have linked variants in TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) and TREML2 with Alzheimer disease (AD) and AD endophenotypes. Here, we pursue a targeted analysis of the TREM locus in relation to cognitive decline and pathological features of AD. METHODS: Clinical, cognitive, and neuropathological phenotypes were collected in 3 prospective cohorts on aging (n = 3,421 subjects). Our primary analysis was an association with neuritic plaque pathology. To functionally characterize the associated variants, we used flow cytometry to measure TREM1 expression on monocytes. RESULTS: We provide evidence that an intronic variant, rs6910730(G) , in TREM1, is associated with an increased burden of neuritic plaques (p = 3.7 x 10(-4) ), diffuse plaques (p = 4.1 x 10(-3) ), and Abeta density (p = 2.6 x 10(-3) ) as well as an increased rate of cognitive decline (p = 5.3 x 10(-3) ). A variant upstream of TREM2, rs7759295(C) , is independently associated with an increased tau tangle density (p = 4.9 x 10(-4) ), an increased burden of neurofibrillary tangles (p = 9.1 x 10(-3) ), and an increased rate of cognitive decline (p = 2.3 x 10(-3) ). Finally, a cytometric analysis shows that the TREM1 rs6910730(G) allele is associated with decreased TREM1 expression on the surface of myeloid cells (p = 1.7 x 10(-3) ). INTERPRETATION: We provide evidence that 2 common variants within the TREM locus are associated with pathological features of AD and aging-related cognitive decline. Our evidence suggests that these variants are likely to be independent of known AD variants and that they may work through an alteration of myeloid cell function.",

    "abstract": "Increased amyloid beta (Abeta) production by sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the beta- and gamma-secretases contributes to the etiological basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This process requires APP and the secretases to be in the same subcellular compartments, such as the endosomes. Since all membrane organelles in the endomembrane system are kinetically and functionally linked, any defects in the trafficking and sorting machinery would be expected to change the functional properties of the whole system. The Golgi is a primary organelle for protein trafficking, sorting and modifications, and Golgi defects have been reported in AD. Here we hypothesize that Golgi fragmentation in AD accelerates APP trafficking and Abeta production. Furthermore, Golgi defects may perturb the proper trafficking and processing of many essential neuronal proteins, resulting in compromised neuronal function. Therefore, molecular tools that can restore Golgi structure and function could prove useful as potential drugs for AD treatment.",

The aim of the present work was to study the effect of Abeta(pE3-42) expression on neuron loss and associated behavioral deficits using the TBA42 transgenic mouse model. Expression of pyroglutamate Abeta(3-42) triggers hippocampal CA1 neuron loss and behavioral deficits in the TBA42 mouse model. Mice elicited significant neuron death (-35% at the age of 12 months), deficits in the spatial reference memory, working memory, loss of anxiety, and severe motor deficits in an age-dependent manner.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to validate assays for measurement of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)specimens according to regulatory guidance and demonstrate their utility with measurements in specimens from Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies. Methods based on INNOTEST( )beta-AMYLOID(1-42) and prototype INNOTEST( )beta-AMYLOID(1-40) ELISAkits were developed involving pre-analytical sample treatment with Tween-20 for reliable analyte recovery.Validation parameters were evaluated by repeated testing of CSF pools collected and stored in the same manner as clinical specimens. Intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were <=11% and relative accuracy was within +- 10% for both analytes. Dilutional linearity was demonstrated for both analytes from a spiked CSF pool, but not from a non-spiked native CSF pool. Recovery of standard Abeta peptide spikes standard ranged from 77% to 93%. No interference was observed from the investigational drugs LY2811376, LY2886721, LY3002813, or semagacestat. Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) were stable in CSF for up to 8 hours at room temperature and during 5 f reeze-thaw cycles from <=-20 C and <=-70 C. In frozen native CSF specimens, Abeta(1-40) was mostly stable up to 3 years at <=-70 C, whereas stability of Abeta(1-42) was limited to 221 days. Dose-dependent changes in measured CSF Abeta were observed in healthy volunteers up to 36 hours after treatment with the-site cleavage enzyme inhibitor LY2886721. In conclusion, rigorous validation tests have successfully demonstrated the strengths and operational limitations of these INNOTEST( )-based assays.They have proved to be robust and reliable tools for pharmacodynamic evaluations of investigational AD therapeutics in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Heparan sulfate (HS) and HS proteoglycans (HSPGs) colocalize with amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits in Alzheimer disease brain and in Abeta precursor protein (AbetaPP) transgenic mouse models. Heparanase is an endoglycosidase that specifically degrades the unbranched glycosaminoglycan side chains of HSPGs. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that HS and HSPGs are active participators of Abeta pathogenesis in vivo. We therefore generated a double-transgenic mouse model overexpressing both human heparanase and human AbetaPP harboring the Swedish mutation (tgHpa*Swe). Overexpression of heparanase did not affect AbetaPP processing because the steady-state levels of Abeta1-40, Abeta1-42, and soluble AbetaPP beta were the same in 2- to 3-month-old double-transgenic tgHpa*Swe and single-transgenic tgSwe mice. In contrast, the Congo red-positive amyloid burden was significantly lower in 15-month-old tgHpa*Swe brain than in tgSwe brain. Likewise, the Abeta burden, measured by Abetax-40 and Abetax-42 immunohistochemistry, was reduced significantly in tgHpa*Swe brain. The intensity of HS-stained plaques correlated with the Abetax-42 burden and was reduced in tgHpa*Swe mice. Moreover, the HS-like molecule heparin facilitated Abeta1-42-aggregation in an in vitro Thioflavin T assay. The findings suggest that HSPGs contribute to amyloid deposition in tgSwe mice by increasing Abeta fibril formation because heparanase-induced fragmentation of HS led to a reduced amyloid burden. Therefore, drugs interfering with Abeta-HSPG interactions might be a potential strategy for Alzheimer disease treatment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As tau aggregation pathology correlates with clinical dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a tau aggregation inhibitor (TAI) could have therapeutic utility. Methylthioninium (MT) acts as a selective TAI in vitro and reduces tau pathology in transgenic mouse models. OBJECTIVE: To determine the minimum safe and effective dose of MT required to prevent disease progression on clinical and functional molecular imaging outcomes. METHODS: An exploratory double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding trial of MT (69, 138, and 228 mg/day) was conducted in 321 mild/moderate AD subjects. The primary outcome was change on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) at 24 weeks relative to baseline severity. Effect of treatment on regional cerebral blood flow decline was determined in a sub-study in 135 subjects. After 24 weeks, subjects were re-consented to enter sequential 6- and 12-month blinded extension phases. Registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00515333). RESULTS: At 24 weeks, there were significant treatment benefits in two independent populations at the 138 mg/day dose: in moderate subjects on the ADAS-cog scale (treatment effect: -5.42 units, corrected p = 0.047) and two other clinical scales; in mild subjects on the more sensitive regional cerebral blood flow measure (treatment effect: 1.97%, corrected p < 0.001). With continued treatment for 50 weeks, benefit was seen on the ADAS-cog scale in both mild and moderate subjects. The delivery of the highest dose was impaired due to dose-dependent dissolution and absorption limitations. CONCLUSION: The minimum safe and effective daily MT dose is 138 mg and suggests that further study of MT is warranted in AD.",

    "abstract": "One of the earliest neuropathological events in Alzheimer's disease is accumulation of astrocytes at sites of Abeta1-42 depositions. Our results indicate that Abeta1-42 toxic peptide increases lipid peroxidation, apoptosis and cell death in neurons but not in astrocytes in primary culture. Abeta1-42-induced deleterious neuronal effects are not present when neurons and astrocytes are mixed cultured. Stimulation of astrocytes with toxic Abeta1-42 peptide increased p-65 and decreased IkappaB resulting in inflammatory process. In astrocytes Abeta1-42 decreases protein expressions of sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) and over-expresses peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 (PGC-1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), protecting mitochondria against Abeta1-42-induced damage and promoting mitochondrial biogenesis. In summary our data suggest that astrocytes may have a key role in protecting neurons, increasing neural viability and mitochondrial biogenesis, acquiring better oxidative stress protection and perhaps modulating inflammatory processes against Abeta1-42 toxic peptide. This might be a sign of a complex epigenetic process in Alzheimer's disease development.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral accumulation of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is thought to play a key role in the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Three secretases (beta-, gamma-, and alpha-secretase) are proteases that control the production of Abeta from amyloid precursor protein. Increasing evidence suggests that cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains termed 'lipid rafts' are involved in the biogenesis and accumulation of Abeta as well as Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity. gamma-Secretase is enriched in lipid rafts, which are considered an important site for Abeta generation. Additionally, Abeta-degrading peptidases located in lipid rafts, such as neprilysin, appear to play a role in Abeta catabolism. This mini-review focuses on the roles of lipid rafts in the biogenesis and catabolism of Abeta, covering recent research on the relationship between lipid rafts and the three secretases or Abeta-degrading peptidases. Furthermore, the significance of lipid rafts in Abeta aggregation and neurotoxicity is briefly summarized.",

Moderate reduction of calorie intake, known as calorie restriction (CR), reduces pathology in AD mouse models and is a potentially translatable prevention measure for individuals at-risk for AD, as well as an important tool for understanding how the brain endogenously attenuates age-related pathology. Whether sex influences the response to CR remains unknown. In this study, we assessed the effect of CR on beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) pathology and hippocampal CA1 neuron specific gene expression in the Tg2576 mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis. Relative to ad libitum (AL) feeding, CR feeding significantly reduced hippocampal Abeta burden in 15-month-old female, but not age-matched male, Tg2576 mice. Sustained CR also significantly reduced expression of presenilin enhancer 2 (Psenen) and presenilin 1, components of the gamma-secretase complex, in Tg2576 females. These results indicate that long-term CR significantly reduces age-dependent female Tg2576 Abeta pathology, which is likely to involve CR-mediated reductions in gamma-secretase-dependent amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15LO) enzyme is widely distributed within the central nervous system. Previous work showed that this protein is upregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and plays an active role in the development of brain amyloidosis in amyloid beta (Abeta)-precursor protein transgenic mice (Tg2576). In the present paper, we studied the effect of its pharmacologic inhibition on the AD-like phenotype of a mouse model with plaques and tangles, the triple-transgenic mice. Compared with mice receiving placebo, the group treated with PD146176, a specific 12/15LO inhibitor, manifested a significant improvement of their memory deficits. The same animals had a significant reduction in Abeta levels and deposition, which was secondary to a decrease in the beta-secretase pathway. In addition, while total tau-soluble levels were unchanged for both groups, PD146176-treated mice had a significant reduction in its phosphorylation state and insoluble fraction, which specifically associated with decrease in stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity. In vitro study showed that the effect on tau and Abeta were independent from each other. These data establish a functional role for 12/15LO in the pathogenesis of the full spectrum of the AD-like phenotype and represent the successful completion of the initial step for the preclinical development of 12/15LO inhibitors as novel therapeutic agents for AD.",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that aging is the most risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have demonstrated that human telomerase is associated with pathological mechanisms of AD. In view of the central role of telomere and telomerase in the aging process, herein we found that the aggregated form Abeta (Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42), not Abeta monomer, could inhibit telomerase activity both in vitro and in living cells. The beta-sheet structures were essential for Abeta-induced telomerase inhibition. Further studies indicated Abeta oligomers inhibited telomerase activity through binding to DNA RNA hybrid formed by telomeric DNA and the RNA template of telomerase, then blocking telomerase elongation of telomeric DNA. We also identified that intracellular Abeta localized at telomere, and induced cell senescence and telomere shortening. These results indicate that Abeta oligomers can be potential natural inhibitors of telomerase and that inhibition of telomerase activity may be one of the factors for Abeta-induced cytotoxicity. Our work may offer a new clue to a better understanding of aging and AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by gradual declines in social, cognitive, and emotional functions, leading to a loss of expected social behavior. Social isolation has been shown to have adverse effects on individual development and growth as well as health and aging. Previous experiments have shown that social isolation causes an early onset of Alzheimer's disease-like phenotypes in young APP695/PS1-dE9 transgenic mice. However, the interactions between social isolation and Alzheimer's disease still remain unknown. METHODS: Seventeen-month-old male APP695/PS1-dE9 transgenic mice were either singly housed or continued group housing for 3 months. Then, Alzheimer's disease-like pathophysiological changes were evaluated by using behavioral, biochemical, and pathological analyses. RESULTS: Isolation housing further promoted cognitive dysfunction and Abeta plaque accumulation in the hippocampus of aged APP695/PS1-dE9 transgenic mice, associated with increased gamma-secretase and decreased neprilysin expression. Furthermore, exacerbated hippocampal atrophy, synapse and myelin associated protein loss, and glial neuroinflammatory reactions were observed in the hippocampus of isolated aged APP695/PS1-dE9 transgenic mice. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that social isolation exacerbates Alzheimer's disease-like pathophysiology in aged APP695/PS1-dE9 transgenic mice, highlighting the potential role of group life for delaying or counteracting the Alzheimer's disease process.",

METHODS: Thirty-nine subjects with DS (46.3 +- 4.7 years) were assessed with [(18)F]florbetaben PET imaging. Three blinded independent readers assessed the scans to provide a visual analysis. The primary quantitative imaging outcome was a standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) obtained for 6 brain regions. Cognitive status was evaluated using the Dementia Screening Questionnaire for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (DSQIID). RESULTS: [(18)F]Florbetaben uptake was correlated with age (p < 0.0001, R(2) = 0.39); 90% of scans in subjects with DS aged 50 years or older (SUVR = 1.62 +- 0.26), 53% in those aged 45 to 49 years (SUVR = 1.43 +- 0.16), and 7% in those aged 40 to 45 years (SUVR = 1.27 +- 0.11) were visually assessed as positive. Visual and quantitative assessments were highly related (chi(2) = 11.3823, p = 0.0007; Cohen kappa = 0.58). Only 2 of 34 participants were considered to have dementia by the DSQIID. CONCLUSIONS: Brain beta-amyloid binding, as measured by [(18)F]florbetaben, increases with age in DS.

METHODS: We measured markers of amyloid pathology (CSF beta-amyloid 42) and neurodegeneration (hippocampal volume on MRI and cortical metabolism on [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET) in 201 patients with MCI clinically followed for up to 6 years to detect progressive cognitive deterioration. We categorized patients with MCI as A+/A- and N+/N- based on presence/absence of amyloid pathology and neurodegeneration. SNAPs were A-N+ cases. RESULTS: The proportion of progressors was 11% (8/41), 34% (14/41), 56% (19/34), and 71% (60/85) in A-N-, A+N-, SNAP, and A+N+, respectively; the proportion of APOE epsilon4 carriers was 29%, 70%, 31%, and 71%, respectively, with the SNAP group featuring a significantly different proportion than both A+N- and A+N+ groups (p <= 0.005). Hypometabolism in SNAP patients was comparable to A+N+ patients (p = 0.154), while hippocampal atrophy was more severe in SNAP patients (p = 0.002). Compared with A-N-, SNAP and A+N+ patients had significant risk of progressive cognitive deterioration (hazard ratio = 2.7 and 3.8, p = 0.016 and p < 0.001), while A+N- patients did not (hazard ratio = 1.13, p = 0.771). In A+N- and A+N+ groups, none of the biomarkers predicted time to progression. In the SNAP group, lower time to progression was correlated with greater hypometabolism (r = 0.42, p = 0.073).

Neurofibrillary-tangle tau pathology tends to be closer to the gray matter-white matter boundary, whereas Abeta is dispersed throughout the width of the cortical ribbon. METHODS: Using PET radiotracers for tau and Abeta lesions, we developed an image analysis tool to measure the distance of tracer-positive voxels from the gray matter-white matter boundary. We studied 5 AD and 5 healthy subjects with both (18)F-THK5117 (tau) and (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (Abeta) PET. RESULTS: On average, tau-positive voxels were closer to the white matter than were Abeta-positive voxels. This effect was found for all AD subjects and for all regions, both before and after regionally adjusting for the nonspecific white matter binding of both tracers. The differential laminar pattern was validated through postmortem examination.

    "abstract": "Familial prion protein (PrP) mutants undergo conversion from soluble and protease-sensitive to insoluble and partially protease-resistant proteins. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) phosphorylation of wild type PrP (pPrP) at serine 43 induces a conversion of PrP into aggregates and fibrils. Here, we investigated whether familial PrP mutants are predisposed to Cdk5 phosphorylation and whether phosphorylation of familial PrP mutants increases conversion. PrP mutants representing three major familial PrP diseases and different PrP structural domains were studied. We developed a novel in vitro kinase reaction coupled with Thioflavin T binding to amyloid structure assay to monitor phosphorylation-dependent amyloid conversion. Although non-phosphorylated full-length wild type or PrP mutants did not convert into amyloid, Cdk5 phosphorylation rapidly converted these into Thioflavin T-positive structures following first order kinetics. Dephosphorylation partially reversed conversion. Phosphorylation-dependent conversion of PrP from alpha-helical structures into beta-sheet structures was confirmed by circular dichroism. Relative to wild type pPrP, most PrP mutants showed increased rate constants of conversion. In contrast, non-phosphorylated truncated PrP Y145X (where X represents a stop codon) and Q160X mutants converted spontaneously into Thioflavin T-positive fibrils after a lag phase of over 20 h, indicating nucleation-dependent polymerization. Phosphorylation reduced the lag phase by over 50% and thus accelerated the formation of the nucleating event. Consistently, phosphorylated Y145X and phosphorylated Q160X exacerbated conversion in a homologous seeding reaction, whereas WT pPrP could not seed WT PrP. These results demonstrate an influence of both the N terminus and the C terminus of PrP on conversion. We conclude that post-translational modifications of the flexible N terminus of PrP can cause or exacerbate PrP mutant conversion.",

    "title": "Germline oncopharmacogenetics, a promising field in cancer therapy.",
    "abstract": "Pharmacogenetics (PGx) is the study of the relationship between inter-individual genetic variation and drug responses. Germline variants of genes involved in drug metabolism, drug transport, and drug targets can affect individual response to medications. Cancer therapies are characterized by an intrinsically high toxicity; therefore, the application of pharmacogenetics to cancer patients is a particularly promising method for avoiding the use of inefficacious drugs and preventing the associated adverse effects. However, despite continuing efforts in this field, very few labels include information about germline genetic variants associated with drug responses. DPYD, TPMT, UGT1A1, G6PD, CYP2D6, and HLA are the sole loci for which the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) report specific information. This review highlights the germline PGx variants that have been approved to date for anticancer treatments, and also provides some insights about other germline variants with potential clinical applications. The continuous and rapid evolution of next-generation sequencing applications, together with the development of computational methods, should help to refine the implementation of personalized medicine. One day, clinicians may be able to prescribe the best treatment and the correct drug dosage based on each patient's genotype. This approach would improve treatment efficacy, reduce toxicity, and predict non-responders, thereby decreasing chemotherapy-associated morbidity and improving health benefits.",

    "abstract": "This review provides insight into the intraneuronal transport of the Amyloid-beta Precursor Protein (APP), the prototype of an extensively posttranslationally modified and proteolytically cleaved transmembrane protein. Uncovering the intricacies of APP transport proves to be a challenging endeavor of cell biology research, deserving increased priority, since APP is at the core of the pathogenic process in Alzheimer's disease. After being synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum in the neuronal soma, APP enters the intracellular transport along the secretory, endocytic, and recycling routes. Along these routes, APP undergoes cleavage into defined sets of fragments, which themselves are transported - mostly independently - to distinct sites in neurons, where they exert their functions. We review the currently known routes and mechanisms of transport of full-length APP, and of APP fragments, commenting largely on the experimental challenges posed by studying transport of extensively cleaved proteins. The review emphasizes the interrelationships between the proteolytic and posttranslational modifications, the intracellular transport, and the functions of the APP species. A goal remaining to be addressed in the future is the incorporation of the various views on APP transport into a coherent picture. In this review, the disease context is only marginally addressed; the focus is on the basic biology of APP transport under normal conditions. As shown, the studies of APP transport uncovered numerous mechanisms of transport, some of them conventional, and others, novel, awaiting exploration.",

    "abstract": "The CAG repeat expansion in the Huntington's disease gene HTT extends a polyglutamine tract in mutant huntingtin that enhances its ability to facilitate polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). To gain insight into this dominant gain of function, we mapped histone modifications genome-wide across an isogenic panel of mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) and neuronal progenitor cell (NPC) lines, comparing the effects of Htt null and different size Htt CAG mutations. We found that Htt is required in ESC for the proper deposition of histone H3K27me3 at a subset of 'bivalent' loci but in NPC it is needed at 'bivalent' loci for both the proper maintenance and the appropriate removal of this mark. In contrast, Htt CAG size, though changing histone H3K27me3, is prominently associated with altered histone H3K4me3 at 'active' loci. The sets of ESC and NPC genes with altered histone marks delineated by the lack of huntingtin or the presence of mutant huntingtin, though distinct, are enriched in similar pathways with apoptosis specifically highlighted for the CAG mutation. Thus, the manner by which huntingtin function facilitates PRC2 may afford mutant huntingtin with multiple opportunities to impinge upon the broader machinery that orchestrates developmentally appropriate chromatin status.",

We observed significant effects of APOE epsilon4 on Abeta(42) levels in both diagnostic groups by disease stage and region. In contrast, we did not observe a significant effect of APOE epsilon4 on PHF-tau levels by disease stage in any region. Levels of Abeta(42) and PHF-tau in cerebral cortex were correlated more strongly in the Dementia group, and these measures had independent explanatory power for dementia beyond those of standard neuropathologic indices. Associations between Lewy body disease and Abeta(42) or PHF-tau levels and between Abeta(42) levels and microvascular brain injury suggested that these comorbid diseases enhanced the penetrance of Alzheimer disease. Our novel approach brings additional insights into the molecular pathogenesis of common causes of dementia and may serve as a platform for future studies pursuing associations between molecular changes in Alzheimer disease and genetic or environmental risk.",

    "title": "Pin1 dysregulation helps to explain the inverse association between cancer and Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pin1 is an intracellular signaling molecule which plays a critical but opposite role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and many human cancers. SCOPE OF REVIEW: We review the structure and function of the Pin1 enzyme, the diverse roles it plays in cycling cells and neurons, the epidemiologic evidence for the inverse association between cancer and AD, and the potential therapeutic implications of Pin1-based therapies. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Pin1 is a unique enzyme that has effects on the function of target proteins by \"twisting\" them into different shapes. Cycling cells use Pin1 to help coordinate cell division. It is over-expressed and/or activated by multiple mechanisms in many common human cancers, and acts on multiple signal pathways to promote tumorigenesis. Inhibition of Pin1 in animal models has profound anti-tumor effects. In contrast, Pin1 is down-regulated or inactivated by multiple mechanisms in AD brains. The absence of Pin1 impairs tau function and amyloid precursor protein processing, leading to tangle- and amyloid-related pathologies and neurodegeneration in an age-dependent manner, resembling human AD. We have developed cis and trans conformation-specific antibodies to provide the first direct evidence that tau exists in distinct cis and trans conformations and that Pin1 accelerates its cis to trans conversion, thereby protecting against tangle formation in AD. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Available studies on Pin1 suggest that cancer and AD may share biological pathways that are deregulated in different directions. Pin1 biology opens exciting preventive and therapeutic horizons for both cancer and neurodegeneration.

    "abstract": "Memory changes in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) are often characterized by heterogenous trajectories.

We analyzed data from 333 cognitively healthy older adults who participated in a multicenter prospective cohort study with baseline and 18-, 36-, and 54-month follow-up assessments. Latent growth mixture modeling revealed 3 predominant trajectories of memory change: a below average, subtly declining memory trajectory (30.9%); a below average, rapidly declining memory trajectory (3.6%); and an above average, stable memory trajectory (65.5%). Compared with the stable memory trajectory, high Alphabeta (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 2.1), and lower Mini-Mental State Examination (RRR = 0.6) and full-scale IQ (RRR = 0.9) scores were independently associated with the subtly declining memory trajectory; and high Alphabeta (RRR = 8.3), APOE epsilon4 carriage (RRR = 6.1), and greater subjective memory impairment (RRR = 1.2) were independently associated with the rapidly declining memory trajectory. Compared with the subtly declining memory trajectory group, APOE epsilon4 carriage (RRR = 8.4), and subjective memory complaints (RRR = 1.2) were associated with a rapidly declining memory trajectory. These results suggest that the preclinical phase of AD may be characterized by 2 predominant trajectories of memory decline that have common (e.g., high Alphabeta) and unique (e.g., APOE epsilon4 genotype) determinants.",

It was found that a trauma-induced neurological deficit could be partially improved with daily intraperitoneal injections of SkQT1 (250 nmol/kg) for 5 days after the trauma. Neither an analog of SkQT1 without thymoquinone (C12TPP) nor original thymoquinone without a cation residue was effective to improve such conditions. In the SkQ molecule, the phosphonium cation can be replaced by the rhodamine 19 cation, with the SkQTR1 being still active in the treatment of the neurological deficit. Application of 200 nM Abeta to rat hippocampal slices impaired the induction of LTP in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer. A single intraperitoneal injection of SkQT1 (250 nmol/kg body weight) made 24 h before the slice preparation prevented the harmful effect of Abeta on the LTP.

    "abstract": "Collecting duct-derived endothelin (ET)-1 is an autocrine inhibitor of Na(+) and water reabsorption; its deficiency causes hypertension and water retention. Extracellular fluid volume expansion increases collecting duct ET-1, thereby promoting natriuresis and diuresis; however, how this coupling between volume expansion and collecting duct ET-1 occurs is incompletely understood. One possibility is that volume expansion increases tubular fluid flow. To investigate this, cultured IMCD3 cells were subjected to static or flow conditions. Exposure to a shear stress of 2 dyn/cm(2) for 2 h increased ET-1 mRNA content by ~2.3-fold. Absence of perfusate Ca(2+), chelation of intracellular Ca(2+), or inhibition of Ca(2+) signaling (calmodulin, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase, calcineurin, PKC, or phospholipase C) prevented the flow response. Evaluation of possible flow-activated Ca(2+) entry pathways revealed no role for transient receptor potential (TRP)C3, TRPC6, and TRPV4; however, cells with TRPP2 (polycystin-2) knockdown had no ET-1 flow response. Flow increased intracellular Ca(2+) was blunted in TRPP2 knockdown cells. Nonspecific blockade of P2 receptors, as well as specific inhibition of P2X7 and P2Y2 receptors, prevented the ET-1 flow response. The ET-1 flow response was not affected by inhibition of either epithelial Na(+) channels or the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that in IMCD3 cells, flow, via polycystin-2 and P2 receptors, engages Ca(2+)-dependent signaling pathways that stimulate ET-1 synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) metabolism and the accumulation of its derivative amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in senile plaques have been considered key players in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms underlying the generation and the deposition of Abeta are not clear but emphasis has been given in the role of AbetaPP protein interactions that regulate its processing and offer a means to manipulate Abeta production. We have previously shown that AbetaPP interacts with members of the Homer protein family, which leads to inhibition of Abeta generation. Herein, we studied the structural parameters of AbetaPP/Homer3 interaction by analyzing the sequences and domains that play a role in the formation of the complex. We found that the cytoplasmic tail of AbetaPP is necessary for the interaction. Regarding Homer3, we report that both the EVH1 protein interacting domain and the polymerization coiled coil domain are essential for the complex assembly. Importantly, phosphorylation of Homers at certain serine residues seems to enhance the interaction with AbetaPP, possibly underlying our recent work suggesting that calcium signaling also regulates the interaction. Our results show that the regulation of AbetaPP/Homer3 interaction might be critical in the context of Alzheimer's disease pathology as a novel target for regulating AbetaPP function and metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Brain thiamine homeostasis has an important role in energy metabolism and displays reduced activity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thiamine deficiency (TD) induces regionally specific neuronal death in the animal and human brains associated with a mild chronic impairment of oxidative metabolism. These features make the TD model amenable to investigate the cellular mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Once activated by various cellular stresses, including oxidative stress, PKR acts as a pro-apoptotic kinase and negatively controls the protein translation leading to an increase of BACE1 translation. In this study, we used a mouse TD model to assess the involvement of PKR in neuronal death and the molecular mechanisms of AD. Our results showed that the TD model activates the PKR-eIF2alpha pathway, increases the BACE1 expression levels of Abeta in specific thalamus nuclei and induces motor deficits and neurodegeneration. These effects are reversed by PKR downregulation (using a specific inhibitor or in PKR knockout mice).",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta), especially N-truncated forms including Abeta4-42. These are thought to be neurotoxic. However, individuals may live for decades with biomarker evidence of cerebral beta-amyloidosis (positive amyloid PET imaging and/or low cerebrospinal fluid levels of the 42 amino acid form of Abeta) without cognitive impairment. This condition may be termed pathological ageing (PA). OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether there is a difference in the cerebral Abeta fragment pattern in brain specimens from non-demented (PA) and demented (AD) individuals expressing the full neuropathological triad of AD (senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration). METHODS: We extracted Abeta using formic acid and hybrid (6E10 and 4G8) immunoprecipitation from fresh-frozen temporal cortex tissue of 6 elderly individuals (mean age +- SD: 89 +- 3.5 years) with PA and 10 patients with AD (mean age +- SD: 72 +- 8.5 years). The full spectrum of Abeta peptides was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. RESULTS: AD patients had generally more N-terminally truncated and pyroglutamate-modified Abeta than PA patients, whereas PA patients had on average more Abeta1-40 than AD patients. CONCLUSION: Senile plaques in AD may have an Abeta fragment composition distinct from PA with more N-terminally and pyroglutamate-modified Abeta peptides that may be linked to neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "The beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1), an essential protease for the generation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, is a major drug target for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there is a concern that inhibiting BACE1 could also affect several physiological functions. Here, we show that BACE1 is modified with bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), a sugar modification highly expressed in brain, and demonstrate that AD patients have higher levels of bisecting GlcNAc on BACE1. Analysis of knockout mice lacking the biosynthetic enzyme for bisecting GlcNAc, GnT-III (Mgat3), revealed that cleavage of Abeta-precursor protein (APP) by BACE1 is reduced in these mice, resulting in a decrease in Abeta plaques and improved cognitive function. The lack of this modification directs BACE1 to late endosomes/lysosomes where it is less colocalized with APP, leading to accelerated lysosomal degradation. Notably, other BACE1 substrates, CHL1 and contactin-2, are normally cleaved in GnT-III-deficient mice, suggesting that the effect of bisecting GlcNAc on BACE1 is selective to APP. Considering that GnT-III-deficient mice remain healthy, GnT-III may be a novel and promising drug target for AD therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Our primary objective was to investigate a biomarker driven model for the interrelationships between vascular disease pathology, amyloid pathology, and longitudinal cognitive decline in cognitively normal elderly subjects between 70 and 90 years of age. Our secondary objective was to investigate the beneficial effect of cognitive reserve on these interrelationships. We used brain amyloid-beta load measured using Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography as a marker for amyloid pathology. White matter hyperintensities and brain infarcts were measured using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging as a marker for vascular pathology. We studied 393 cognitively normal elderly participants in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who had a baseline 3 T fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging assessment, Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography scan, baseline cognitive assessment, lifestyle measures, and at least one additional clinical follow-up. We classified subjects as being on the amyloid pathway if they had a global cortical amyloid-beta load of >=1.5 standard uptake value ratio and those on the vascular pathway if they had a brain infarct and/or white matter hyperintensities load >=1.11% of total intracranial volume (which corresponds to the top 25% of white matter hyperintensities in an independent non-demented sample). We used a global cognitive z-score as a measure of cognition. We found no evidence that the presence or absence of vascular pathology influenced the presence or absence of amyloid pathology and vice versa, suggesting that the two processes seem to be independent. Baseline cognitive performance was lower in older individuals, in males, those with lower education/occupation, and those on the amyloid pathway. The rate of cognitive decline was higher in older individuals (P < 0.001) and those with amyloid (P = 0.0003) or vascular (P = 0.0037) pathologies. In those subjects with both vascular and amyloid pathologies, the effect of both pathologies on cognition was additive and not synergistic. For a 79-year-old subject, the predicted annual rate of global z-score decline was -0.02 if on neither pathway, -0.07 if on the vascular pathway, -0.08 if on the amyloid pathway and -0.13 if on both pathways. The main conclusions of this study were: (i) amyloid and vascular pathologies seem to be at least partly independent processes that both affect longitudinal cognitive trajectories adversely and are major drivers of cognitive decline in the elderly; and (ii) cognitive reserve seems to offset the deleterious effect of both pathologies on the cognitive trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) fibrils accompanied with progressive neurite loss. None of the clinically approved anti-Alzheimer's agents target both pathological processes. We hypothesized that conjugation of a metal chelator to destabilize Abeta fibrils (fAbetas) and a long-chain fatty alcohol to induce neurite outgrowth may generate a novel molecular scaffold that targets both pathologies. The hydroxyalkylquinoline J2326 was designed and synthesized by joining an 11-carbon alcohol to 5-chloro-8-methoxyquinoline at the 2-position and its anti-neurodegenerative potentials in vitro and in vivo were characterized. It attenuated fAbeta formation and disaggregated the existing fAbeta zinc-dependently as well as zinc-independently. It also triggered extracellular signal-regulated kinase-dependent neurite outgrowth and increased synaptic activity in neuronal cells. In fAbeta-driven neurodegeneration in vitro, J2326 reversed neurite collapse and neurotoxicity. These roles of J2326 were also demonstrated in vivo and were pivotal to the observed improvement in memory of mice with hippocampal fAbeta lesions. These results show that the effectiveness of J2326 on fAbeta-driven neurodegeneration is ascribed to its novel scaffold. This might give clues to evolving attractive therapy for future clinical trials.",

The inhibition efficiencies (e.g., half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50 value) of these inhibitors could be measured in this work. As far as we know, these IC50 values were reported at the first time. In this assay, the streptavidin conjugated GNPs (SA-GNPs) were employed as indicators to monitor the Cu(2+)/Zn(2+) induced aggregating/disaggregating behaviors of biotin modified beta-amyloid 1-16 peptides (Abeta1-16(biotin)). Because of high affinity of streptavidin (SA) with biotin, the aggregating/disaggregating of Abeta1-16(biotin) results in the significant color change of SA-GNPs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the assay can be used as an effective tool for designing anti-dementia drugs through quantitative analysis of the interactions of four representative inhibitors with Cu(2+)/Zn(2+) induced Abeta assembly.",

    "abstract": "The precursor protein BRI2 that in its mutated form is associated with British and Danish dementia, can regulate critical processes involved in AD pathogenesis including not only the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and formation of Abeta, but also the levels of secreted insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), an enzyme involved in Abeta clearance. We recently observed increased levels of a 45kDa BRI2 form as well as BRI2 ectodomain deposits in Abeta plaques in human AD hippocampus, which may affect BRI2 functional activity. Since BRI2 regulated the levels of secreted IDE and subsequent degradation of Abeta in human cell culture models, we explored if BRI2 changes could affect the Abeta degradation capacity of IDE in human hippocampus (n=28). We observed that IDE is the main enzyme involved in Abeta degradation, and both IDE levels as well as Abeta degradation tend to be decreased in AD. Interestingly, the levels of the 45kDa BRI2 form and BRI2 deposits in hippocampal tissue were inversely correlated with IDE protein levels (r=-0.52, p=0.005; r=-0.4, p=0.045) and IDE activity (r=-0.5935, p=0.0004; r=-0.4, p=0.03). Taken together, the current results suggest a relationship between BRI2 protein changes, IDE activity and Abeta levels in human hippocampus. Thus, the formation and accumulation high of molecular weight BRI2 forms observed in AD may impair IDE functioning and consequently lead to impaired Abeta clearance and to the accumulation of Abeta.",

    "abstract": "A major feature of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in the brain. Recent studies have indicated that Abeta oligomers (Abetao) can interact with the cellular prion protein (PrPc). Therefore, this interaction might be driving some of Abeta toxic effects in the synaptic region. In the present study, we report that Abetao binds to PrPc in the neuronal membrane playing a role on toxic effects induced by Abeta. Phospholipase C-enzymatic cleavage of PrPc from the plasma membrane attenuated the association of Abetao to the neurons. Furthermore, an anti-PrP antibody (6D11) decreased the association of Abetao to hippocampal neurons with a concomitant reduction in Abetao and PrPc co-localization. Interestingly, this antibody blocked the increase in membrane conductance and intracellular calcium induced by Abetao. Thus, the data indicate that PrPc plays a role on the membrane perforations produced by Abetao, the increase in calcium ions and the release of synaptic vesicles that subsequently leads to synaptic failure. Future studies blocking Abetao interaction with PrPc could be important for the discovery of new therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 impairs synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: BACE1 (beta site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1) is the rate limiting protease in amyloid beta production, hence a promising drug target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Inhibition of BACE1, as the major beta-secretase in vivo with multiple substrates, however is likely to have mechanism-based adverse effects. We explored the impact of long-term pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 on dendritic spine dynamics, synaptic functions, and cognitive performance of adult mice. METHODS: Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to assess Abeta40 levels in brain and plasma after oral administration of BACE1 inhibitors SCH1682496 or LY2811376. In vivo two-photon microscopy of the somatosensory cortex was performed to monitor structural dynamics of dendritic spines while synaptic functions and plasticity were measured via electrophysiological recordings of excitatory postsynaptic currents and hippocampal long-term potentiation in brain slices. Finally, behavioral tests were performed to analyze the impact of pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 on cognitive performance. RESULTS: Dose-dependent decrease of Abeta40 levels in vivo confirmed suppression of BACE1 activity by both inhibitors. Prolonged treatment caused a reduction in spine formation of layer V pyramidal neurons, which recovered after withdrawal of inhibitors. Congruently, the rate of spontaneous and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents in pyramidal neurons and hippocampal long-term potentiation were reduced in animals treated with BACE1 inhibitors. These effects were not detected in Bace1(-/-) mice treated with SCH1682496, confirming BACE1 as the pharmacological target. Described structural and functional changes were associated with cognitive deficits as revealed in behavioral tests. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate important functions to BACE1 in structural and functional synaptic plasticity in the mature brain, with implications for cognition.",

    "abstract": "Abeta25-35, the fibril-forming, biologically active toxic fragment of the full-length amyloid beta-peptide also forms fibrils on mica by an epitaxial assembly mechanism. Here we investigated, by using atomic force microscopy, nanomechanical manipulation and FTIR spectroscopy, whether the epitaxially grown fibrils display structural and mechanical features similar to the ones evolving under equilibrium conditions in bulk solution. Unlike epitaxially grown fibrils, solution-grown fibrils displayed a heterogeneous morphology and an apparently helical structure. While fibril assembly in solution occurred on a time scale of hours, it appeared within a few minutes on mica surface fibrils. Both types of fibrils showed a similar plateau-like nanomechanical response characterized by the appearance of force staircases. The IR spectra of both fibril types contained an intense peak between 1620 and 1640 cm(-1), indicating that beta-sheets dominate their structure. A shift in the amide I band towards greater wave numbers in epitaxially assembled fibrils suggests that their structure is less compact than that of solution-grown fibrils. Thus, equilibrium conditions are required for a full structural compaction. Epitaxial Abeta25-35 fibril assembly, while significantly accelerated, may trap the fibrils in less compact configurations. Considering that under in vivo conditions the assembly of amyloid fibrils is influenced by the presence of extracellular matrix components, the ultimate fibril structure is likely to be influenced by the features of underlying matrix elements.",

    "title": "A kernel machine method for detecting effects of interaction between multidimensional variable sets: an imaging genetics application.",
    "abstract": "Measurements derived from neuroimaging data can serve as markers of disease and/or healthy development, are largely heritable, and have been increasingly utilized as (intermediate) phenotypes in genetic association studies. To date, imaging genetic studies have mostly focused on discovering isolated genetic effects, typically ignoring potential interactions with non-genetic variables such as disease risk factors, environmental exposures, and epigenetic markers. However, identifying significant interaction effects is critical for revealing the true relationship between genetic and phenotypic variables, and shedding light on disease mechanisms. In this paper, we present a general kernel machine based method for detecting effects of the interaction between multidimensional variable sets. This method can model the joint and epistatic effect of a collection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), accommodate multiple factors that potentially moderate genetic influences, and test for nonlinear interactions between sets of variables in a flexible framework. As a demonstration of application, we applied the method to the data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to detect the effects of the interactions between candidate Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk genes and a collection of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, on hippocampal volume measurements derived from structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Our method identified that two genes, CR1 and EPHA1, demonstrate significant interactions with CVD risk factors on hippocampal volume, suggesting that CR1 and EPHA1 may play a role in influencing AD-related neurodegeneration in the presence of CVD risks.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease pathology (AD) originates in the hippocampus and subsequently spreads to temporal, parietal, and prefrontal association cortices in a relatively stereotyped progression. Current evidence attributes this orderly progression to transneuronal transmission of misfolded proteins along the projection pathways of affected neurons. A network diffusion model was recently proposed to mathematically predict disease topography resulting from transneuronal transmission on the brain's connectivity network. Here, we use this model to predict future patterns of regional atrophy and metabolism from baseline regional patterns of 418 subjects. The model accurately predicts end-of-study regional atrophy and metabolism starting from baseline data, with significantly higher correlation strength than given by the baseline statistics directly. The model's rate parameter encapsulates overall atrophy progression rate; group analysis revealed this rate to depend on diagnosis as well as baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker levels. This work helps validate the model as a prognostic tool for Alzheimer's disease assessment.",

    "title": "Amyloid beta oligomers in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, treatment, and diagnosis.",
    "abstract": "Protein aggregation is common to dozens of diseases including prionoses, diabetes, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Over the past 15 years, there has been a paradigm shift in understanding the structural basis for these proteinopathies. Precedent for this shift has come from investigation of soluble Abeta oligomers (AbetaOs), toxins now widely regarded as instigating neuron damage leading to Alzheimer's dementia. Toxic AbetaOs accumulate in AD brain and constitute long-lived alternatives to the disease-defining Abeta fibrils deposited in amyloid plaques. Key experiments using fibril-free AbetaO solutions demonstrated that while Abeta is essential for memory loss, the fibrillar Abeta in amyloid deposits is not the agent. The AD-like cellular pathologies induced by AbetaOs suggest their impact provides a unifying mechanism for AD pathogenesis, explaining why early stage disease is specific for memory and accounting for major facets of AD neuropathology. Alternative ideas for triggering mechanisms are being actively investigated. Some research favors insertion of AbetaOs into membrane, while other evidence supports ligand-like accumulation at particular synapses. Over a dozen candidate toxin receptors have been proposed. AbetaO binding triggers a redistribution of critical synaptic proteins and induces hyperactivity in metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptors. This leads to Ca(2+) overload and instigates major facets of AD neuropathology, including tau hyperphosphorylation, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and synapse loss. Because different species of AbetaOs have been identified, a remaining question is which oligomer is the major pathogenic culprit. The possibility has been raised that more than one species plays a role. Despite some key unknowns, the clinical relevance of AbetaOs has been established, and new studies are beginning to point to co-morbidities such as diabetes and hypercholesterolemia as etiological factors. Because pathogenic AbetaOs appear early in the disease, they offer appealing targets for therapeutics and diagnostics. Promising therapeutic strategies include use of CNS insulin signaling enhancers to protect against the presence of toxins and elimination of the toxins through use of highly specific AbetaO antibodies. An AD-dependent accumulation of AbetaOs in CSF suggests their potential use as biomarkers and new AbetaO probes are opening the door to brain imaging. Overall, current evidence indicates that Abeta oligomers provide a substantive molecular basis for the cause, treatment and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "The full-length form of the Drosophila amyloid precursor protein is involved in memory formation.",
    "abstract": "The APP plays a central role in AD, a pathology that first manifests as a memory decline. Understanding the role of APP in normal cognition is fundamental in understanding the progression of AD, and mammalian studies have pointed to a role of secreted APPalpha in memory. In Drosophila, we recently showed that APPL, the fly APP ortholog, is required for associative memory. In the present study, we aimed to characterize which form of APPL is involved in this process. We show that expression of a secreted-APPL form in the mushroom bodies, the center for olfactory memory, is able to rescue the memory deficit caused by APPL partial loss of function. We next assessed the impact on memory of the Drosophila alpha-secretase kuzbanian (KUZ), the enzyme initiating the nonamyloidogenic pathway that produces secreted APPLalpha. Strikingly, KUZ overexpression not only failed to rescue the memory deficit caused by APPL loss of function, it exacerbated this deficit. We further show that in addition to an increase in secreted-APPL forms, KUZ overexpression caused a decrease of membrane-bound full-length species that could explain the memory deficit. Indeed, we observed that transient expression of a constitutive membrane-bound mutant APPL form is sufficient to rescue the memory deficit caused by APPL reduction, revealing for the first time a role of full-length APPL in memory formation. Our data demonstrate that, in addition to secreted APPL, the noncleaved form is involved in memory, raising the possibility that secreted and full-length APPL act together in memory processes.",

Herein, we report the nonclinical and early clinical development of LY2886721, a BACE1 active site inhibitor that reached phase 2 clinical trials in AD. LY2886721 has high selectivity against key off-target proteases, which efficiently translates in vitro activity into robust in vivo amyloid beta lowering in nonclinical animal models. Similar potent and persistent amyloid beta lowering was observed in plasma and lumbar CSF when single and multiple doses of LY2886721 were administered to healthy human subjects.

METHODS: The index was based on 8 markers that have been previously associated with cognitive aging: APOE genotype, plasma beta-amyloid 42/40 ratio, telomere length, cystatin C, glucose, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and albumin. The outcome was person-specific cognitive slopes (Modified Mini-Mental State Examination) from 11 years of follow-up. A total of 1,445 older adults comprised the development sample. An index based on dichotomized markers was divided into low-, medium-, and high-risk categories; the risk categories were validated with the remaining sample (n = 739) using linear regression. Amyloid was measured on a subsample (n = 865) and was included only in a secondary index. RESULTS: The risk categories showed significant differences from each other and were predictive of prospective cognitive decline in the validation sample, even after adjustment for age and baseline cognitive score: the low-risk group (24.8%) declined 0.32 points/y (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.46, -0.19), the medium-risk group (58.7%) declined 0.55 points/y (95% CI: -0.65, 0.45), and the high-risk group (16.6%) declined 0.69 points/y (95% CI: -0.85, -0.54). Using the secondary index, which included beta-amyloid 42/40 (validation n = 279), the low-risk group (26.9%) declined 0.20 points/y (95% CI: -0.42, 0.01), the medium-risk group (61.3%) declined 0.55 points/y (95% CI: -0.72, -0.38), and the high-risk group (11.8%) declined 0.83 points/y (95% CI: -1.14, -0.51). CONCLUSIONS: A risk index based on 8 blood-based markers was modestly able to predict cognitive decline over an 11-year follow-up. Further validation in other cohorts is necessary.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to identify a clinical biomarker signature of brain amyloidosis in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI1) mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cohort. METHODS: We developed a multimodal biomarker classifier for predicting brain amyloidosis using cognitive, imaging, and peripheral blood protein ADNI1 MCI data. We used CSF beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta42) <= 192 pg/mL as proxy measure for Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET standard uptake value ratio >= 1.5. We trained our classifier in the subcohort with CSF Abeta42 but no PiB-PET data and tested its performance in the subcohort with PiB-PET but no CSF Abeta42 data. We also examined the utility of our biomarker signature for predicting disease progression from MCI to Alzheimer dementia. RESULTS: The CSF training classifier selected Mini-Mental State Examination, Trails B, Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall, education, APOE genotype, interleukin 6 receptor, clusterin, and ApoE protein, and achieved leave-one-out accuracy of 85% (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.8). The PiB testing classifier achieved an AUC of 0.72, and when classifier self-tuning was allowed, AUC = 0.74. The 36-month disease-progression classifier achieved AUC = 0.75 and accuracy = 71%. CONCLUSIONS: Automated classifiers based on cognitive and peripheral blood protein variables can identify the presence of brain amyloidosis with a modest level of accuracy. Such methods could have implications for clinical trial design and enrollment in the near future. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that a classification algorithm based on cognitive, imaging, and peripheral blood protein measures identifies patients with brain amyloid on PiB-PET with moderate accuracy (sensitivity 68%, specificity 78%).",

    "title": "Basal forebrain atrophy correlates with amyloid beta burden in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "The brains of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) have three classical pathological hallmarks: amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, tau tangles, and neurodegeneration, including that of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. However the relationship between Abeta burden and basal forebrain degeneration has not been extensively studied. To investigate this association, basal forebrain volumes were determined from magnetic resonance images of controls, subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and AD patients enrolled in the longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) studies. In the AIBL cohort, these volumes were correlated within groups to neocortical gray matter retention of Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) from positron emission tomography images as a measure of Abeta load. The basal forebrain volumes of AD and aMCI subjects were significantly reduced compared to those of control subjects. Anterior basal forebrain volume was significantly correlated to neocortical PiB retention in AD subjects and aMCI subjects with high Abeta burden, whereas posterior basal forebrain volume was significantly correlated to neocortical PiB retention in control subjects with high Abeta burden. Therefore this study provides new evidence for a correlation between neocortical Abeta accumulation and basal forebrain degeneration. In addition, cluster analysis showed that subjects with a whole basal forebrain volume below a determined cut-off value had a 7 times higher risk of having a worse diagnosis within ~18 months.",

Post-mortem tissue analysis indicates BBB damage in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The timing of BBB breakdown remains, however, elusive. Using an advanced dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI protocol with high spatial and temporal resolutions to quantify regional BBB permeability in the living human brain, we show an age-dependent BBB breakdown in the hippocampus, a region critical for learning and memory that is affected early in AD. The BBB breakdown in the hippocampus and its CA1 and dentate gyrus subdivisions worsened with mild cognitive impairment that correlated with injury to BBB-associated pericytes, as shown by the cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Our data suggest that BBB breakdown is an early event in the aging human brain that begins in the hippocampus and may contribute to cognitive impairment. VIDEO ABSTRACT:",

    "title": "Inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation reverses Alzheimer disease phenotypes in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Growing evidence indicates that the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is implicated in the multiple major pathological features of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, whether specific inhibition of JNK activation could prevent disease progression in adult transgenic AD models at moderate stage remains unknown. Here we first investigated the potential disease-modifying therapeutic effect of systemic administration of SP600125, a small-molecule JNK-specific inhibitor, in middle-aged APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. METHODS: Using behavioral, histological, and biochemical methods, outcomes of SP600125 treatment on neuropathology and cognitive deficits were studied in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. RESULTS: Compared with vehicle-treated APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, chronic treatment of SP600125 for 12 weeks potently inhibited JNK activation, which resulted in a marked improvement of behavioral measures of cognitive deficits and a dramatic reduction in amyloid plaque burden, beta-amyloid production, tau hyperphosphorylation, inflammatory responses, and synaptic loss in these transgenic animals. In particular, we found that SP600125 treatment strongly promoted nonamyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and inhibited amyloidogenic APP processing via regulating APP-cleavage secretase expression (ie, ADAM10, BACE1, and PS1) in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. INTERPRETATION: Our findings demonstrate that chronic SP600125 treatment is powerfully effective in slowing down disease progression by markedly reducing multiple pathological features and ameliorating cognitive deficits associated with AD. This study highlights the concept that active JNK actually contributes to the development of the disease, and provides critical preclinical evidence that specific inhibition of JNK activation by SP600125 treatment may be a novel promising disease-modifying therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Extensive oxidative stress has been considered a primary pathological factor for many neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs). We speculated that the oxidative damage to brain cells can be managed by promoting the endogenous cellular antioxidants through the RNA interference (RNAi) against Keap1 (kelch-like ECH-associated protein). Keap1 acts as a negative regulator of Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) that represses the activation of the antioxidant responsive element (ARE). Here, we investigated whether Keap1 knockdown enhances the cellular antioxidant capacity and provides the neuroprotection against oxidative stress from hydrogen peroxide and beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in U87mg cells. We found that the Keap1 siRNA pre-treated group displayed higher expression of diverse antioxidant genes and an increased antioxidant capacity compared to the control group. Moreover, the Keap1 RNAi exerted a cytoprotective effect against H2O2 treatment. In Abeta peptide treatment experiments, the Keap1 siRNA pre-treated groups maintained acceptable cell viability, relatively intact cellular morphology, and controlled oxidative damage levels while the control groups suffered from Abeta peptide-mediated neurotoxicity. Keap1 RNAi also attenuated the oxidative stress-mediated autophagy as well. These findings suggest that Keap1 RNAi can serve as a therapeutic strategy for relieving oxidative stress-associated symptoms in many NDDs.",

    "abstract": "With different approaches to finding prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), many studies pursue only brief lists of biomarkers or disease specific pathways, potentially dismissing information from groups of correlated biomarkers. Using a novel Bayesian graphical network method, with data from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of aging, the aim of this study was to assess the biological connectivity between AD associated blood-based proteins. Briefly, three groups of protein markers (18, 37, and 48 proteins, respectively) were assessed for the posterior probability of biological connection both within and between clinical classifications. Clinical classification was defined in four groups: high performance healthy controls (hpHC), healthy controls (HC), participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and participants with AD. Using the smaller group of proteins, posterior probabilities of network similarity between clinical classifications were very high, indicating no difference in biological connections between groups. Increasing the number of proteins increased the capacity to separate both hpHC and HC apart from the AD group (0 for complete separation, 1 for complete similarity), with posterior probabilities shifting from 0.89 for the 18 protein group, through to 0.54 for the 37 protein group, and finally 0.28 for the 48 protein group. Using this approach, we identified beta-2 microglobulin (beta2M) as a potential master regulator of multiple proteins across all classifications, demonstrating that this approach can be used across many data sets to identify novel insights into diseases like AD.",

    "title": "Comparisons with amyloid-beta reveal an aspartate residue that stabilizes fibrils of the aortic amyloid peptide medin.",
    "abstract": "Aortic medial amyloid (AMA) is the most common localized human amyloid, occurring in virtually all of the Caucasian population over the age of 50. The main protein component of AMA, medin, readily assembles into amyloid-like fibrils in vitro. Despite the prevalence of AMA, little is known about the self-assembly mechanism of medin or the molecular architecture of the fibrils. The amino acid sequence of medin is strikingly similar to the sequence of the Alzheimer disease (AD) amyloid-beta (Abeta) polypeptides around the structural turn region of Abeta, where mutations associated with familial, early onset AD, have been identified. Asp(25) and Lys(30) of medin align with residues Asp(23) and Lys(28) of Abeta, which are known to form a stabilizing salt bridge in some fibril morphologies. Here we show that substituting Asp(25) of medin with asparagine (D25N) impedes assembly into fibrils and stabilizes non-cytotoxic oligomers. Wild-type medin, by contrast, aggregates into beta-sheet-rich amyloid-like fibrils within 50 h. A structural analysis of wild-type fibrils by solid-state NMR suggests a molecular repeat unit comprising at least two extended beta-strands, separated by a turn stabilized by a Asp(25)-Lys(30) salt bridge. We propose that Asp(25) drives the assembly of medin by stabilizing the fibrillar conformation of the peptide and is thus reminiscent of the influence of Asp(23) on the aggregation of Abeta. Pharmacological comparisons of wild-type medin and D25N will help to ascertain the pathological significance of this poorly understood protein.",

    "title": "Presenilin transmembrane domain 8 conserved AXXXAXXXG motifs are required for the activity of the gamma-secretase complex.",
    "abstract": "Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling the physiological and pathological activity of gamma-secretase represents a challenging task in Alzheimer disease research. The assembly and proteolytic activity of this enzyme require the correct interaction of the 19 transmembrane domains (TMDs) present in its four subunits, including presenilin (PS1 or PS2), the gamma-secretase catalytic core. GXXXG and GXXXG-like motifs are critical for TMDs interactions as well as for protein folding and assembly. The GXXXG motifs on gamma-secretase subunits (e.g. APH-1) or on gamma-secretase substrates (e.g. APP) are known to be involved in gamma-secretase assembly and in Abeta peptide production, respectively. We identified on PS1 and PS2 TMD8 two highly conserved AXXXAXXXG motifs. The presence of a mutation causing an inherited form of Alzheimer disease (familial Alzheimer disease) in the PS1 motif suggested their involvement in the physiopathological configuration of the gamma-secretase complex. In this study, we targeted the role of these motifs on TMD8 of PSs, focusing on their role in PS assembly and catalytic activity. Each motif was mutated, and the impact on complex assembly, activity, and substrate docking was monitored. Different amino acid substitutions on the same motif resulted in opposite effects on gamma-secretase activity, without affecting the assembly or significantly impairing the maturation of the complex. Our data suggest that AXXXAXXXG motifs in PS TMD8 are key determinants for the conformation of the mature gamma-secretase complex, participating in the switch between the physiological and pathological functional conformations of the gamma-secretase.",

To explore how anti-inflammatory cytokine signaling affects Abeta pathology, we investigated the effects of adeno-associated virus (AAV2/1)-mediated expression of Interleukin (IL)-10 in the brains of APP transgenic mouse models. IL-10 expression resulted in increased Abeta accumulation and impaired memory in APP mice. A focused transcriptome analysis revealed changes consistent with enhanced IL-10 signaling and increased ApoE expression in IL-10-expressing APP mice. ApoE protein was selectively increased in the plaque-associated insoluble cellular fraction, likely because of direct interaction with aggregated Abeta in the IL-10-expressing APP mice. Ex vivo studies also show that IL-10 and ApoE can individually impair glial Abeta phagocytosis. Our observations that IL-10 has an unexpected negative effect on Abeta proteostasis and cognition in APP mouse models demonstrate the complex interplay between innate immunity and proteostasis in neurodegenerative diseases, an interaction we call immunoproteostasis.",

Human genetic evidence suggests involvement of the cardinal anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL10). We crossed the APP/PS1 mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis with a mouse deficient in Il10 (APP/PS1(+)Il10(-/-)). Quantitative in silico 3D modeling revealed activated Abeta phagocytic microglia in APP/PS1(+)Il10(-/-) mice that restricted cerebral amyloidosis. Genome-wide RNA sequencing of APP/PS1(+)Il10(-/-) brains showed selective modulation of innate immune genes that drive neuroinflammation. Il10 deficiency preserved synaptic integrity and mitigated cognitive disturbance in APP/PS1 mice. In vitro knockdown of microglial Il10-Stat3 signaling endorsed Abeta phagocytosis, while exogenous IL-10 had the converse effect. Il10 deficiency also partially overcame inhibition of microglial Abeta uptake by human Apolipoprotein E. Finally, the IL-10 signaling pathway was abnormally elevated in AD patient brains. Our results suggest that \"rebalancing\" innate immunity by blocking the IL-10 anti-inflammatory response may be therapeutically relevant for AD.",

In this tutorial review, we describe the main chemical and physicochemical features of probes associated with fluorescence emission in the NIR region. The review focuses on the recent progress and improvements in the development of small-molecule NIR fluorescent probes and their in vivo application in living animals.

Multivariate models were built to examine the associations between APOE alleles and AD neuropathological changes, using the APOEepsilon3/epsilon3 group as comparator. Mediation analysis was used to estimate the direct and indirect effects of APOE alleles on AD pathology and cognition (Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes and Mini-Mental State Examination). RESULTS: Compared to APOEepsilon3/epsilon3, APOEepsilon2 is independently associated with lower Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stages and possibly fewer neuritic plaques, but has no direct effect on cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) severity, whereas APOEepsilon4 is associated with more neuritic plaques and CAA, but has no independent effect on Braak NFT stage. Unadjusted analyses showed marked differences among APOE genotypes with respect to cognitive performance (epsilon2 > epsilon3 > epsilon4). Mediation analysis suggests that this is largely explained through effects on pathology. INTERPRETATION: Even when adjusted for age at onset, symptom duration, and other demographic variables, APOEepsilon2 is associated with milder AD pathology and less severe antemortem cognitive impairment compared to APOEepsilon3 and epsilon4 alleles, suggesting a relative neuroprotective effect of APOEepsilon2 in AD.",

    "abstract": "Infectious agents develop intricate mechanisms to interact with host cell pathways and hijack their genetic and epigenetic machinery to change host cell phenotypic states. Among the Apicomplexa phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, which cause veterinary and human diseases, Theileria is the only genus that transforms its mammalian host cells. Theileria infection of bovine leukocytes induces proliferative and invasive phenotypes associated with activated signalling pathways, notably JNK and AP-1 (ref. 2). The transformed phenotypes are reversed by treatment with the theilericidal drug buparvaquone. We used comparative genomics to identify a homologue of the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase PIN1 in T. annulata (TaPIN1) that is secreted into the host cell and modulates oncogenic signalling pathways. Here we show that TaPIN1 is a bona fide prolyl isomerase and that it interacts with the host ubiquitin ligase FBW7, leading to its degradation and subsequent stabilization of c-JUN, which promotes transformation. We performed in vitro and in silico analysis and in vivo zebrafish xenograft experiments to demonstrate that TaPIN1 is directly inhibited by the anti-parasite drug buparvaquone (and other known PIN1 inhibitors) and is mutated in a drug-resistant strain. Prolyl isomerization is thus a conserved mechanism that is important in cancer and is used by Theileria parasites to manipulate host oncogenic signalling.",

    "abstract": "Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases), a unique family of molecular chaperones, regulate protein folding at proline residues. These residues are abundant within intrinsically disordered proteins, like the microtubule-associated protein tau. Tau has been shown to become hyperphosphorylated and accumulate as one of the two main pathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease, the other being amyloid beta (Ab). PPIases, including Pin1, FK506-binding protein (FKBP) 52, FKBP51, and FKBP12, have been shown to interact with and regulate tau biology. This interaction is particularly important given the numerous proline-directed phosphorylation sites found on tau and the role phosphorylation has been found to play in pathogenesis. This regulation then affects downstream aggregation and oligomerization of tau. However, many PPIases have yet to be explored for their effects on tau biology, despite the high likelihood of interaction based on proline content. Moreover, Pin1, FKBP12, FKBP52, cyclophilin (Cyp) A, CypB, and CypD have been shown to also regulate Ab production or the toxicity associated with Ab pathology. Therefore, PPIases directly and indirectly regulate pathogenic protein multimerization in Alzheimer's disease and represent a family rich in targets for modulating the accumulation and toxicity.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We previously showed that a water extract of the medicinal plant Centella asiatica (CAW) attenuates amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced cognitive deficits in vivo, and prevents Abeta-induced cytotoxicity in vitro. Yet the neuroprotective mechanism of CAW is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to identify biochemical pathways altered by CAW using in vitro models of Abeta toxicity. METHODS: The effects of CAW on aberrations in antioxidant response, calcium homeostasis, and mitochondrial function induced by Abeta were evaluated in MC65 and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. RESULTS: CAW decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species and calcium levels elevated in response to Abeta, and induced the expression of antioxidant response genes in both cell lines. In SH-SY5Y cells, CAW increased basal and maximal oxygen consumption without altering spare capacity, and attenuated Abeta-induced decreases in mitochondrial respiration. CAW also prevented Abeta-induced decreases in ATP and induced the expression of mitochondrial genes and proteins in both cell types. Caffeoylquinic acids from CAW were shown to have a similar effect on antioxidant and mitochondrial gene expression in neuroblastoma cells. Primary rat hippocampal neurons treated with CAW also showed an increase in mitochondrial and antioxidant gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest an effect of CAW on mitochondrial biogenesis, which in conjunction with activation of antioxidant response genes and normalizing calcium homeostasis, likely contributes to its neuroprotective action against Abeta toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic approaches addressing beta-amyloid1-42 (Abeta1-42) aggregation represent a promising neuroprotective strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma. MRZ-99030 is a dipeptide containing d-tryptophan and 2-amino-2-methylpropionic acid in clinical development for the topical treatment of glaucoma and AMD. MRZ-99030 is an Abeta aggregation modulator, previously reported to prevent the formation of soluble toxic oligomeric Abeta species. The present study confirmed that MRZ-99030 prevents the formation of oligomeric Abeta species using similar SDS-PAGE experiments. However, additional data from TR-FRET, DLS and AFM experiments revealed that MRZ-99030 does not directly prevent early protein/protein interactions between monomeric Abeta, but rather promotes the formation of large, non-amyloidogenic, amorphous Abeta aggregates and thereby reduces the amount of intermediate toxic soluble oligomeric Abeta species. The affinity of MRZ-99030 to Abeta1-42 determined by SPR was 28.4 nM but the ratio of compound to Abeta is also important: a 10-20 fold excess of MRZ-99030 over Abeta is probably required for effective modulation of protein/protein interactions. For example, in glaucoma, assuming a maximal Abeta concentration of 1-15 nM in the retina, up to 150 nM MRZ-99030 could be required at the protein target. In line with this consideration, MRZ-99030 was able to prevent Abeta-induced toxicity on PC12 cells, retinal ganglion cells and retinal pigment epithelium cells when present at a 10-20 fold stoichiometric excess over Abeta. Moreover, in vivo studies demonstrate the neuroprotective potential of MRZ-99030 after systemic and topical administration in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma/AMD respectively.",

    "abstract": "beta-amyloid1-42 (Abeta1-42) is a major endogenous pathogen underlying the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent evidence indicates that soluble Abeta oligomers, rather than plaques, are the major cause of synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Small molecules that suppress Abeta aggregation, reduce oligomer stability or promote off-pathway non-toxic oligomerization represent a promising alternative strategy for neuroprotection in AD. MRZ-99030 was recently identified as a dipeptide that modulates Abeta1-42 aggregation by triggering a non-amyloidogenic aggregation pathway, thereby reducing the amount of intermediate toxic soluble oligomeric Abeta species. The present study evaluated the relevance of these promising results with MRZ-99030 under pathophysiological conditions i.e. against the synaptotoxic effects of Abeta oligomers on hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) and two different memory tasks. Abeta1-42 interferes with the glutamatergic system and with neuronal Ca(2+) signalling and abolishes the induction of LTP. Here we demonstrate that MRZ-99030 (100-500 nM) at a 10:1 stoichiometric excess to Abeta clearly reversed the synaptotoxic effects of Abeta1-42 oligomers on CA1-LTP in murine hippocampal slices. Co-application of MRZ-99030 also prevented the two-fold increase in resting Ca(2+) levels in pyramidal neuron dendrites and spines triggered by Abeta1-42 oligomers. In anaesthetized rats, pre-administration of MRZ-99030 (50 mg/kg s.c.) protected against deficits in hippocampal LTP following i.c.v. injection of oligomeric Abeta1-42. Furthermore, similar treatment significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits in an object recognition task and under an alternating lever cyclic ratio schedule after the i.c.v. application of Abeta1-42 and 7PA2 conditioned medium, respectively. Altogether, these results demonstrate the potential therapeutic benefit of MRZ-99030 in AD.",

    "abstract": "Familial Alzheimer's disease provides the opportunity to investigate brain changes even before the symptoms onset. We performed a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study in 38 participants from families with presenilin 1 gene mutations: 11 symptomatic mutation carriers, 13 asymptomatic mutation carriers (AMC), with a mean of 16.22 years before the estimated appearance of symptoms, and 14 noncarriers. A subset of subjects was studied longitudinally 2 and 4 years after the first scan. We found decreased cortical thickness (CTh) and volume in cortical and subcortical structures in symptomatic mutation carriers, with progressive loss over time. In AMC, we found increased CTh and volume in temporoparietal regions and in precuneus-posterior cingulate compared with controls at baseline. Longitudinal studies in AMC, by contrast, showed accelerated rates of CTh loss in precuneus-posterior cingulate and superior parietal, right lateral temporal and left orbitofrontal, and middle frontal regions. These findings suggest that brain structure in presenilin 1 mutation carriers follows nonlinear trajectories, with regional increases during the very early presymptomatic period. Initial neuroinflammation and/or accumulation of amyloid species followed by neurodegeneration, or congenital morphometric differences, may explain the observed features.",

Here, we determined the crystal structure of the human sorLA domain responsible for Abeta capture, Vps10p, in an unbound state and in complex with two ligands. Vps10p assumes a ten-bladed beta-propeller fold with a large tunnel at the center. An internal ligand derived from the sorLA propeptide bound inside the tunnel to extend the beta-sheet of one of the propeller blades. The structure of the sorLA Vps10p-Abeta complex revealed that the same site is used. Peptides are recognized by sorLA Vps10p in redundant modes without strict dependence on a particular amino acid sequence, thus suggesting a broad specificity toward peptides with a propensity for beta-sheet formation.",

Caspase-8 is known to be involved in neuronal apoptosis. To explore a possible molecular mechanisms involved in AD pathology, this study investigated the effect of caspase-8 knockdown on amyloid-beta 1-40 (Abeta1-40)-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells. The proliferation of PC12 cells was significantly inhibited in Abeta-treated cells, and a high fraction of the cells underwent apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Transfection of caspase-8 small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in reduced apoptosis following Abeta1-40 treatment. The activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 was stimulated by Abeta1-40, an effect that was also significantly reduced by caspase-8 siRNA. Knockdown of caspase-8 increased the phosphorylation of the signaling molecules AKT and ERK1/2 relative to cells treated with Abeta1-40 alone. Caspase-8 is an important effector molecule involved in apoptosis induced by Abeta1-40 and is likely involved in AD pathology. This study suggests that targeted inhibition of caspase-8 may be a new therapeutic for preventing neuronal apoptosis and inhibiting the progression of AD.",

In the majority of studies amyloid has been considered as the dominant, or sole, aggregation end product, with the presence of other competing non-amyloid aggregation processes, for example amorphous aggregate formation, being largely ignored. Here, we examine possible regulatory effects that off-pathway processes might exert on the rate and extent of amyloid formation - in particular their potential for providing false positives and negatives in the evaluation of anti-amyloidogenic agents. Furthermore, we investigate how such competing reactions might influence the standard interpretation of amyloid aggregation as a two-state system. We conclude by discussing our findings in terms of the general concepts of supersaturation and system metastability - providing some mechanistic insight as to how these empirical phenomena may manifest themselves in the amyloid arena.",

Learning and memory were examined using the Morris Water Maze at 21 and 22 months of age. After the behavioral testing, hippocampal and cortical brain volumes were calculated with magnetic resonance imaging and motor function was evaluated using the rotorod. The amyloid burden and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the hippocampus were determined using immunohistochemistry. We found that dantrolene significantly decreased the intraneuronal amyloid accumulation by as much as 76% compared with its corresponding vehicle control, together with a trend to reduce phosphorylated tau in the hippocampus. No significant differences could be detected in hippocampal or cortical brain volume, motor function or cognition among all experimental groups, indicating that the mice were still presymptomatic for Alzheimer disease.

AD cortical nuclei displayed large variability with average DNA content increases of ~8% over non-diseased controls that were unrelated to trisomy 21. Two independent single-cell copy number analyses identified amplifications at the APP locus. The use of single-cell qPCR identified up to 12 copies of APP in sampled neurons. Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes targeting APP, combined with super-resolution microscopy detected primarily single fluorescent signals of variable intensity that paralleled single-cell qPCR analyses.

    "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by involuntary choreic movements, cognitive impairment, and behavioral changes, caused by the expansion of an unstable CAG repeat in HTT. We characterized the genetic diversity of the HD mutation by performing an extensive haplotype analysis of ~1Mb region flanking HTT in over 300 HD families of Portuguese origin. We observed that haplotype A, marked by HTT delta2642, was enriched in HD chromosomes and carried the two largest expansions reported in the Portuguese population. However, the most frequent HD haplotype B carried one of the largest (+12 CAGs) expansions, which resulted in an allele class change to full penetrance. Despite having a normal CAG distribution skewed to the higher end of the range, these two core haplotypes had similar expanded CAG repeat sizes compared to the other major core haplotypes (C and D) and there was no statistical difference in transmitted repeat instability across haplotypes. We observed a diversity of HTT region haplotypes in both normal and expanded chromosomes, representative of more than one ancestral chromosome underlying HD in Portugal, where multiple independent events on distinct chromosome 4 haplotypes have given rise to expansion into the pathogenic range.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological disease of the young adults. Although being long considered as a pure white matter (WM) disease, growing evidence indicates that in MS the gray matter (GM) is affected as well, and that GM pathology correlates with cognitive function deterioration in MS. Indeed, MS is increasingly recognized to cause cognitive deficits since its early stages. Therefore, the identification of a biomarker with good diagnostic and prognostic power is of great importance for monitoring and preventing cognitive impairment in MS patients. A possibility arises from the combination of two different measures of neuronal injury: the levels of amyloid-beta(1-42) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which have been found associated with cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease (AD); the brain synaptic plasticity, which is a measure of cognitive reserve and can be explored safely in humans by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation. In this review, we discuss the relevance of amyloid-beta(1-42) in MS disease and its link to long-term potentiation (LTP), which is the most studied form of synaptic plasticity, providing evidence for their combined use in cognitive assessment in MS patients.",

We included (1) 133 patients from the German Dementia Competence Network (71 +- 8 years; 50% females; Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE], 24 +- 3); (2) 83 patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (75 +- 8 years; 45% females; MMSE, 24 +- 2); and (3) 452 patients from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort 66 +- 8 years; 47% females; MMSE, 20 +- 5). As endophenotype markers we used cognitive tests, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers amyloid-beta, total tau (tau), tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, and hippocampal atrophy. We measured 19 SORL1 SNP alleles. Genotype-endophenotype associations were determined by linear regression analyses. There was an association between rs2070045-G allele and increased CSF-tau and more hippocampal atrophy. Additionally, haplotype-based analyses revealed an association between haplotype rs11218340-A/rs3824966-G/rs3824968-A and higher CSF-tau and CSF-tau phosphorylated at threonine 181. In conclusion, we found that SORL1 SNP rs2070045-G allele was related to CSF-tau and hippocampal atrophy, 2 endophenotype markers of AD, suggesting that SORL1 may be implicated in the downstream pathology in AD.",

    "abstract": "Donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is a representative symptomatic therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have reported the anti-inflammatory effects of donepezil. However, limited studies that investigate its anti-inflammatory effect in AD have been reported. Considering the role of proinflammatory molecules and microglial activation in the pathogenesis of AD, the current study aimed to elucidate the effects of donepezil on microglial activation induced by amyloid deposition in transgenic mice. Our results showed that chronic treatment with donepezil significantly improved the cognitive function in the novel object recognition test and Morris water maze test in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) transgenic mice. We further demonstrated that these cognitive enhancements were related to the anti-inflammatory effect of donepezil. We found that donepezil could inhibit the expression of CD68, a specific marker of microglial activation, and reduce the release of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta. Immunohistochemistry and Congo red co-staining revealed that congophilic amyloid and activated microglia around plaques were also reduced by donepezil treatment. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis showed that donepezil decreased insoluble Abeta40/Abeta42 and soluble Abeta40 levels. Moreover, donepezil reversed the impaired expression of insulin-degrading enzyme in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Our findings indicated that donepezil improves cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice by a mechanism that may be associated with its inhibition of microglial activation and release of proinflammatory cytokines.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the subjective experience of memory change in groups at risk of dementia (those with mild cognitive impairment MCI or high beta-amyloid (Abeta+) burden) to determine the existence of potential phenomenological typologies. METHOD: We recruited 123 healthy controls (HC) and individuals with MCI from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) study. Sixty-7 (HC = 47,MCI = 20) had Abeta scans available for analysis. Semistructured interviews were administered, transcribed, and meaningful phrases extracted from transcripts. Twelve themes were defined and compared across diagnostic status and Abeta status. RESULTS: MCI endorsed more complaints of burdensome coping strategies, increasing frequency, sense of predomination, poor contextualization, progression, dependency, impact on affect, and dismissive attitudes. HCAbeta+ acknowledged a progressive memory decline compared to HCAbeta-, while MCIAbeta+ expressed more burdensome coping strategies, dismissive attitudes, and dependency comparative to either healthy group. Depression was more likely to be related to complaint themes in HCs, while complaint themes were associated with poorer list-learning performance in individuals with MCI. CONCLUSION: Complaint themes in those with MCI align with the MCI symptom complex, particularly when accompanied with high Abeta load. Healthy Abeta+ individuals acknowledged progressive memory change, suggesting they are aware of memory changes not yet detectable via neuropsychological measures. Depressive symptomatology associated with HC complaints, suggesting certain themes are affect-driven, while complaints in MCI are associated with organically driven functional impairment. Qualitative analysis of SMCs can inform the earliest clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings can inform diagnostic approaches to the clinical evaluation of memory complaints in the nondemented elderly.",

Although important progress has been made in understanding the pathogenesis of AD, current therapeutic approaches provide only modest symptomatic relief. In this study, we evaluated the neuroprotective effect of quercetin (25 mg/kg) administration via i.p. injection every 48 h for 3 months on aged (21-24 months old) triple transgenic AD model (3xTg-AD) mice. Our data show that quercetin decreases extracellular beta-amyloidosis, tauopathy, astrogliosis and microgliosis in the hippocampus and the amygdala. These results were supported by a significant reduction in the paired helical filament (PHF), beta-amyloid (betaA) 1-40 and betaA 1-42 levels and a decrease in BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP (into CTFbeta). Additionally, quercetin induced improved performance on learning and spatial memory tasks and greater risk assessment behavior based on the elevated plus maze test. Together, these findings suggest that quercetin reverses histological hallmarks of AD and protects cognitive and emotional function in aged 3xTg-AD mice.",

    "title": "Interactions between misfolded protein oligomers and membranes: A central topic in neurodegenerative diseases?",
    "abstract": "The deposition of amyloid material has been associated with many different diseases. Although these diseases are very diverse the amyloid material share many common features such as cross-beta-sheet structure of the backbone of the proteins deposited. Another common feature of the aggregation process for a wide variety of proteins is the presence of prefibrillar oligomers. These oligomers are linked to the cytotoxicity occurring during the aggregation of proteins. These prefibrillar oligomers interact extensively with lipid membranes and in some cases leads to destabilization of lipid membranes. This interaction is however highly dependent on the nature of both the oligomer and the lipids. Anionic lipids are often required for interaction with the lipid membrane while increased exposure of hydrophobic patches from highly dynamic protein oligomers are structural determinants of cytotoxicity of the oligomers. To explore the oligomer lipid interaction in detail the interaction between oligomers of alpha-synuclein and the 4th fasciclin-1 domain of TGFBIp with lipid membranes will be examined here. For both proteins the dynamic species are the ones causing membrane destabilization and the membrane interaction is primarily seen when the lipid membranes contain anionic lipids. Hence the dynamic nature of oligomers with exposed hydrophobic patches alongside the presence of anionic lipids could be essential for the cytotoxicity observed for prefibrillar oligomers in general.

    "title": "Amyloid beta oligomer-induced ERK1/2-dependent serine 636/639 phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 impairs insulin signaling and glycogen storage in human astrocytes.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: This study is to investigate the effect of amyloid beta1-42 oligomers on insulin signaling in astrocytes. METHODS: Synthetic Abeta1-42 oligomers were prepared and the oligomeric form of Abeta1-42 was verified by an electron microscope. Normal human astrocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium. Western blotting was employed to measure the amount of lysate proteins. Immunofluorescence was performed to detect the distribution of phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 and expression of P-GSK3beta in astrocytes under confocal microscopy and fluorescent microscopy, respectively. Periodic Acid-Schiff staining was used to detect glycogen, the content of which was measured using glycogen assay. RESULTS: Our data showed that Abeta1-42 oligomers inhibited insulin-induced serine phosphorylation of Akt at 473 and GSK3beta at serine 9, as well as glycogen storage. However, the levels of phosphorylated GSK3beta at tyrosine 216 were significantly increased in the presence of Abeta1-42 oligomers. In addition, the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and insulin receptor substrate-1 at serine 636/639 were significantly increased in response to treatment with Abeta1-42 oligomers. Of note, the responses and inhibitory effects of Abeta1-42 oligomers on insulin signaling were partially reversed by ERK1/2 upstream inhibitor PD98059. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that Abeta1-42 oligomers impaired insulin signaling and suppressed insulin-induced glycogen storage in human astrocytes, probably due to ERK1/2-dependent serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 at 636/639 induced by Abeta1-42 oligomers.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have found that those who suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are more likely to experience dementia as they age, most often Alzheimer's disease (AD). These findings suggest that the symptoms of PTSD might have an exacerbating effect on AD progression. AD and PTSD might also share common susceptibility factors such that those who experience trauma-induced disease were already more likely to succumb to dementia with age. Here, we explored these two hypotheses using a mouse model of PTSD in wild-type and AD model animals. We found that expression of human familial AD mutations in amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 leads to sensitivity to trauma-induced PTSD-like changes in behavioral and endocrine stress responses. PTSD-like induction, in turn, chronically elevates levels of CSF beta-amyloid (Abeta), exacerbating ongoing AD pathogenesis. We show that PTSD-like induction and Abeta elevation are dependent on corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor 1 signaling and an intact hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Furthermore, we show that Abeta species can hyperexcite CRF neurons, providing a mechanism by which Abeta influences stress-related symptoms and PTSD-like phenotypes. Consistent with Abeta causing excitability of the stress circuitry, we attenuate PTSD-like phenotypes in vivo by lowering Abeta levels during PTSD-like trauma exposure. Together, these data demonstrate that exposure to PTSD-like trauma can drive AD pathogenesis, which directly perturbs CRF signaling, thereby enhancing chronic PTSD symptoms while increasing risk for AD-related dementia.",

    "abstract": "gamma-Secretase is a multisubunit protease complex that is responsible for generating amyloid-beta peptides, which are associated with Alzheimer disease. The catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase is presenilin 1 (PS1), which contains an initial substrate-binding site that is distinct from the catalytic site. Processive cleavage is suggested in the intramembrane-cleaving mechanism of gamma-secretase. However, it largely remains unknown as to how gamma-secretase recognizes its substrate during proteolysis. Here, we identified that the alpha-helical structural region of hydrophilic loop 1 (HL1) and the C-terminal region of human PS1 are distinct substrate-binding sites. Mutational analyses revealed that substrate binding to the HL1 region is critical for both epsilon- and gamma-cleavage, whereas binding to the C-terminal region hampers gamma-cleavage. Moreover, we propose that substrate binding triggers conformational changes in PS1, rendering it suitable for catalysis. Our data provide new insights into the complicated catalytic mechanism of PS1.",

    "abstract": "The brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) present elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), a cytokine that has a dual function in neuronal cells. On one hand, TNFalpha can activate neuronal apoptosis, and on the other hand, it can protect these cells against amyloid-beta (Abeta) toxicity. Given the dual behavior of this molecule, there is some controversy regarding its contribution to the pathogenesis of AD. Here we examined the relevance of the long form of Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule (FAIM) protein, FAIM-L, in regulating the dual function of TNFalpha. We detected that FAIM-L was reduced in the hippocampi of patients with AD. We also observed that the entorhinal and hippocampal cortex of a mouse model of AD (PS1(M146L)xAPP(751sl)) showed a reduction in this protein before the onset of neurodegeneration. Notably, cultured neurons treated with the cortical soluble fractions of these animals showed a decrease in endogenous FAIM-L, an effect that is mimicked by the treatment with Abeta-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs). The reduction in the expression of FAIM-L is associated with the progression of the neurodegeneration by changing the inflammatory response mediated by TNFalpha in neurons. In this sense, we also demonstrate that the protection afforded by TNFalpha against Abeta toxicity ceases when endogenous FAIM-L is reduced by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or by treatment with ADDLs. All together, these results support the notion that levels of FAIM-L contribute to determine the protective or deleterious effect of TNFalpha in neuronal cells.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterized by deposition of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) within walls of cerebral arteries and is an important cause of intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, and cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients with and without Alzheimer's Disease (AD). NADPH oxidase-derived oxidative stress plays a key role in soluble Abeta-induced vessel dysfunction, but the mechanisms by which insoluble Abeta in the form of CAA causes cerebrovascular (CV) dysfunction are not clear. Here, we demonstrate evidence that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and, in particular, NADPH oxidase-derived ROS are a key mediator of CAA-induced CV deficits. First, the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin, and the nonspecific ROS scavenger, tempol, are shown to reduce oxidative stress and improve CV reactivity in aged Tg2576 mice. Second, the observed improvement in CV function is attributed both to a reduction in CAA formation and a decrease in CAA-induced vasomotor impairment. Third, anti-ROS therapy attenuates CAA-related microhemorrhage. A potential mechanism by which ROS contribute to CAA pathogenesis is also identified because apocynin substantially reduces expression levels of ApoE-a factor known to promote CAA formation. In total, these data indicate that ROS are a key contributor to CAA formation, CAA-induced vessel dysfunction, and CAA-related microhemorrhage. Thus, ROS and, in particular, NADPH oxidase-derived ROS are a promising therapeutic target for patients with CAA and AD.",

    "abstract": "Destabilized mutant p53s coaggregate with WT p53, p63, and p73 in cancer cell lines. We found that stoichiometric amounts of aggregation-prone mutants induced only small amounts of WT p53 to coaggregate, and preformed aggregates did not significantly seed the aggregation of bulk protein. Similarly, p53 mutants trapped only small amounts of p63 and p73 into their p53 aggregates. Tetrameric full-length protein aggregated at similar rates and kinetics to isolated core domains, but there was some induced aggregation of WT by mutants in hetero-tetramers. p53 aggregation thus differs from the usual formation of amyloid fibril or prion aggregates where tiny amounts of preformed aggregate rapidly seed further aggregation. The proposed aggregation mechanism of p53 of rate-determining sequential unfolding and combination of two molecules accounts for the difference. A molecule of fast-unfolding mutant preferentially reacts with another molecule of mutant and only occasionally traps a slower unfolding WT molecule. The mutant population rapidly self-aggregates before much WT protein is depleted. Subsequently, WT protein self-aggregates at its normal rate. However, the continual production of mutant p53 in a cancer cell would gradually trap more and more WT and other proteins, accounting for the observations of coaggregates in vivo. The mechanism corresponds more to trapping by cross-reaction and coaggregation rather than classical seeding and growth.",

The 42-residue fragment Abeta(1-42) is proposed to be one of the most pathogenic species therein. Here, the soluble Abeta(1-42) species were analyzed by various liquid-state NMR methods. Transient formation of a micelle species was observed at the onset of the aggregation kinetics. This micelle is dissolved after approximately one day. Subsequent loss of this species and the formation of protofibrils are proposed to be the route of fibril formation. Consequently, the observed micelle species is suggested to be on an off-pathway mechanism. Furthermore, characterization of the NMR-observable soluble species shows that it is a random-coil-like entity with low propensities for four beta-strands. These beta-strands correlate with the beta-strand segments observed in Abeta fibrils. This finding indicates that the 3D structure of the fibrils might already be predisposed in the soluble species.",

    "abstract": "An important early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the aberrant polymerization and extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). In young transgenic mice expressing the human Abeta-precursor protein (APP), deposits of Abeta can be induced by the inoculation of minute amounts of brain extract containing Abeta aggregates (\"Abeta seeds\"), indicative of a prion-like seeding phenomenon. Moreover, focal intracerebral injection of Abeta seeds can induce deposits not only in the immediate vicinity of the injection site, but, with time, also in distal regions of the brain. However, it remains uncertain whether the spatial progression of Abeta deposits occurs via nonsystematic diffusion from the injection site to proximal regions or via directed transit along neuroanatomical pathways. To address this question, we analyzed the spatiotemporal emergence of Abeta deposits in two different APP-transgenic mouse models that had been previously inoculated with Abeta seeds into the hippocampal formation. The results revealed a specific, neuroanatomically constrained pattern of induced Abeta deposits in structures corresponding to the limbic connectome, supporting the hypothesis that neuronal pathways act as conduits for the movement of proteopathic agents among brain regions, thereby facilitating the progression of disease.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence points to roles for oxidative stress, amyloid beta (Abeta), and mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In neurons, the base excision repair pathway is the predominant DNA repair (BER) pathway for repairing oxidized base lesions. Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), a multifunctional enzyme with DNA repair and reduction-oxidation activities, has been shown to enhance neuronal survival after oxidative stress. This study seeks to determine 1) the effect of Abeta25-35 on reactive oxygen species (ROS)/reactive nitrogen species (RNS) levels, 2) the activities of respiratory complexes (I, III, and IV), 3) the role of APE1 by ectopic expression, and 4) the neuromodulatory role of ginkgolide B (GB; from the leaves of Ginkgo biloba). The pro-oxidant Abeta25-35 peptide treatment increased the levels of ROS/RNS in human neuroblastoma IMR-32 and SH-SY5Y cells, which were decreased after pretreatment with GB. Furthermore, the mitochondrial APE1 level was found to be decreased after treatment with Abeta25-35 up to 48 hr, and the level was increased significantly in cells pretreated with GB. The oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS; activities of complexes I, III, and IV) indicated that Abeta25-35 treatment decreased activities of complexes I and IV, and pretreatment with GB and ectopic APE1 expression enhanced these activities significantly compared with Abeta25-35 treatment. Our results indicate that ectopic expression of APE1 potentiates neuronal cells to overcome the oxidative damage caused by Abeta25-35 . In addition, GB has been shown to modulate the mitochondrial OXPHOS against Abeta25-35 -induced oxidative stress and also to regulate the levels of ROS/RNS in the presence of ectopic APE1. This study presents findings from a new point of view to improve therapeutic potential for AD via the synergistic neuroprotective role played by APE1 in combination with the phytochemical GB.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: In PET studies of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), prominent hypometabolism can occur in brain regions without major amyloid load. These hypometabolism-only (HO) areas may not be explained easily as a consequence of local amyloid toxicity. The aim of this longitudinal multimodal imaging study was the investigation of locoregional and remote relationships between metabolism in HO areas and longitudinal amyloid increase in functionally connected brain areas, with a particular focus on intrinsic functional connectivity as a relevant linking mechanism between pathology and dysfunction. METHODS: Fifteen AD patients underwent longitudinal examinations with (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PiB) and (18)F-FDG PET (mean follow-up period, 2 y). The peak HO region was identified by the subtraction of equally thresholded statistical T maps (hypometabolism minus amyloid burden), resulting from voxel-based statistical parametric mapping group comparisons between the AD patients and 15 healthy controls. Then functionally connected and nonconnected brain networks were identified by means of seed-based intrinsic functional connectivity analysis of the resting-state functional MRI data of healthy controls. Finally, network-based, region-of-interest-based, and voxel-based correlations were calculated between longitudinal changes of normalized (11)C-PiB binding and (18)F-FDG metabolism. RESULTS: Positive voxel-based and region-of-interest-based correlations were demonstrated between longitudinal (11)C-PiB increases in the HO-connected network, encompassing bilateral temporoparietal and frontal brain regions, and metabolic changes in the peak HO region as well as locoregionally within several AD-typical brain regions. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that in AD amyloid accumulation in remote but functionally connected brain regions may significantly contribute to longitudinally evolving hypometabolism in brain regions not strongly affected by local amyloid pathology, supporting the amyloid- and network-degeneration hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Cross-sectional functional magnetic resonance imaging studies using a memory task in patients with mild cognitive impairment have produced discordant results, with some studies reporting increased hippocampal activity--consistent with findings in genetic at-risk populations--and other studies reporting decreased hippocampal activity, relative to normal controls. However, previous studies in mild cognitive impairment have not included markers of amyloid-beta, which may be particularly important in prediction of progression along the Alzheimer's disease continuum. Here, we examine the contribution of amyloid-beta deposition to cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of hippocampal functional magnetic resonance imaging activity, hippocampal volume, global cognition and clinical progression over 36 months in 33 patients with mild cognitive impairment. Amyloid-beta status was examined with positron emission tomography imaging using Pittsburg compound-B, hippocampal functional magnetic resonance imaging activity was assessed using an associative face-name memory encoding task, and hippocampal volume was quantified with structural magnetic resonance imaging. Finally global cognition was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination and clinical progression was assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating (Sum of Boxes). At baseline, amyloid-beta positive patients with mild cognitive impairment showed increased hippocampal activation, smaller hippocampal volumes, and a trend towards lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores and higher Clinical Dementia Ratings compared to amyloid-beta negative patients with mild cognitive impairment. Longitudinally, amyloid-beta positive patients with mild cognitive impairment continued to show high levels of hippocampal activity, despite increasing rates of hippocampal atrophy, decline on the Mini-Mental State Examination and faster progression on the Clinical Dementia Ratings. When entered simultaneously into the same linear mixed model, amyloid-beta status, hippocampal activation, and hippocampal volume independently predicted clinical progression. These results indicate that amyloid-beta positive patients with mild cognitive impairment are more likely on a path towards Alzheimer's disease dementia than amyloid-beta negative patients. Increased hippocampal activity is discussed in relation to neuronal compensation and/or amyloid-beta induced excitoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is an increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder whose pathogenesis has been associated with aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta42). Recent studies have revealed that once Abeta42 fibrils are generated, their surfaces effectively catalyze the formation of neurotoxic oligomers. Here we show that a molecular chaperone, a human Brichos domain, can specifically inhibit this catalytic cycle and limit human Abeta42 toxicity. We demonstrate in vitro that Brichos achieves this inhibition by binding to the surfaces of fibrils, thereby redirecting the aggregation reaction to a pathway that involves minimal formation of toxic oligomeric intermediates. We verify that this mechanism occurs in living mouse brain tissue by cytotoxicity and electrophysiology experiments. These results reveal that molecular chaperones can help maintain protein homeostasis by selectively suppressing critical microscopic steps within the complex reaction pathways responsible for the toxic effects of protein misfolding and aggregation.",

    "abstract": "White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in the brain are the consequence of cerebral small vessel disease, and can easily be detected on MRI. Over the past three decades, research has shown that the presence and extent of white matter hyperintense signals on MRI are important for clinical outcome, in terms of cognitive and functional impairment. Large, longitudinal population-based and hospital-based studies have confirmed a dose-dependent relationship between WMHs and clinical outcome, and have demonstrated a causal link between large confluent WMHs and dementia and disability. Adequate differential diagnostic assessment and management is of the utmost importance in any patient, but most notably those with incipient cognitive impairment. Novel imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging might reveal subtle damage before it is visible on standard MRI. Even in Alzheimer disease, which is thought to be primarily caused by amyloid, vascular pathology, such as small vessel disease, may be of greater importance than amyloid itself in terms of influencing the disease course, especially in older individuals. Modification of risk factors for small vessel disease could be an important therapeutic goal, although evidence for effective interventions is still lacking. Here, we provide a timely Review on WMHs, including their relationship with cognitive decline and dementia.",

    "abstract": "Genetic and environmental factors that increase the risk of late-onset Alzheimer disease are now well recognized but the cause of variable progression rates and phenotypes of sporadic Alzheimer's disease is largely unknown. We aimed to investigate the relationship between diverse structural assemblies of amyloid-beta and rates of clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease. Using novel biophysical methods, we analysed levels, particle size, and conformational characteristics of amyloid-beta in the posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of 48 cases of Alzheimer's disease with distinctly different disease durations, and correlated the data with APOE gene polymorphism. In both hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex we identified an extensive array of distinct amyloid-beta42 particles that differ in size, display of N-terminal and C-terminal domains, and conformational stability. In contrast, amyloid-beta40 present at low levels did not form a major particle with discernible size, and both N-terminal and C- terminal domains were largely exposed. Rapidly progressive Alzheimer's disease that is associated with a low frequency of APOE e4 allele demonstrates considerably expanded conformational heterogeneity of amyloid-beta42, with higher levels of distinctly structured amyloid-beta42 particles composed of 30-100 monomers, and fewer particles composed of < 30 monomers. The link between rapid clinical decline and levels of amyloid-beta42 with distinct structural characteristics suggests that different conformers may play an important role in the pathogenesis of distinct Alzheimer's disease phenotypes. These findings indicate that Alzheimer's disease exhibits a wide spectrum of amyloid-beta42 structural states and imply the existence of prion-like conformational strains.",

Classically AD has been viewed as a neurodegenerative disease of the elderly, characterized by the extracellular deposition of misfolded amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and the intracellular formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Only recently has neuroinflammation emerged as an important component of AD pathology. Experimental, genetic and epidemiological data now indicate a crucial role for activation of the innate immune system as a disease-promoting factor. The sustained formation and deposition of Abeta aggregates causes chronic activation of the immune system and disturbance of microglial clearance functions.

    "abstract": "The toxicity of amyloids, as Abeta(1-42) involved in Alzheimer disease, is a subject under intense scrutiny. Many studies link their toxicity to the existence of various intermediate structures prior to fiber formation and/or their specific interaction with membranes. In this study we focused on the interaction between membrane models and Abeta(1-42) peptides and variants (L34T, mG37C) produced in E. coli and purified in monomeric form. We evaluated the interaction of a toxic stable oligomeric form (oG37C) with membranes as comparison. Using various biophysical techniques as fluorescence and plasmon waveguide resonance, we clearly established that the oG37C interacts strongly with membranes leading to its disruption. All the studied peptides destabilized liposomes and accumulated slowly on the membrane (rate constant 0.02 min(-1)). Only the oG37C exhibited a particular pattern of interaction, comprising two steps: the initial binding followed by membrane reorganization. Cryo-TEM was used to visualize the peptide effect on liposome morphologies. Both oG37C and mG37C lead to PG membrane fragmentation. The PG membrane promotes peptide oligomerization, implicated in membrane disruption. WT (Abeta(1-42)) also perturbs liposome organization with membrane deformation rather than disruption. For all the peptides studied, their interaction with the membranes changes their fibrillization process, with less fibers and more small aggregates being formed. These studies allowed to establish, a correlation between toxicity, fiber formation, and membrane disruption.",

A preliminary molecular docking study on both the COX-1/COX-2 active sites truly confirmed our hypothesis. Accordingly, a series of ethyl 5,6-diaryl-1,2,4-triazine-3-ylthioacetate derivatives were synthesized and their chemical structures were confirmed by NMR, IR and MS spectra. Further in vitro COX-1/COX-2 evaluations revealed that compound 6c (COX-2 IC50  = 10.1 muM, COX-1 IC50  = 88.8 muM) is the most selective COX-2 inhibitor while maintaining residual inhibition of COX-1. In order to evaluate their potential use against AD, an in vitro evaluation of beta-amyloid fibril formation was performed. The results indicated that the prototype compounds 6 are effective beta-amyloid destabilizing agents while compound 6c could inhibit 94% of the beta-amyloid fibril formation after 48 h.

Several genes have been implicated in AD, but chromatin state alterations during neurodegeneration remain uncharacterized. Here we profile transcriptional and chromatin state dynamics across early and late pathology in the hippocampus of an inducible mouse model of AD-like neurodegeneration. We find a coordinated downregulation of synaptic plasticity genes and regulatory regions, and upregulation of immune response genes and regulatory regions, which are targeted by factors that belong to the ETS family of transcriptional regulators, including PU.1. Human regions orthologous to increasing-level enhancers show immune-cell-specific enhancer signatures as well as immune cell expression quantitative trait loci, while decreasing-level enhancer orthologues show fetal-brain-specific enhancer activity. Notably, AD-associated genetic variants are specifically enriched in increasing-level enhancer orthologues, implicating immune processes in AD predisposition. Indeed, increasing enhancers overlap known AD loci lacking protein-altering variants, and implicate additional loci that do not reach genome-wide significance. Our results reveal new insights into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and establish the mouse as a useful model for functional studies of AD regulatory regions.",

We compared the prevalence and prognosis of Alzheimer's disease at the mild cognitive impairment stage according to these criteria. Subjects with mild cognitive impairment (n = 1607), 766 of whom had both amyloid and neuronal injury markers, were recruited from 13 cohorts. We used cognitive test performance and available biomarkers to classify subjects as prodromal Alzheimer's disease according to International Working Group-1 and International Working Group-2 criteria and in the high Alzheimer's disease likelihood group, conflicting biomarker groups (isolated amyloid pathology or suspected non-Alzheimer pathophysiology), and low Alzheimer's disease likelihood group according to the National Institute of Ageing-Alzheimer Association criteria. Outcome measures were the proportion of subjects with Alzheimer's disease at the mild cognitive impairment stage and progression to Alzheimer's disease-type dementia. We performed survival analyses using Cox proportional hazards models. According to the International Working Group-1 criteria, 850 (53%) subjects had prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Their 3-year progression rate to Alzheimer's disease-type dementia was 50% compared to 21% for subjects without prodromal Alzheimer's disease. According to the International Working Group-2 criteria, 308 (40%) subjects had prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Their 3-year progression rate to Alzheimer's disease-type dementia was 61% compared to 22% for subjects without prodromal Alzheimer's disease. According to the National Institute of Ageing-Alzheimer Association criteria, 353 (46%) subjects were in the high Alzheimer's disease likelihood group, 49 (6%) in the isolated amyloid pathology group, 220 (29%) in the suspected non-Alzheimer pathophysiology group, and 144 (19%) in the low Alzheimer's disease likelihood group. The 3-year progression rate to Alzheimer's disease-type dementia was 59% in the high Alzheimer's disease likelihood group, 22% in the isolated amyloid pathology group, 24% in the suspected non-Alzheimer pathophysiology group, and 5% in the low Alzheimer's disease likelihood group. Our findings support the use of the proposed research criteria to identify Alzheimer's disease at the mild cognitive impairment stage.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: To compare radiation related toxicities among men with low risk prostate cancer treated with single or multimodal radiation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The SEER-Medicare linked database was used to assess the relationship between treatment type and toxicity among men with low risk prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy (BT), external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), or combined therapy between 2004 and 2007. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was utilized to minimize selection bias and control for confounding. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to explore the relationship between treatment and outcomes. RESULTS: Overall 1915 (43.9%), 1893 (43.4%), and 555 (12.7%) patients were treated with EBRT, BT, and combined therapy, respectively. In univariate analyses, combined modality radiation was more toxic than BT alone for GU incontinence (56.76% versus 49.08%), GU obstruction (21.26% versus 19.70%), and erectile dysfunction (22.52% versus 22.24%) (p < 0.01, all comparisons). Compared to EBRT alone, combined modality radiation was more toxic for GI bleeding (7.21% versus 6.21%), GU incontinence (56.76% versus 29.24%), GU obstruction (21.26% versus 14.15%), and erectile dysfunction (22.52% versus 15.35%) (p < 0.01, all comparisons). Among the most frequent radiation toxicity events, the probability of treatment associated toxicity was highest for patients receiving combined modality treatment and lowest for the group treated with EBRT. After multivariate adjustment, EBRT alone demonstrated protective effects against GU obstruction (OR 0.56 [CI 0.50-0.63]), GI bleeding (OR 0.57 [CI 0.48-0.67]), GU incontinence (OR 0.39 [CI 0.36-0.43]), and erectile dysfunction (OR 0.68 [CI 0.61-0.76]) when compared to combined therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The use of combined modality radiation therapy in low risk prostate cancer patients is discordant with clinical guidelines and associated with a significantly increased burden of associated toxicity when compared to EBRT monotherapy. Prudent patient selection and judicious use of combined therapy among men with low risk prostate cancer represents a targetable area to reduce the burden of overtreatment.",

    "title": "APP intracellular domain acts as a transcriptional regulator of miR-663 suppressing neuronal differentiation.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is best known for its involvement in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We have previously demonstrated that APP intracellular domain (AICD) regulates neurogenesis; however, the mechanisms underlying AICD-mediated regulation of neuronal differentiation are not yet fully characterized. Using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches, we found that AICD is specifically recruited to the regulatory regions of several microRNA genes, and acts as a transcriptional regulator for miR-663, miR-3648 and miR-3687 in human neural stem cells. Functional assays show that AICD negatively modulates neuronal differentiation through miR-663, a primate-specific microRNA. Microarray data further demonstrate that miR-663 suppresses the expression of multiple genes implicated in neurogenesis, including FBXL18 and CDK6. Our results indicate that AICD has a novel role in suppression of neuronal differentiation via transcriptional regulation of miR-663 in human neural stem cells.",

    "title": "PBT2 inhibits glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in neurons through metal-mediated preconditioning.",
    "abstract": "Excitotoxicity is the pathological process by which neuronal death occurs as a result of excessive stimulation of receptors at the excitatory synapse such as the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). Excitotoxicity has been implicated in the acute neurological damage from ischemia and traumatic brain injury and in the chronic neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD). As a result NMDAR antagonists have become an attractive therapeutic strategy for the potential treatment of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. However NMDAR signaling is dichotomous in nature, with excessive increases in neuronal intracellular calcium through excessive NMDAR activity being lethal but moderate increases to intracellular calcium levels during normal synaptic function providing neuroprotection. Subsequently indiscriminant inhibition of this receptor is best avoided as was concluded from previous clinical trials of NMDAR antagonists. We show that the metal chaperone, PBT2, currently in clinical trials for HD, is able to protect against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity mediated through NMDARs. This was achieved by PBT2 inducing Zn(2+)-dependent increases in intracellular Ca(2+) levels resulting in preconditioning of neurons and inhibition of Ca(2+)-induced neurotoxic signaling cascade involving calpain-activated cleavage of calcineurin. Our study demonstrates that modulating intracellular Ca(2+) levels by a zinc ionophore is a valid therapeutic strategy to protect against the effects of excitotoxicity thought to underlie both acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "title": "Non-selective NSAIDs improve the amyloid-beta-mediated suppression of memory and synaptic plasticity.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the formation of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques in the brain. Dysfunctional excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity are generally accepted as primary events in the development of AD. There is evidence to suggest that both COX-1 expression and COX-2 expression are changed in the brain of AD patients. However, the impact of COX-dependent mechanisms on synaptic dysfunction underlying the memory deficit is not fully elucidated. In the present study effects of non-selective NSAIDs (aspirin and sodium salicylate) on associated memory impairment as well as Abeta-mediated suppression of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus were examined. Abeta1-42 (5mug/mul) and ibotenic acid (5mug/mul) were injected bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus of rats and the spatial memory and long term potentiation (LTP) were assessed by water maze performance and in vivo field potential recording, respectively. Field excitatory post synaptic potentials (fEPSP) were recorded from stratum radiatum of area CA1 following Schaffer collateral stimulation. Behavioral study revealed that both sub-chronic high dose of sodium salicylate (SS) and chronic low dose of aspirin improved the spatial memory impairment of Abeta treated rats, however the effects of SS were lower than those of aspirin. Animals treated with SS and aspirin showed a significant decrease in escape latency (SS: F(1, 24)=15.85, p<0.01, aspirin: F(1, 22)=25.24, p<0.001, ANOVA). Furthermore, in probe test, animals treated with aspirin (p<0.05) but not SS (p>0.05) spent more time (one-way ANOVA) in target quadrant zone. Both applied drugs restored the suppression of fEPSP slope LTP that was induced by Abeta treatment (unpaired t-test, p<0.001). Aspirin showed a preventative effect also against Abeta-induced changes in LTP and memory task when applied before Abeta administration. Since aspirin and SS improved synaptic dysfunction, we can suggest that COX-dependent mechanisms may play a role in synaptic dysfunction in an experimental model of AD.",

We demonstrate that these mice develop a robust age-dependent motor phenotype and spatial reference memory deficits when bred to homozygosity, leading to a strongly reduced age of onset of behavioral symptoms. At postnatal day sixteen, abundant AbetaPP was detected in subiculum and cortical pyramidal neurons. From six weeks on, intraneuronal Abeta could be detected which was much more abundant in homozygous mice. The same gene-dosage effect was seen on memory and motor deficits. While at 2 months of age neither heterozygous nor homozygous 5XFAD mice show any neurological phenotype except for alterations in anxiety behavior, at 5 months they were clearly evident. Interestingly, despite abundant motor deficiencies, homozygous 5XFAD mice were able to perform the acquisition training of the Morris water maze task with no difference in the swimming performance between the groups. Therefore the aggravated spatial memory and spatial reference memory deficits of the homozygous mice correlated with the elevated soluble and insoluble Abeta levels. Homozygous 5XFAD mice represent a model with several advantages in comparison to the heterozygous mice, developing amyloid pathology much more rapidly together with a neurological phenotype. These advantages allow reducing the number of animals for Alzheimer's disease research.",

    "abstract": "Stem cell transplantation therapy is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of ischemic stroke, and several beneficial aspects have been reported. Similarly, in Alzheimer's disease (AD), stem cell therapy is expected to provide an efficient therapeutic approach. Indeed, the intracerebral transplantation of stem cells reduced amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and rescued memory deficits in AD model mice. Here, we show that intravenous transplantation of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMCs) improves cognitive function in two different AD mouse models, DAL and APP mice, and prevents neurodegeneration. GFP-positive BMMCs were isolated from tibiae and femurs of 4-week-old mice and then transplanted intravenously into DAL and APP mice. Transplantation of BMMCs suppressed neuronal loss and restored memory impairment of DAL mice to almost the same level as in wild-type mice. Transplantation of BMMCs to APP mice reduced Abeta deposition in the brain. APP mice treated with BMMCs performed significantly better on behavioral tests than vehicle-injected mice. Moreover, the effects were observed even with transplantation after the onset of cognitive impairment in DAL mice. Together, our results indicate that intravenous transplantation of BMMCs has preventive effects against the cognitive decline in AD model mice and suggest a potential therapeutic effect of BMMC transplantation therapy.",

Tau tangle aggregation in this region may develop concurrently with cortical Abeta deposition in preclinical AD, but the pathological relationship between tau and Abeta remains unclear. We used task-free fMRI with a focus on the medical temporal lobe, together with Abeta PET imaging, in cognitively normal elderly human participants. We found that cortical Abeta load was related to disrupted intrinsic functional connectivity of the perirhinal cortex, which is typically the first brain region affected by tauopathies in AD. There was no concurrent association of cortical Abeta load with cognitive performance or brain atrophy. These findings suggest that dysfunction in the medial temporal lobe may represent a very early sign of preclinical AD and may predict future memory loss.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) into amyloid oligomers and fibrils is pathologically linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, the inhibition of Abeta aggregation is essential for the prevention and treatment of AD, but the development of potent agents capable of inhibiting Abeta fibrillogenesis has posed significant challenges. Herein, we designed Ac-LVFFARK-NH2 (LK7) by incorporating two positively charged residues, R and K, into the central hydrophobic fragment of Abeta17-21 (LVFFA) and examined its inhibitory effect on Abeta42 aggregation and cytotoxicity by extensive physical, biophysical, and biological analyses. LK7 was observed to inhibit Abeta42 fibrillogenesis in a dose-dependent manner, but its strong self-assembly characteristic also resulted in high cytotoxicity. In order to prevent the cytotoxicity that resulted from the self-assembly of LK7, the peptide was then conjugated to the surface of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) to fabricate a nanosized inhibitor, LK7@PLGA-NPs. It was found that LK7@PLGA-NPs had little cytotoxicity because the self-assembly of the LK7 conjugated on the NPs was completely inhibited. Moreover, the NPs-based inhibitor showed remarkable inhibitory capability against Abeta42 aggregation and significantly alleviated its cytotoxicity at a low LK7@PLGA-NPs concentration of 20 mug/mL. At the same peptide concentration, free LK7 showed little inhibitory effect. It is considered that several synergetic effects contributed to the strong inhibitory ability of LK7@PLGA-NPs, including the enhanced interactions between Abeta42 and LK7@PLGA-NPs brought on by inhibiting LK7 self-assembly, restricting conformational changes of Abeta42, and thus redirecting Abeta42 aggregation into unstructured, off-pathway aggregates. The working mechanisms of the inhibitory effects of LK7 and LK7@PLGA-NPs on Abeta42 aggregation were proposed based on experimental observations. This work provides new insights into the design and development of potent NPs-based inhibitors against Abeta aggregation and cytotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Several proteins have been identified as amyloid forming in humans, and independent of protein origin, the fibrils are morphologically similar. Therefore, there is a potential for structures with amyloid seeding ability to induce both homologous and heterologous fibril growth; thus, molecular interaction can constitute a link between different amyloid forms. Intravenous injection with preformed fibrils from islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), proIAPP, or amyloid-beta (Abeta) into human IAPP transgenic mice triggered IAPP amyloid formation in pancreas in 5 of 7 mice in each group, demonstrating that IAPP amyloid could be enhanced through homologous and heterologous seeding with higher efficiency for the former mechanism. Proximity ligation assay was used for colocalization studies of IAPP and Abeta in islet amyloid in type 2 diabetic patients and Abeta deposits in brains of patients with Alzheimer disease. Abeta reactivity was not detected in islet amyloid although islet beta cells express AbetaPP and convertases necessary for Abeta production. By contrast, IAPP and proIAPP were detected in cerebral and vascular Abeta deposits, and presence of proximity ligation signal at both locations showed that the peptides were <40 nm apart. It is not clear whether IAPP present in brain originates from pancreas or is locally produced. Heterologous seeding between IAPP and Abeta shown here may represent a molecular link between type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer disease.",

It has been shown to disrupt cellular and synaptic functions, yet its effects on the function of the intact neocortical network remain unknown. Using in vivo intracellular and extracellular recordings, we measured ongoing activity of neocortical pyramidal cells during various arousal states in the rTg4510 mouse model of tauopathy, prior to significant cell death, when only a fraction of the neurons show pathological tau. In transgenic mice, membrane potential oscillations are slower during slow-wave sleep and under anesthesia. Intracellular recordings revealed that these changes are due to longer Down states and state transitions of membrane potentials. Firing rates of transgenic neurons are reduced, and firing patterns within Up states are altered, with longer latencies and inter-spike intervals. By changing the activity patterns of a subpopulation of affected neurons, pathological tau reduces the activity of the neocortical network.",

During the past decades the characterisation of these fibres has been widely studied in an attempt to further understand the nature of the related diseases and in an effort to develop treatments. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is one of the most commonly used techniques to identify these fibres, but requires the use of a radioactive staining agent. The procedure we report overcomes this drawback through simple addition of a fluorinated moiety to a short Amyloid beta sequence via solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). This method is synthetically straightforward, widely applicable to different aggregation-prone sequences and, above all, allows for stain-free TEM imaging with improved quality compared to standard imaging procedures. The presence of the fluorinated moiety does not cause major changes in the fibre structure or aggregation, but rather serves to dissipate the microscope's electron beam, thus allowing for high contrast and straightforward imaging by TEM.",

The study included 468 healthy older individuals (Clinical Dementia Rating scale [CDR] global scores of 0, above cutoff on the modified Mini-Mental State Examination and Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test) (mean [SD] age, 79.4 [3.6] years; age range, 75.0-93.8 years). All study participants and their study partners completed the self and partner CFIs annually. Individuals also underwent concurrent annual neuropsychological assessment and APOE genotyping. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The CFI scores between clinical progressors (CDR score, >=0.5) and nonprogressors (CDR score, 0) and between APOE epsilon4 carriers and noncarriers were compared. Correlations of change between the CFI scores and neuropsychological performance were assessed longitudinally. RESULTS: At 48 months, group differences between clinical progressors and non-progressors were significant for self (2.13, SE=0.45, P<.001), partner (5.08, SE=0.59, P<.001), and self plus partner (7.04, SE=0.83, P<.001) CFI total scores. At month 48, APOE epsilon4 carriers had greater progression than noncarriers on the partner (1.10, SE=0.44, P<.012) and self plus partner (1.56, SE=0.63, P<.014) CFI scores. Both self and partner CFI change were associated with longitudinal cognitive decline (self, rho=0.32, 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.46; partner, rho=0.56, 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.68), although findings suggest self-report may be more accurate early in the process, whereas accuracy of partner report improves when there is progression to cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Demonstrating long-term clinical benefit will be critical for the success of recently launched secondary prevention trials. The CFI appears to be a brief, but informative potential outcome measure that provides insight into functional abilities at the earliest stages of disease.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) with TAR-DNA binding protein of 43kDa (TDP-43) and other common age-related pathologies, dementia, probable Alzheimer disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitive domains in community-dwelling older subjects. METHODS: Diagnoses of dementia, probable AD, and MCI in 636 autopsied subjects from the Religious Order Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project were based on clinical evaluation and cognitive performance tests. HS was defined as severe neuronal loss and gliosis in the hippocampal CA1 and/or subiculum. The severity and distribution of TDP-43 were assessed, and other age-related pathologies were also documented. RESULTS: HS was more common in those aged >90 years (18.0%) compared to younger subjects (9.2%). HS cases commonly coexisted with TDP-43 pathology (86%), which was more severe (p < 0.001) in HS cases. Although HS also commonly coexisted with AD and Lewy body pathology; only TDP-43 pathology increased the odds of HS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.07-3.34). In logistic regression models accounting for age, TDP-43, and other common age-related pathologies, HS cases had higher odds of dementia (OR = 3.71, 95% CI = 1.93-7.16), MCI, and probable AD (OR = 3.75, 95% CI = 2.01-7.02). In linear regression models, including an interaction term for HS and TDP-43 pathology, HS with coexisting TDP-43 was associated with lower function in multiple cognitive domains, whereas HS without TDP-43 did not have statistically significant associations. TDP-43 without HS was separately related to lower episodic memory. INTERPRETATION: The combined roles of HS and TDP-43 pathology are significant factors underlying global cognitive impairment and probable AD in older subjects.",

    "title": "Fyn inhibition rescues established memory and synapse loss in Alzheimer mice.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Currently no effective disease-modifying agents exist for the treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD). The Fyn tyrosine kinase is implicated in AD pathology triggered by amyloid-ss oligomers (Asso) and propagated by Tau. Thus, Fyn inhibition may prevent or delay disease progression. Here, we sought to repurpose the Src family kinase inhibitor oncology compound, AZD0530, for AD. METHODS: The pharmacokinetics and distribution of AZD0530 were evaluated in mice. Inhibition of Asso signaling to Fyn, Pyk2, and Glu receptors by AZD0530 was tested by brain slice assays. After AZD0530 or vehicle treatment of wild-type and AD transgenic mice, memory was assessed by Morris water maze and novel object recognition. For these cohorts, amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, synaptic markers (SV2 and PSD-95), and targets of Fyn (Pyk2 and Tau) were studied by immunohistochemistry and by immunoblotting. RESULTS: AZD0530 potently inhibits Fyn and prevents both Asso-induced Fyn signaling and downstream phosphorylation of the AD risk gene product Pyk2, and of NR2B Glu receptors in brain slices. After 4 weeks of treatment, AZD0530 dosing of APP/PS1 transgenic mice fully rescues spatial memory deficits and synaptic depletion, without altering APP or Ass metabolism. AZD0530 treatment also reduces microglial activation in APP/PS1 mice, and rescues Tau phosphorylation and deposition abnormalities in APP/PS1/Tau transgenic mice. There is no evidence of AZD0530 chronic toxicity. INTERPRETATION: Targeting Fyn can reverse memory deficits found in AD mouse models, and rescue synapse density loss characteristic of the disease. Thus, AZD0530 is a promising candidate to test as a potential therapy for AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neurosyphilis is a neurological disease that involves infection of the central nervous system with Treponema pallidum. With increases in unsafe sexual behaviour, syphilis has re-emerged worldwide. To explore the amyloid and tau metabolism in neurosyphilis patients in different stages, the levels of Alzheimer-type biomarkers in general paresis (GP) and asymptomatic neurosyphilis (ANS) patients in comparison to patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal controls (NCs) were investigated. METHODS: beta-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Abeta42) and Abeta 1-40 (Abeta40), tau hyperphosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) and total tau (t-tau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits in 44 patients with GP, 10 patients with ANS, 45 patients with AD and 39 NCs. RESULTS: Alzheimer's disease patients had lower CSF Abeta42 levels combined with higher CSF t-tau and p-tau181 levels than other groups (all P < 0.001). The CSF Abeta42 levels decreased in GP compared to ANS and NCs (P < 0.001). CSF Abeta40, t-tau and p-tau181 levels were not different between the GP, ANS or NC groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our research has demonstrated that GP, ANS and AD patients are characterized by distinct patterns of the CSF biomarkers Abeta and tau. The distinct CSF Abeta pattern in GP suggests the existence of abnormal Abeta metabolism. Furthermore, different levels of CSF Abeta will be helpful for the differentiation between different stages of neurosyphilis.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) protein is the primary proteinaceous deposit found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Evidence suggests that Abeta plays a central role in the development of AD pathology. Here, we show in PC12 cells, Abeta impairs tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and its association with p75(NTR), p62, and TRAF6 induced by nerve growth factor. The ubiquitination and tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA was also found to be impaired in postmortem human AD hippocampus compared to control. Interestingly, the nitrotyrosylation of TrkA was increased in AD hippocampus and this explains why the phosphotyrosylation and ubiquitination of TrkA was impaired. In AD brain, the production of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), which cleaves proNGF, was reduced, thereby leading to the accumulation of pro-NGF and a decrease in the level of active NGF. TrkA signaling events, including Ras/MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways, are deactivated with Abeta and in the human AD hippocampus. Findings show that Abeta blocks the TrkA ubiquitination and downstream signaling similar to AD hippocampus. Cell survival and differentiation are essential for living organisms. We propose that under normal conditions, nerve growth factor (NGF) leads to Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) phosphorylation, ubiquitination and its association with p75(NTR), p62 and TRAF6, thereby promoting cell survival and differentiation. In diseased conditions such as Alzheimer's, proNGF leads to nitrotyrosylation of TrkA, thereby impairing its ubiquitination and downstream signaling which results in apoptosis.

At 18 months of age, 3x Tg-AD mice were sacrificed after either 3 weeks (short term) or 1 year (long term) of CDK5 knockdown. In short-term-treated animals, CDK5 knockdown reversed betaA aggregation in the hippocampi via inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta Ser9 and activation of phosphatase PP2A. In long-term-treated animals, CDK5 knockdown induced a persistent reduction in CDK5 and prevented betaA aggregation, but the effect on amyloid precursor protein processing was reduced, suggesting that yearly booster therapy would be required. These findings further validate CDK5 as a target for preventing or blocking amyloidosis in older transgenic mice.",

    "abstract": "Metal complexes are increasingly explored as imaging probes in amyloid peptide related pathologies. We report the first detailed study on the mechanism of interaction between a metal complex and both the monomer and the aggregated form of Abeta1-40 peptide. We have studied lanthanide(III) chelates of two PiB-derivative ligands (PiB=Pittsburgh compound B), L(1) and L(2), differing in the length of the spacer between the metal-complexing DO3A macrocycle (DO3A=1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-triacetic acid) and the peptide-recognition PiB moiety. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy revealed that they both bind to aggregated Abeta1-40 (KD =67-160 muM), primarily through the benzothiazole unit. HSQC NMR spectroscopy on the (15) N-labeled, monomer Abeta1-40 peptide indicates nonsignificant interaction with monomeric Abeta. Time-dependent circular dichroism (CD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and TEM investigations of the secondary structure and of the aggregation of Abeta1-40 in the presence of increasing amounts of the metal complexes provide coherent data showing that, despite their structural similarity, the two complexes affect Abeta fibril formation distinctly. Whereas GdL(1), at higher concentrations, stabilizes beta-sheets, GdL(2) prevents aggregation by promoting alpha-helical structures. These results give insight into the behavior of amyloid-targeted metal complexes in general and contribute to a more rational design of metal-based diagnostic and therapeutic agents for amyloid- associated pathologies.",

    "title": "COPS5 protein overexpression increases amyloid plaque burden, decreases spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta, and exacerbates learning and memory deficits in the mouse brain.",
    "abstract": "Brain accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide because of increased processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), resulting in loss of synapses and neurodegeneration, is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Therefore, the identification of molecules that regulate Abeta generation and those that cause synaptic damage is crucial for future therapeutic approaches for AD. We demonstrated previously that COPS5 regulates Abeta generation in neuronal cell lines in a RanBP9-dependent manner. Consistent with the data from cell lines, even by 6 months, COPS5 overexpression in APDeltaE9 mice (APDeltaE9/COPS5-Tg) significantly increased Abeta40 levels by 32% (p < 0.01) in the cortex and by 28% (p < 0.01) in the hippocampus, whereas the increases for Abeta42 were 37% (p < 0.05) and 34% (p < 0.05), respectively. By 12 months, the increase was even more robust. Abeta40 levels increased by 63% (p < 0.001) in the cortex and by 65% (p < 0.001) in the hippocampus. Similarly, Abeta42 levels were increased by 69% (p < 0.001) in the cortex and by 71% (p < 0.011) in the hippocampus. Increased Abeta levels were translated into an increased amyloid plaque burden both in the cortex (54%, p < 0.01) and hippocampus (64%, p < 0.01). Interestingly, COPS5 overexpression increased RanBP9 levels in the brain, which, in turn, led to increased amyloidogenic processing of APP, as reflected by increased levels of sAPPbeta and decreased levels of sAPPalpha. Furthermore, COPS5 overexpression reduced spinophilin in both the cortex (19%, p < 0.05) and the hippocampus (20%, p < 0.05), leading to significant deficits in learning and memory skills. Therefore, like RanBP9, COPS5 also plays a pivotal role in amyloid pathology in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are caused by beta-amyloid (Abeta) and alpha-synuclein (alphaS), respectively. Ample evidence suggests that these two pathogenic proteins are closely linked and have a synergistic effect on eliciting neurodegenerative disorders. However, the pathophysiological consequences of Abeta and alphaS coexistence are still elusive. Here, we show that large-sized alphaS oligomers, which are normally difficult to form, are readily generated by Abeta42-seeding and that these oligomers efficiently hamper neuronal SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion. The direct binding of the Abeta-seeded alphaS oligomers to the N-terminal domain of synaptobrevin-2, a vesicular SNARE protein, is responsible for the inhibition of fusion. In contrast, large-sized Abeta42 oligomers (or aggregates) or the products of alphaS incubated without Abeta42 have no effect on vesicle fusion. These results are confirmed by examining PC12 cell exocytosis. Our results suggest that Abeta and alphaS cooperate to escalate the production of toxic oligomers, whose main toxicity is the inhibition of vesicle fusion and consequently prompts synaptic dysfunction.",

METHODS: In a large cohort of CN individuals (n = 188), we measured the hippocampal volume and cortical thickness within independently defined AD signature regions. We cross-sectionally assessed the associations between AD signature cortical thinning or hippocampal atrophy with CSF biomarkers of tau (increased tau) and beta-amyloid (Abeta) (decreased Abeta42). We also examined the impact of AD signature cortical thinning or other biomarker changes (i.e., hippocampal atrophy, reduced CSF Abeta42, or increased CSF tau) on cognitive performance in CN individuals. RESULTS: Elevated CSF tau was associated with AD signature cortical thinning but not hippocampal atrophy. In contrast, decreased CSF Abeta42 was associated with hippocampal loss but not AD signature cortical thinning. In addition, AD signature cortical thinning was associated with lower visuospatial performance. Reduced CSF Abeta42 was related to poorer performance on episodic memory. CONCLUSIONS: Spatially distinct neurodegeneration is associated with Abeta and tau pathology in preclinical AD. Abeta deposition and AD signature cortical atrophy independently affect cognition in CN older individuals.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To gain insight into different cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) phenotypes and mechanisms, we investigated cortical superficial siderosis (CSS), a new imaging marker of the disease, and its relation with APOE genotype in patients with pathologically proven CAA, who presented with and without intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). METHODS: MRI scans of 105 patients with CAA pathologic confirmation and MRI were analyzed for CSS (focal, <=3 sulci; disseminates, >=4 sulci) and other imaging markers. We compared pathologic, imaging, and APOE genotype data between subjects with vs without ICH, and investigated associations between CSS and APOE genotype. RESULTS: Our cohort consisted of 54 patients with CAA with symptomatic lobar ICH and 51 without ICH. APOE genotype was available in 53 patients. More than 90% of pathology samples in both groups had neuritic plaques, whereas neurofibrillary tangles were more commonly present in the patients without ICH (87% vs 42%, p < 0.0001). There was a trend for patients with CAA with ICH to more commonly have APOE epsilon2 (48.7% vs 21.4%, p = 0.075), whereas patients without ICH were more likely to be APOE epsilon4 carriers (85.7% vs 53.9%, p = 0.035). Disseminated CSS was considerably commoner in patients with ICH (33.3% vs 5.9%, p < 0.0001). In logistic regression, disseminated CSS was associated with APOE epsilon2 (but not APOE epsilon4) (odds ratio 5.83; 95% confidence interval 1.49-22.82, p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: This neuropathologically defined CAA cohort suggests that CSS and APOE epsilon2 are related to the hemorrhagic expression of the disease; APOE epsilon4 is enriched in nonhemorrhagic CAA. Our study emphasizes the concept of different CAA phenotypes, suggesting divergent pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in humans, and a major public health concern with 35 million of patients worldwide. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers being early diagnostic indicators of AD, it is essential to use the most efficient analytical methods to detect and quantify them accurately. These biomarkers, and more specifically amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, are measured in routine clinical practice using immunoassays. However, there are several limits to this immunodetection in terms of specificity and multiplexing of the multiple isoforms of the Abeta peptides. To overcome these issues, the quantification of these analytes by mass spectrometry (MS) represents an interesting alternative, and several assays have been described over the past years. This article reviews the different Abeta peptides quantitative MS-based approaches published so far, compares their pre-analytical phase, and the different quantitative strategies implemented that might be suitable for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "While early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by a genetic mutation, the vast majority of late-onset AD is likely caused by the combination of genetic and environmental factors. Unlike genetic studies, potential environmental factors affecting AD pathogenesis have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Among environmental factors, pesticides seem to be one of critical environmental contributors to late-onset AD. Recent studies reported that the serum and brains of AD patients have dramatically higher levels of a metabolite of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). While these epidemiological studies provided initial clues to the environmental risks potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis, a functional approach is required to determine whether they actually have a causal role in disease development. In our study, we addressed this critical knowledge gap by investigating possible mechanisms by which DDT affects amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels. We treated H4-AbetaPPswe or H4 cells with DDT to analyze its effect on Abeta metabolism using Abeta production, clearance, and degradation assays. We found that DDT significantly increased the levels of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) and beta-site AbetaPP-cleaving enzyme1 (BACE1), affecting Abeta synthesis pathway in H4-AbetaPPswe cells. Additionally, DDT impaired the clearance and extracellular degradation of Abeta peptides. Most importantly, we identified for the first time that ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) are the downstream target genes adversely affected by DDT. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which DDT exposure may increase the risk of AD, and it further supports that ABCA1 and IDE may be potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "The plant alkaloid galantamine is an established symptomatic drug treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), providing cognitive and global relief in human patients. However, as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, gastrointestinal side effects limit the dosage and duration of treatment. Memogain (Gln-1062), a pro-drug, liberates galantamine on cleavage by a carboxyesterase in the brain. The possibility to deliver Memogain intranasally may further circumvent side effects, allowing higher dosing compared to galantamine. In this study, the 5X Familial Alzheimer's Disease (5XFAD) mouse model was used to investigate the effect of chronic Memogain treatment on behavior and amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque deposition in the brain. Chronic intranasal dosage of 6 mg/kg body weight twice daily was tolerated well, whereas the double dose caused body weight loss in males and was less effective in some behavioral tests. 8 weeks of chronic treatment resulted in improved performance in behavioral tests, such as open field and light-dark avoidance, and in fear conditioning already at mildly affected stages at the age of 18 weeks compared to untreated controls. Furthermore, after treatment a significantly lower plaque density in the brain, i.e., in the entorhinal cortex (reduction 20% females, 40% males) and the hippocampus (19% females, 31% males) at the age of 18 weeks was observed. These results show that nasal application of Memogain effectively delivers the drug to the brain with the potential to retard plaque deposition and improve behavioral symptoms in AD similar to the approved galantamine.",

    "title": "Amyloid-beta and Tau Dynamics in Human Brain Interstitial Fluid in Patients with Suspected Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta (Abeta1 - 42), total tau (T-tau), and phosphorylated tau (P-tau181) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are the most promising biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Still, little is known about the dynamics of these molecules in the living brain. In a transgenic mouse brain, soluble Abeta decreases with increasing age and advanced Abeta pathology as seen similarly in CSF. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between AD-related pathological changes in human brain tissue, ventricular and lumbar CSF, and brain interstitial fluid (ISF). METHODS: Altogether 11 patients with suspected idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus underwent frontal cortical brain biopsy, 24-h intraventricular pressure monitoring, and a microdialysis procedure. AD-related biomarkers were analyzed from brain tissue, CSF, and ISF. RESULTS: ISF T-tau levels decreased strongly within the first 12 h, then plateauing until the end of the experiment. Abeta1 - 42 and P-tau181 remained stable during the experiment (n = 3). T-tau and P-tau were higher in the ISF than in ventricular or lumbar CSF, while Abeta1 - 42 levels were within similar range in both CSF and ISF samples. ISF P-tau correlated with the ventricular CSF T-tau (r = 0.70, p = 0.017) and P-tau181 (r = 0.64, p = 0.034). Five patients with amyloid pathology in the brain biopsy tended to reveal lower ISF Abeta1 - 42 levels than those six without amyloid pathology. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report ISF Abeta and tau levels in the human brain without significant brain injury. The set-up used enables sampling from the brain ISF for at least 24 h without causing adverse effects due to the microdialysis procedure to follow the dynamics of the key molecules in AD pathogenesis in the living brain at various stages of the disease.",

To test this, we increased serum anti-ceramide IgG (2-fold) by ceramide administration and analyzed amyloid plaque formation in 5XFAD mice. There were no differences in soluble or total amyloid-beta levels. However, females receiving ceramide had increased plaque burden (number, area, and size) compared to controls. Ceramide-treated mice showed an increase of serum exosomes (up to 3-fold using Alix as marker), suggesting that systemic anti-ceramide IgG and exosome levels are correlated with enhanced plaque formation.",

The catabody dissolved preformed Abeta aggregates and inhibited Abeta aggregation more potently than an Abeta-binding IgG.

A greater than expected prevalence of incompletely penetrant HTT CAG repeat alleles observed among individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder raises the possibility that another mood disorder, bipolar disorder, could likewise be associated with Huntington's disease. METHODS: We assessed the distribution of HTT CAG repeat alleles in a cohort of individuals with bipolar disorder. HTT CAG allele sizes from 2,229 Caucasian individuals diagnosed with DSM-IV bipolar disorder were compared to allele sizes in 1,828 control individuals from multiple cohorts. RESULTS: We found that HTT CAG repeat alleles > 35 units were observed in only one of 4,458 chromosomes from individuals with bipolar disorder, compared to three of 3,656 chromosomes from control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These findings do not support an association between bipolar disorder and Huntington's disease.",

    "title": "Reversible redox modifications in the microglial proteome challenged by beta amyloid.",
    "abstract": "Microglia are resident macrophages in the central nervous system, whose participation against exogenous injuries and infections is mainly marked by an immediate release of inflammatory cytokines along with a toxic efflux of superoxide radicals. Indeed, many lines of evidence indicate that persistent activation of these cells turns their neuroprotective phenotype into a neurotoxic one, which contributes to destroy neuronal activity and induces neuronal loss in several neurodegeneration processes, such as Alzheimer's disease. In this study we attempted to fill-in the gap in our knowledge about redox regulation of amyloid activated microglia. With this aim, we carried out a robust and comprehensive characterization of the reversibly redox modified proteome both at the level of resting and amyloid-activated BV2 cells, an immortalised cell line of murine microglia. The approach we used combined the selective enrichment of reversible redox modified proteins through a biotin bait with nanoscale liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry of their proteolytic peptides. By this reliable approach, we identified 60 proteins changing the redox status of their selective cysteine residues upon treatment with the amyloidogenic Abeta25-35 peptide. These results assessed that in microglia stimulated by amyloids, redox modifications of the proteome specifically target proteins involved in crucial cell processes, i.e. those involved in the protein synthesis. In particular, for peroxiredoxin-6 (Prdx6) and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) we suggest mechanisms through which reversible redox modifications could affect the peculiar role of microglia in amyloidogenic injury, which at the same time reinforce the oxidative burst and resist toward it. Moreover, the redox modulation we observed on chloride intracellular channel protein 1 (CLIC1) strengthens the structural and functional relationship between the oxidative stress and the metamorphic transition of this protein from a soluble form to an integral membrane form. The redox signatures we determined might also provide neurologists with more specific and reliable biomarkers to distinguish the diverse microglia status in neurodegeneration and then to drive targeted drug design.",

Recent genome-wide association studies have shown that a rare R47H mutation of TREM2 correlates with a substantial increase in the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). To address the basis for this genetic association, we studied TREM2 deficiency in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. We found that TREM2 deficiency and haploinsufficiency augment beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation due to a dysfunctional response of microglia, which fail to cluster around Abeta plaques and become apoptotic. We further demonstrate that TREM2 senses a broad array of anionic and zwitterionic lipids known to associate with fibrillar Abeta in lipid membranes and to be exposed on the surface of damaged neurons. Remarkably, the R47H mutation impairs TREM2 detection of lipid ligands. Thus, TREM2 detects damage-associated lipid patterns associated with neurodegeneration, sustaining the microglial response to Abeta accumulation.",

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by early reductions in glucose transport associated with diminished GLUT1 expression at the BBB. Whether GLUT1 reduction influences disease pathogenesis remains, however, elusive. Here we show that GLUT1 deficiency in mice overexpressing amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) precursor protein leads to early cerebral microvascular degeneration, blood flow reductions and dysregulation and BBB breakdown, and to accelerated amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) pathology, reduced Abeta clearance, diminished neuronal activity, behavioral deficits, and progressive neuronal loss and neurodegeneration that develop after initial cerebrovascular degenerative changes. We also show that GLUT1 deficiency in endothelium, but not in astrocytes, initiates the vascular phenotype as shown by BBB breakdown. Thus, reduced BBB GLUT1 expression worsens Alzheimer's disease cerebrovascular degeneration, neuropathology and cognitive function, suggesting that GLUT1 may represent a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease vasculo-neuronal dysfunction and degeneration.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Multiple lines of evidence indicate that pathological accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide in the brain is linked to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Removal of Abeta from the brain by binding to anti-Abeta specific antibodies is under active investigation. Vaccination with a full-length Abeta42 peptide (AN1792) successfully elicited anti-Abeta antibodies in human subjects with AD, but was associated with meningoencephalitis. To avoid this safety issue, an aminoterminal Abeta1-7 peptide conjugate, vanutide cridificar (ACC-001), was designed and is currently in clinical development. This report describes two phase 2 multiple ascending-dose studies in Japanese subjects with mild to moderate AD. Safety and immunogenicity evaluation were the primary and secondary objectives, respectively. METHODS: ACC-001 was administered to three cohorts of subjects at doses of 3, 10, or 30 mug, with or without a QS-21 adjuvant in Study 1, and with a QS-21 adjuvant in Study 2; control groups consisted of QS-21 alone (both studies) and phosphate-buffered saline (Study 1 only). RESULTS: A variety of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported from most subjects during the studies; most of these were mild or moderate in intensity. Three subjects withdrew from the study because of an adverse event (in Study 2). The most common treatment-associated TEAE was injection site reactions. No deaths were observed in either study. All doses of ACC-001 + QS-21 elicited high, sustained anti-Abeta antibody titers; QS-21 was necessary for this effect. CONCLUSION: These data will provide valuable information on further investigation of anti-Abeta vaccine therapy for AD.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms that contribute to selective vulnerability of the magnocellular basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, are not fully understood. Because age is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, mechanisms of interest must include age-related alterations in protein expression, cell type-specific markers and pathology. The present study explored the extent and characteristics of intraneuronal amyloid-beta accumulation, particularly of the fibrillogenic 42-amino acid isoform, within basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in normal young, normal aged and Alzheimer's disease brains as a potential contributor to the selective vulnerability of these neurons using immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Amyloid-beta1-42 immunoreactivity was observed in the entire cholinergic neuronal population regardless of age or Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. The magnitude of this accumulation as revealed by optical density measures was significantly greater than that in cortical pyramidal neurons, and magnocellular neurons in the globus pallidus did not demonstrate a similar extent of amyloid immunoreactivity. Immunoblot analysis with a panel of amyloid-beta antibodies confirmed accumulation of high concentration of amyloid-beta in basal forebrain early in adult life. There was no age- or Alzheimer-related alteration in total amyloid-beta content within this region. In contrast, an increase in the large molecular weight soluble oligomer species was observed with a highly oligomer-specific antibody in aged and Alzheimer brains when compared with the young. Similarly, intermediate molecular weight oligomeric species displayed an increase in aged and Alzheimer brains when compared with the young using two amyloid-beta42 antibodies. Compared to cortical homogenates, small molecular weight oligomeric species were lower and intermediate species were enriched in basal forebrain in ageing and Alzheimer's disease. Regional and age-related differences in accumulation were not the result of alterations in expression of the amyloid precursor protein, as confirmed by both immunostaining and western blot. Our results demonstrate that intraneuronal amyloid-beta accumulation is a relatively selective trait of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons early in adult life, and increases in the prevalence of intermediate and large oligomeric assembly states are associated with both ageing and Alzheimer's disease. Selective intraneuronal amyloid-beta accumulation in adult life and oligomerization during the ageing process are potential contributors to the degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer's disease.",

However, the cell types and mechanisms underlying TREM2's involvement in neurodegeneration remain to be established. Here, we report that TREM2 is up-regulated on myeloid cells surrounding amyloid deposits in AD mouse models and human AD tissue. TREM2 was detected on CD45(hi)Ly6C(+) myeloid cells, but not on P2RY12(+) parenchymal microglia. In AD mice deficient for TREM2, the CD45(hi)Ly6C(+) macrophages are virtually eliminated, resulting in reduced inflammation and ameliorated amyloid and tau pathologies. These data suggest a functionally important role for TREM2(+) macrophages in AD pathogenesis and an unexpected, detrimental role of TREM2 in AD pathology. These findings have direct implications for future development of TREM2-targeted therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "AChE inhibitors are the first choice for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease (AD), but they could only delay the progression of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction, and fail to reverse neuronal damage. Calcium channel blockers have been identified to have protective effect on neurons. Thus, therapy targeting both AChE and calcium channels is supposed to be more effective in AD treatment. In the present study, we explored the effect of a synthesized juxtaposition of an AChE inhibitor and a Calcium channel blocker (named (-)SCR1693) on tau phosphophorylation and Abeta generation. The results showed that: (1) Compared with higher concentrations, (-)SCR1693 incubation in low concentrations such as 0.4, 2, 4muM for 24h did not affect the cell viability of HEK293/tau (HEK293 cells stably transfected with human tau40) and N2a/APP (N2a cells stably transfected with human APP) cells; (2) long-term treatment of cells with (-)SCR1693 (0.4, 2, 5muM) (24h) induced tau dephosphorylation and reduced the total tau level in HEK293/tau cells. Short-term treatment (6h) also resulted in tau dephosphorylation, but did not reduce the total tau level; and (3) (-)SCR1693 (0.4, 2, 4muM) incubation inhibited Abeta generation and release dramatically in N2a/APP cells. We conclude that the novel tacrine-dihydropyridine hybrid (-)SCR1693 in low concentrations could reduce total and phosphorylated tau levels, inhibit the generation and release of Abeta in cells. Thus, (-)SCR1693 may be a potential candidate for effectively treating AD.",

Metal ions play a pivotal role, acting as mediators of neurotoxicity either by favoring or redox cycling. Thus, they represent a promising and suitable therapeutic target for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the development of bifunctional or multifunctional molecules, which have antiaggregant and metal-chelating/antioxidant properties, may be considered as a valuable strategy for the treatment of neurodegeneration considering its multifactorial nature. Herein, we report the design and the characterization of four new multifunctional sugar-appended 8-hydroxyquinolines focusing on the effects of the conjugation with trehalose, a nonreducing disaccharide involved in the protection of proteins and cells against environmental stresses. These glycoconjugates do not exhibit any antiproliferative activity against three human cell lines of different histological origin, unlike 8-hydroxyquinolines. The multiple properties of the new derivatives are highlighted, reporting their Cu(2+) and Zn(2+) binding ability, and antioxidant and antiaggregant capacities.

    "abstract": "Aberrant cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by gamma-secretase contributes to the development of Alzheimer's disease. More than 200 disease-derived mutations have been identified in presenilin (the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase), making modulation of gamma-secretase activity a potentially attractive therapeutic opportunity. Unfortunately, the technical challenges in dealing with intact gamma-secretase have hindered discovery of modulators and demand a convenient substitute approach. Here we report that, similar to gamma-secretase, the archaeal presenilin homolog PSH faithfully processes the substrate APP C99 into Abeta42, Abeta40, and Abeta38. The molar ratio of the cleavage products Abeta42 over Abeta40 by PSH is nearly identical to that by gamma-secretase. The proteolytic activity of PSH is specifically suppressed by presenilin-specific inhibitors. Known modulators of gamma-secretase also modulate PSH similarly in terms of the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio. Structural analysis reveals association of a known gamma-secretase inhibitor with PSH between its two catalytic aspartate residues. These findings identify PSH as a surrogate protease for the screening of agents that may regulate the protease activity and the cleavage preference of gamma-secretase.",

Mutations in the Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) gene are the major cause of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). How PSEN1 mutations cause FAD is unclear, and pathogenic mechanisms based on gain or loss of function have been proposed. Here, we generated Psen1 knockin (KI) mice carrying the FAD mutation L435F or C410Y. Remarkably, KI mice homozygous for either mutation recapitulate the phenotypes of Psen1(-/-) mice. Neither mutation altered Psen1 mRNA expression, but both abolished gamma-secretase activity. Heterozygosity for the KI mutation decreased production of Abeta40 and Abeta42, increased the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio, and exacerbated Abeta deposition. Furthermore, the L435F mutation impairs hippocampal synaptic plasticity and memory and causes age-dependent neurodegeneration in the aging cerebral cortex. Collectively, our findings reveal that FAD mutations can cause complete loss of Presenilin-1 function in vivo, suggesting that clinical PSEN mutations produce FAD through a loss-of-function mechanism.",

Also, in aromatherapy the juniper volatile oil is used against anxiety, nervous tension and stress-related conditions. In the present study, we identified the effects of the juniper volatile oil on amyloid beta (1-42)-induced oxidative stress in the rat hippocampus. Rats received a single intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid beta (1-42) (400 pmol/rat) and then were exposed to juniper volatile oil (200 mul, either 1 or 3 %) for controlled 60 min period, daily, for 21 continuous days. Also, the antioxidant activity in the hippocampus was assessed using superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase specific activities, the total content of the reduced glutathione, protein carbonyl and malondialdehyde levels. Additionally, the acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus was assessed. The amyloid beta (1-42)-treated rats exhibited the following: increase of the acetylcholinesterase, superoxide dismutase and catalase specific activities, decrease of glutathione peroxidase specific activity and the total content of the reduced glutathione along with an elevation of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl levels. Inhalation of the juniper volatile oil significantly decreases the acetylcholinesterase activity and exhibited antioxidant potential. These findings suggest that the juniper volatile oil may be a potential candidate for the development of therapeutic agents to manage oxidative stress associated with Alzheimer's disease through decreasing the activity of acetylcholinesterase and anti-oxidative mechanism.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the plasma levels of amyloid beta (Abeta) and select inflammatory mediators in patients with various stages of AMD compared to that of age-matched controls, and discern a relationship to disease severity. METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from AMD subjects at various stages of disease-early (drusen only), geographic atrophy (GA), neovascular AMD (CNV)-and from controls of similar age without AMD. Samples were analyzed using a commercially available ELISA kit (sixteen cytokines) or LC/MS/MS (Abeta isotypes). Descriptive statistics were compiled on all analytes. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to compare each analyte across AMD groups while adjusting for sex and age of the patients, and in comparison to the control group. Receiver operating characteristics plots were generated for the strongest predictor variables. RESULTS: Levels of alternative spliced CC3 proteins were significantly different between controls and CNV groups (p < 0.05), with median levels almost twice higher in CNV than in controls. There was an increasing trend for plasma levels of Alphabeta isotypes across AMD progressive stages (p values ranged from 0.052 to 0.0012) (ANCOVA). When adjusted for multiple comparisons analysis, plasma Abeta 1-42 levels, and its ratio with Abeta 1-40 were the most significantly associated with late AMD stages. Consistently with the ANCOVA results for Alphabeta isotypes, the ROC curve showed a moderate prediction (AUC = - ~ 0.78) of AMD vs control using the Abeta 1-42 isotype. CONCLUSION: Plasma Abeta 1-42 may have utility as a systemic biomarker for AMD.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: In this article, we describe an image analysis strategy with improved power for tracking longitudinal amyloid-beta (Abeta) PET changes and evaluating Abeta-modifying treatments. METHODS: Our aims were to compare the power of template-based cerebellar, pontine, and cerebral white matter reference regions to track 24-mo florbetapir standardized uptake value (SUV) ratio (SUVR) changes; to relate those changes to 24-mo clinical declines; and to evaluate Abeta-modifying treatments in Abeta-positive (Abeta+) and Abeta-negative (Abeta-) patients with probable Alzheimer dementia (pAD), in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), in cognitively normal controls (NCs), and in cognitively normal apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) carriers and noncarriers. We used baseline and follow-up (~24 mo) florbetapir PET scans from 332 Abeta+ and Abeta- subjects participating in the multicenter Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Each of the proposed analyses included 31 pAD patients, 187 MCI patients, and 114 NCs. Cerebral-to-white matter, cerebellar, and pontine SUVRs were characterized in terms of their longitudinal variability; their power to track longitudinal fibrillar Abeta increases in Abeta+ and Abeta- subgroups and cognitively normal APOE4 carriers and noncarriers; the sample sizes needed to detect attenuated accumulation of or clearance of fibrillar Abeta accumulation in randomized clinical trials; and their ability to relate 24-mo fibrillar Abeta increases to clinical declines. RESULTS: As predicted, cerebral-to-white matter SUVR changes were significantly less variable and had significantly greater power to detect 24-mo fibrillar Abeta increases and evaluate Abeta-modifying treatment effects in Abeta+ pAD, MCI, and NC subjects and cognitively normal APOE4 carriers. They were also distinguished by the ability to detect significant associations between 24-mo Abeta increases and clinical declines. CONCLUSION: A cerebral white matter reference region may improve the power to track longitudinal fibrillar Abeta increases, to characterize their relationship to longitudinal clinical declines, and to evaluate Abeta-modifying treatments in randomized clinical trials.",

    "title": "Subjective Cognitive Complaints, Personality and Brain Amyloid-beta in Cognitively Normal Older Adults.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Subjective cognitive complaints in otherwise normal aging are common but may be associated with preclinical Alzheimer disease in some individuals. Little is known about who is mostly likely to show associations between cognitive complaints and preclinical Alzheimer pathology. We sought to demonstrate associations between subjective complaints and brain amyloid-beta in cognitively normal older adults; and to explore personality factors as potential moderators of this association. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Clinical neuroimaging research center. PARTICIPANTS: Community volunteer sample of 92 healthy older adults, screened for normal cognition with comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. MEASUREMENTS: Subjective cognitive self-report measures included the Memory Functioning Questionnaire (MFQ), Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, and the Subjective Cognitive Complaint Scale. Personality was measured with the NEO Five Factor Inventory. Brain amyloid-beta deposition was assessed with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET imaging. RESULTS: One of three cognitive complaint measures, the MFQ, was associated with global PiB retention (standardized beta = -0.230, p = 0.046, adjusting for age, sex and depressive symptoms). Neuroticism moderated this association such that only high neuroticism individuals showed the predicted pattern of high complaint-high amyloid-beta association. CONCLUSION: Evidence for association between subjective cognition and brain amyloid-beta deposition in healthy older adults is demonstrable but measure-specific. Neuroticism may moderate the MFQ-amyloid-beta association such that it is observed in the context of higher trait neuroticism. Subjective cognitive complaints and neuroticism may reflect a common susceptibility toward psychological distress and negative affect, which are in turn risk factors for cognitive decline in aging and incident Alzheimer disease.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibrillary tangles (aggregates of cytoskeletal Tau protein) and senile plaques (aggregates mainly formed by amyloid beta peptide) are two landmark lesions in Alzheimer s disease. Some researchers have proposed tangles, whereas others have proposed plaques, as primary lesions. For a long time, these were thought of as independent mechanisms. However, experimental evidence suggests that both lesions are intimately related. We review here some molecular pathways linking amyloid beta and Tau toxicities involving, among others, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, p38, Pin1, cyclin-dependent kinase 5, and regulator of calcineurin 1. Understanding amyloid beta and Tau toxicities as part of a common pathophysiological mechanism may help to find molecular targets to prevent or even treat the disease.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), however the effect of such neural damage on the onset and progression of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque pathology is not well understood. This study utilized an in vivo model of focal brain injury to examine how localized damage may acutely affect the onset and progression of Abeta plaque deposition as well as inflammatory and synaptic changes, in the APP/PS1 (APPSWE, PSEN1dE9) transgenic model of AD relative to wild-type (Wt) mice. Acute focal brain injury in 3- and 9-month-old APP/PS1 and Wt mice was induced by insertion of a needle into the somatosensory neocortex, as compared to sham surgery, and examined at 24h and 7d post-injury (PI). Focal brain injury did not induce thioflavine-S stained or (pan-Abeta antibody) MOAB-2-labeled plaques at either 24h or 7d PI in 3-month-old APP/PS1 mice or Wt mice. Nine-month-old APP/PS1 mice demonstrate cortical Abeta plaques but focal injury had no statistically significant (p>0.05) effect on thioflavine-S or MOAB-2 plaque load surrounding the injury site at 24h PI or 7d PI. There was a significant (p<0.001) increase in cross-sectional cortical area occupied by Iba-1 positive microglia in injured mice compared to sham animals, however this response did not differ between APP/PS1 and Wt mice (p>0.05). For both Wt and APP/PS1 mice alike, synaptophysin puncta near the injury site were significantly reduced 24h PI (compared to sites distant to the injury and the corresponding area in sham mice; p<0.01), but not after 7d PI (p>0.05). There was no significant effect of genotype on this response (p>0.05). These results indicate that focal brain injury and the associated microglial response do not acutely alter Abeta plaque deposition in the APP/PS1 mouse model. Furthermore the current study demonstrated that the brains of both Wt and APP/PS1 mice are capable of recovering lost synaptophysin immunoreactivity post-injury, the latter in the presence of Abeta plaque pathology that causes synaptic degeneration.",

    "abstract": "We have previously shown that 2-(3-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)ureido)acetate (KHG21834) attenuates amyloid beta(Abeta)25-35-induced apoptotic death and shows anti-inflammatory activity against Abeta25-35-induced microglial activation. However, antioxidative effects of KHG21834 against Abeta-induced oxidative stress have not yet been reported. In the present study, we investigated the antioxidative function of KHG21834 in primary cultured cortical neurons, to expand the potential therapeutic efficacy of KHG21834. Pretreatment with KHG21834 protected against Abeta-induced neuronal cell death and mitochondrial damage, and significantly restored GSH levels and the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase, and also suppressed the production of reactive oxygen species and protein oxidation. These results imply that KHG21834 may play a role in cellular defense mechanisms against Abeta-induced oxidative stress in cultured cortical neurons. Furthermore, KHG21834 significantly attenuated the effects of Abeta treatment on levels of NF-kappaB, beta-catenin, and GSK-3beta proteins in cortical neurons. Taken together, our results suggest that the antioxidant effects of KHG21834 may result at least in part from its ability to regulate the NF-kappaB, beta-catenin, and GSK-3beta signaling pathways. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that KHG21834 significantly attenuates Abeta25-35-induced oxidative stress in primary cortical neurons, and provides novel insights into KHG21834 as a possible therapeutic agent for the treatment of Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity involving oxidative stress.",

Moreover, in in vitro autoradiography, (99m)Tc-labeled complexes clearly detected beta-amyloid plaques on sections of brain tissue from transgenic mice, which confirmed the sufficient affinity of these tracers for Abeta plaques. However, these compounds did not show desirable properties in vivo, especially showing poor brain uptake (below 0.5% ID g(-1)), which will hinder the further development of these tracers as brain imaging agents.

In the present in-silico study, a congeneric series of 44 imaging agents, including 17 positron emission tomography (PET) and 27 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging agents, was utilized to understand the structural features required for having essential binding affinity against Abeta plaques. Here, 2D-quantitative structure-activity relationship (2D-QSAR) and group-based QSAR (G-QSAR) models have been developed using genetic function approximation (GFA) and validated using various statistical metrics. Both the models showed satisfactory performance signifying the reliability and robustness of the developed QSAR models. The vital information gained from both the QSAR models will be useful in developing new PET and SPECT imaging agents and also in predicting their binding affinity against Abeta plaques. The results of this study would be important in view of the widespread clinical applicability of the SPECT imaging agents, especially in the developing countries. In this study, we have also designed some imaging agents based on the information provided by the models. Some of these designed compounds were predicted to be similar to or more active than the most active imaging agents present in the original dataset.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxia played an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Hypoxia increased Abeta formation, then caused Alzheimer's disease. Calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) was involved in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, hormonal secretion and other physiological function. Increasing evidence supported CaSR might play a more prominent role in susceptibility to AD, but the role of CaSR in Abeta overproduction induced by hypoxia and its mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate whether CaSR mediated the overproduction of Abeta induced by hypoxia, immunoblot and immunochemistry were employed to determine the expression of CaSR and BACE1 in hippocampal neurons and tissue and Ca(2+) image system was used to measure [Ca(2+)]i in hippocampal neurons. The content of Abeta was detected with ELISA kits. Our research found that hypoxia increased the expression of CaSR in hippocampal neurons and tissue and [Ca(2+)]i in hippocampal neurons. Calhex 231, a selective blocher of CaSR, inhibited the increase in [Ca(2+)]i induced by hypoxia. Hypoxia or GdCl3, an agonist of CaSR, increased the expression of BACE1 in hippocampal neurons and tissue, but Calhex 231 or Xesto C (a selective inhibitor of IP3 receptor) partly prevented hypoxia-induced BACE1 overexpression. Hypoxia or GdCl3 increased the content of Abeta42 and Abeta40 in hippocampal tissue, however Calhex 231 or Xesto C prevented hypoxia-induced the overproduction of Abeta42 and Abeta40 partly. Based on the above data, we suggested that hypoxia increased [Ca(2+)]i by elevated CaSR expression to promote BACE1 expression, thereby resulting in the overproduction of Abeta42 and Abeta40.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate the protective effect of pratensein against cognitive impairment induced by amyloid beta (1-42) (Abeta1-42) in rats. Abeta1-42 peptide was injected bilaterally in the hippocampus of rat. Next, pratensein was administered orally for 3 weeks. Our findings demonstrated that treatment with pratensein ameliorated learning and memory deficits in Abeta1-42 rat model of AD. Pratensein treatment significantly attenuated neuronal degeneration and apoptosis in hippocampus. Moreover, the over-expression in IL-1beta and TNF-alpha as well as the extensive astrogliosis and microgliosis in hippocampus induced by Abeta1-42 were significantly reduced following administration of pratensein. Concomitantly, pratensein treatment significantly suppressed the activation of NF-kappaB in hippocampus. In addition, pratensein was able to increase the levels of synaptophysin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These results indicate that pratensein could significantly ameliorate Abeta1-42-induced spatial learning and memory impairment through reducing neuroinflammation via inhibition of glial activation and NF-kappaB activation, and restoring synapse and BDNF levels, suggesting that administration of pratensein could likely provide a therapeutic approach for AD.",

    "abstract": "The early oligomerization of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) has been shown to be an important event in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Designing small molecule inhibitors targeting Abeta oligomerization is one attractive and promising strategy for AD treatment. Here we used ion mobility spectrometry coupled to mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) to study the different effects of the molecular tweezers CLR01 and CLR03 on Abeta self-assembly. CLR01 was found to bind to Abeta directly and disrupt its early oligomerization. Moreover, CLR01 remodeled the early oligomerization of Abeta42 by compacting the structures of dimers and tetramers and as a consequence eliminated higher-order oligomers. Unexpectedly, the negative-control derivative, CLR03, which lacks the hydrophobic arms of the tweezer structure, was found to facilitate early Abeta oligomerization. Our study provides an example of IMS as a powerful tool to study and better understand the interaction between small molecule modulators and Abeta oligomerization, which is not attainable by other methods, and provides important insights into therapeutic development of molecular tweezers for AD treatment.",

    "title": "Sleep interacts with abeta to modulate intrinsic neuronal excitability.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Emerging data suggest an important relationship between sleep and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how poor sleep promotes the development of AD remains unclear. RESULTS: Here, using a Drosophila model of AD, we provide evidence suggesting that changes in neuronal excitability underlie the effects of sleep loss on AD pathogenesis. beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation leads to reduced and fragmented sleep, while chronic sleep deprivation increases Abeta burden. Moreover, enhancing sleep reduces Abeta deposition. Increasing neuronal excitability phenocopies the effects of reducing sleep on Abeta, and decreasing neuronal activity blocks the elevated Abeta accumulation induced by sleep deprivation. At the single neuron level, we find that chronic sleep deprivation, as well as Abeta expression, enhances intrinsic neuronal excitability. Importantly, these data reveal that sleep loss exacerbates Abeta-induced hyperexcitability and suggest that defects in specific K(+) currents underlie the hyperexcitability caused by sleep loss and Abeta expression. Finally, we show that feeding levetiracetam, an anti-epileptic medication, to Abeta-expressing flies suppresses neuronal excitability and significantly prolongs their lifespan. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings directly link sleep loss to changes in neuronal excitability and Abeta accumulation and further suggest that neuronal hyperexcitability is an important mediator of Abeta toxicity. Taken together, these data provide a mechanistic framework for a positive feedback loop, whereby sleep loss and neuronal excitation accelerate the accumulation of Abeta, a key pathogenic step in the development of AD.",

    "abstract": "Some of the pathological hallmarks of the Alzheimer's disease brain are senile plaques composed of insoluble amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) fibrils. However, much of the recent emphasis in research has been on soluble Abeta aggregates in response to a growing body of evidence that shows that these species may be more neurotoxic than fibrils. Within this subset of soluble aggregated Abeta are protofibrils and oligomers. Although each species has been widely investigated separately, few studies have directly compared and contrasted their physical properties. In this work, we examined well-recognized preparations of Abeta(1-42) oligomers and protofibrils with multiangle (MALS) and dynamic (DLS) light scattering in line with, or following, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Multiple SEC-MALS analyses of protofibrils revealed molecular weight (Mw) gradients ranging from 200 to 2600 kDa. Oligomeric Abeta species are generally considered to be a smaller and more nascent than protofibrils. However, oligomer Mw values ranged from 225 to 3000 kDa, larger than that for protofibrils. Root-mean-square radius (Rg) values correlated with the Mw trends with protofibril Rg values ranging from 16 to 35 nm, while oligomers produced one population at 40-43 nm with a more disperse population from 22 to 39 nm. Hydrodynamic radius (RH) measurements by DLS and thioflavin T fluorescence measurements indicated that protofibrils and oligomers had commonalities, yet electron microscopy revealed morphological differences between the two. SEC-purified Abeta(1-42) monomer at lower concentrations was slower to nucleate but formed protofibrils (1500 kDa) or soluble protofilaments (3000 kDa) depending on the buffer type. The findings from these studies shed new light on the similarities and differences between distinct soluble aggregated Abeta species.",

Hippocampal Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 concentrations and AT8-immunopositive neurofibrillary tangle density were not significantly different across the clinical groups. Greater cathepsin D expression was associated with global cognitive score and episodic memory score but not with mini mental state examination or advanced neuropathology criteria.

    "abstract": "To understand neuroinflammation-related gene regulation during normal aging and in sporadic Alzheimer disease (sAD), we performed functional genomics analysis and analyzed messenger RNA (mRNA) expression by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of 22 genes involved in neuroinflammation-like responses in the cerebral cortex of wild-type and APP/PS1 transgenic mice. For direct comparisons, mRNA expression of 18 of the same genes was then analyzed in the entorhinal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and frontal cortex area 8 of middle-aged human subjects lacking Alzheimer disease-related pathology and in older subjects with sAD pathology covering Stages I-II/0(A), III-IV/A-B, and V-VI/C of Braak and Braak classification. Modifications of cytokine and immune mediator mRNA expression were found with normal aging in wild-type mice and in middle-aged individuals and patients with early stages of sAD-related pathology; these were accompanied by increased protein expression of certain mediators in ramified microglia. In APP/PS1 mice, inflammatory changes coincided with beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition; increased levels of soluble oligomers paralleled the modified mRNA expression of cytokines and mediators in wild-type mice. In patients with sAD, regulation was stage- and region-dependent and not merely acceleration and exacerbation of mRNA regulation with aging. Gene regulation at first stages of AD was not related to hyperphosphorylated tau deposition in neurofibrillary tangles, Abeta plaque burden, concentration of Abeta1-40 (Abeta40) and Abeta1-42 (Abeta42), or fibrillar Abeta linked to membranes but rather to increased levels of soluble oligomers. Thus, species differences and region- and stage-dependent inflammatory responses in sAD, particularly at the initial stages, indicate the need to identify new anti-inflammatory compounds with specific molecular therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Melatonin is the hormone produced by the pineal gland known to regulate physiologic rhythms and to display immunomodulatory and neuroprotective properties. It has been reported that Alzheimer disease patients show impaired melatonin production and altered expression of the 2 G protein-coupled melatonin receptors (MTRs), MT1 and MT2, but the underlying mechanisms are not known. Here we evaluated whether this dysfunction of the melatonergic system is directly caused by amyloid beta peptides (Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42)). Abeta treatment of rat pineal glands elicited an inflammatory response within the gland, evidenced by the up-regulation of 52 inflammatory genes, and decreased the production of melatonin up to 75% compared to vehicle-treated glands. Blocking NF-kappaB activity prevented this effect. Exposure of HEK293 cells stably expressing recombinant MT1 or MT2 receptors to Abeta lead to a 40% reduction in [(125)I]iodomelatonin binding to MT1. ERK1/2 activation triggered by MTRs, but not by the beta2-adrenergic receptor, was markedly impaired by Abeta in HEK293 transfected cells, as well as in primary rat endothelial cells expressing endogenous MTRs. Our data reveal the melatonergic system as a new target of Abeta, opening new perspectives to Alzheimer disease diagnosis and therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "FE65 and FE65L1 are cytoplasmic adaptor proteins that bind a variety of proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein, and that mediate the assembly of multimolecular complexes. We previously reported that FE65/FE65L1 double knockout (DKO) mice display disorganized laminin in meningeal fibroblasts and a cobblestone lissencephaly-like phenotype in the developing cortex. Here, we examined whether loss of FE65 and FE65L1 causes ocular and muscular deficits, 2 phenotypes that frequently accompany cobblestone lissencephaly. Eyes of FE65/FE65L1 DKO mice develop normally, but lens degeneration becomes apparent in young adult mice. Abnormal lens epithelial cell migration, widespread small vacuole formation, and increased laminin expression underneath lens capsules suggest impaired interaction between epithelial cells and capsular extracellular matrix in DKO lenses. Cortical cataracts develop in FE65L1 knockout (KO) mice aged 16 months or more but are absent in wild-type or FE65 KO mice. FE65 family KO mice show attenuated grip strength, and the nuclei of DKO muscle cells frequently locate in the middle of muscle fibers. These findings reveal that FE65 and FE65L1 are essential for the maintenance of lens transparency, and their loss produce phenotypes in brain, eye, and muscle that are comparable to the clinical features of congenital muscular dystrophies in humans.",

We report two cell models in which we control the inherent toxicity of the core Tau fragment. These models demonstrate the properties of prion-like recruitment of full-length Tau into an aggregation pathway in which template-directed, endogenous truncation propagates aggregation through the core Tau binding domain. We use these in combination with dissolution of native PHFs to quantify the activity of Tau aggregation inhibitors (TAIs). We report the synthesis of novel stable crystalline leucomethylthioninium salts (LMTX ), which overcome the pharmacokinetic limitations of methylthioninium chloride. LMTX , as either a dihydromesylate or a dihydrobromide salt, retains TAI activity in vitro and disrupts PHFs isolated from AD brain tissues at 0.16 muM. The Ki value for intracellular TAI activity, which we have been able to determine for the first time, is 0.12 muM. These values are close to the steady state trough brain concentration of methylthioninium ion (0.18 muM) that is required to arrest progression of AD on clinical and imaging end points and the minimum brain concentration (0.13 muM) required to reverse behavioral deficits and pathology in Tau transgenic mice.",

We used repeated scanning ultrasound (SUS) treatments of the mouse brain to remove Abeta, without the need for any additional therapeutic agent such as anti-Abeta antibody. Spinning disk confocal microscopy and high-resolution three-dimensional reconstruction revealed extensive internalization of Abeta into the lysosomes of activated microglia in mouse brains subjected to SUS, with no concomitant increase observed in the number of microglia. Plaque burden was reduced in SUS-treated AD mice compared to sham-treated animals, and cleared plaques were observed in 75% of SUS-treated mice. Treated AD mice also displayed improved performance on three memory tasks: the Y-maze, the novel object recognition test, and the active place avoidance task. Our findings suggest that repeated SUS is useful for removing Abeta in the mouse brain without causing overt damage, and should be explored further as a noninvasive method with therapeutic potential in AD.",

One of the intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs), gamma-secretase, is also intimately implicated in Alzheimer's disease, a major neurodegenerative disease and leading cause of dementia. High-resolution crystal structural analyses have revealed that I-CLiPs harbor their active sites buried deeply in the membrane bilayer. Surprisingly, however, the key kinetic constants of these proteases, turnover number kcat and catalytic efficiency kcat/KM, are largely unknown. By investigating the kinetics of intramembrane cleavage of the Alzheimer's disease-associated beta-amyloid precursor protein in vitro and in human embryonic kidney cells, we show that gamma-secretase is a very slow protease with a kcat value similar to those determined recently for rhomboid-type I-CLiPs.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Prevention trials for neurodegenerative diseases use genetic or other risk marker tests to select participants but there is concern that this could involve coercive disclosure of unwanted information. This has led some trials to use blinded enrollment (participants are tested but not told of their risk marker status). We examined the ethics of blinded vs transparent enrollment using well-established criteria for assessing the ethics of clinical research. METHODS: Normative analysis applying 4 key ethical criteria-favorable risk-benefit ratio, informed consent, fair subject selection, and scientific validity-to blinded vs transparent enrollment, using current evidence and state of Alzheimer disease (AD) and other prevention trials. RESULTS: Current evidence on the psychosocial impact of risk marker disclosure and considerations of scientific benefit do not support an obligation to use blinded enrollment in prevention trials. Nor does transparent enrollment coerce or involve undue influence of potential participants. Transparent enrollment does not unfairly exploit vulnerable participants or limit generalizability of scientific findings of prevention trials. However, if the preferences of a community of potential participants would affect the rigor or feasibility of a prevention trial using transparent enrollment, then investigators are required by considerations of scientific validity to use blinded enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: Considerations of risks and benefits, informed consent, and fair subject selection do not require the use of blinded enrollment for AD prevention trials. Blinded enrollment in AD prevention trials may sometimes be necessary because of the need for scientific validity, not because it prevents coercion or undue influence.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of memory and cognitive abilities, and the appearance of amyloid plaques composed of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles formed of tau protein. It has been suggested that exercise might ameliorate the disease; here, we evaluated the effect of voluntary running on several aspects of AD including amyloid deposition, tau phosphorylation, inflammatory reaction, neurogenesis and spatial memory in the double transgenic APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mouse model of AD. We report that voluntary wheel running for 10 weeks decreased Abeta burden, Thioflavin-S-positive plaques and Abeta oligomers in the hippocampus. In addition, runner APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice showed fewer phosphorylated tau protein and decreased astrogliosis evidenced by lower staining of GFAP. Further, runner APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice showed increased number of neurons in the hippocampus and exhibited increased cell proliferation and generation of cells positive for the immature neuronal protein doublecortin, indicating that running increased neurogenesis. Finally, runner APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice showed improved spatial memory performance in the Morris water maze. Altogether, our findings indicate that in APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice, voluntary running reduced all the neuropathological hallmarks of AD studied, reduced neuronal loss, increased hippocampal neurogenesis and reduced spatial memory loss. These findings support that voluntary exercise might have therapeutic value on AD.",

    "title": "Differential Effects of Palmitoylethanolamide against Amyloid-beta Induced Toxicity in Cortical Neuronal and Astrocytic Primary Cultures from Wild-Type and 3xTg-AD Mice.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Considering the heterogeneity of pathological changes occurring in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a therapeutic approach aimed both to neuroprotection and to neuroinflammation reduction may prove effective. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) has attracted attention for its anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective properties observed in AD animal models. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: We evaluated the protective role of PEA against amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42) toxicity on cell viability and glutamatergic transmission in primary cultures of cerebral cortex neurons and astrocytes from the triple-transgenic murine model of AD (3xTg-AD) and their wild-type littermates (non-Tg) mice. RESULTS: Abeta42 (0.5 muM; 24 h) affects the cell viability in cultured cortical neurons and astrocytes from non-Tg mice, but not in those from 3xTg-AD mice. These effects were counteracted by the pretreatment with PEA (0.1 muM). Basal glutamate levels in cultured neurons and astrocytes from 3xTg-AD mice were lower than those observed in cultured cells from non-Tg mice. Abeta42-exposure reduced and increased glutamate levels in non-Tg mouse cortical neurons and astrocytes, respectively. These effects were counteracted by the pretreatment with PEA. By itself, PEA did not affect cell viability and glutamate levels in cultured cortical neurons and astrocytes from non-Tg or 3xTg-AD mice. CONCLUSION: The exposure to Abeta42 induced toxic effects on cultured cortical neurons and astrocytes from non-Tg mice, but not in those from 3xTg-AD mice. Furthermore, PEA exerts differential effects against Abeta42-induced toxicity in primary cultures of cortical neurons and astrocytes from non-Tg and 3xTg-AD mice. In particular, PEA displays protective properties in non-Tg but not in 3xTg-AD mouse neuronal cultured cells overexpressing Abeta.",

    "title": "Manipulations of amyloid precursor protein cleavage disrupt the circadian clock in aging Drosophila.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by severe cognitive deterioration. While causes of AD pathology are debated, a large body of evidence suggests that increased cleavage of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) producing the neurotoxic Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide plays a fundamental role in AD pathogenesis. One of the detrimental behavioral symptoms commonly associated with AD is the fragmentation of sleep-activity cycles with increased nighttime activity and daytime naps in humans. Sleep-activity cycles, as well as physiological and cellular rhythms, which may be important for neuronal homeostasis, are generated by a molecular system known as the circadian clock. Links between AD and the circadian system are increasingly evident but not well understood. Here we examined whether genetic manipulations of APP-like (APPL) protein cleavage in Drosophila melanogaster affect rest-activity rhythms and core circadian clock function in this model organism. We show that the increased beta-cleavage of endogenous APPL by the beta-secretase (dBACE) severely disrupts circadian behavior and leads to reduced expression of clock protein PER in central clock neurons of aging flies. Our data suggest that behavioral rhythm disruption is not a product of APPL-derived Abeta production but rather may be caused by a mechanism common to both alpha and beta-cleavage pathways. Specifically, we show that increased production of the endogenous Drosophila Amyloid Intracellular Domain (dAICD) caused disruption of circadian rest-activity rhythms, while flies overexpressing endogenous APPL maintained stronger circadian rhythms during aging. In summary, our study offers a novel entry point toward understanding the mechanism of circadian rhythm disruption in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is commonly associated with Alzheimer disease, but its physiological function remains unknown. Nav1.6 is a key determinant of neuronal excitability in vivo. Because mouse models of gain of function and loss of function of APP and Nav1.6 share some similar phenotypes, we hypothesized that APP might be a candidate molecule for sodium channel modulation. Here we report that APP colocalized and interacted with Nav1.6 in mouse cortical neurons. Knocking down APP decreased Nav1.6 sodium channel currents and cell surface expression. APP-induced increases in Nav1.6 cell surface expression were Go protein-dependent, enhanced by a constitutively active Go protein mutant, and blocked by a dominant negative Go protein mutant. APP also regulated JNK activity in a Go protein-dependent manner. JNK inhibition attenuated increases in cell surface expression of Nav1.6 sodium channels induced by overexpression of APP. JNK, in turn, phosphorylated APP. Nav1.6 sodium channel surface expression was increased by T668E and decreased by T668A, mutations of APP695 mimicking and preventing Thr-668 phosphorylation, respectively. Phosphorylation of APP695 at Thr-668 enhanced its interaction with Nav1.6. Therefore, we show that APP enhances Nav1.6 sodium channel cell surface expression through a Go-coupled JNK pathway.",

    "abstract": "beta-Sheet aggregates and amyloid fibrils rising from conformational changes of proteins are observed in several pathological human conditions. These structures are organized in beta-strands that can reciprocally interact by hydrophobic and pi-pi interactions. The amyloid aggregates can give rise to pathological conditions through complex biochemical mechanisms whose physico-chemical nature has been understood in recent times. This review focuses on the various classes of natural and synthetic small molecules able to act against beta-amyloid fibrillogenesis and toxicity that may represent new pharmacological tools in Alzheimer's diseases. Some peptides, named 'beta-sheet breaker peptides', are able to hamper amyloid aggregation and fibrillogenesis by interfering with and destabilizing the non native beta-sheet structures. Other natural compounds, like polyphenols or indolic molecules such as melatonin, can interfere with beta-amyloid peptide pathogenicity by inhibiting aggregation and counteracting oxidative stress that is a key hallmark in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: There has been considerable interest in both clinical and preclinical research about the role of phytochemicals in the reduction of risk for cancer in humans. The aim of this study was to determine the antineoplastic effects of Chlorella pyrenoidosa in experimental breast cancer in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: In this experiment, the antineoplastic effects of C. pyrenoidosa in the chemoprevention of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mammary carcinogenesis in female rats were evaluated. Chlorella powder was administered through diet at concentrations of 0.3% and 3%. The experiment was terminated 14 wk after carcinogen administration. At autopsy, mammary tumors were removed and prepared for histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. In vitro cytotoxicity assay, parameters of apoptosis, and proliferation after chlorella treatment in human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cells were carried out. RESULTS: Basic parameters of experimental carcinogenesis, mechanism of action (biomarkers of apoptosis, proliferation, and angiogenesis), chosen metabolic variables, and side effects after long-term chlorella treatment in animals were assessed. Chlorella at higher concentration suppressed tumor frequency by 61% (P < 0.02) and lengthened tumor latency by 12.5 d (P < 0.02) in comparison with the controls. Immunohistochemical analysis of rat tumor cells showed caspase-7 expression increase by 73.5% (P < 0.001) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 expression decrease by 19% (P = 0.07) after chlorella treatment. In a parallel in vitro study, chlorella significantly decreased survival of MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In chlorella-treated MCF-7 cells, a significant increase in cells having sub-G0/G1 DNA content and significant increase of early apoptotic and late apoptotic/necrotic cells after annexin V/PI staining assay were found. Decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential and increasing reactive oxygen species generation were observed in the chlorella-treated MCF-7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first report on the antineoplastic effects of C. pyrenoidosa in experimental breast cancer in vivo and in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Axonopathy is a common and early phase in neurodegenerative and traumatic CNS diseases. Recent work suggests that amyloid beta (Abeta) produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) may be a critical downstream mediator of CNS axonopathy in CNS diseases, particularly those associated with hypoxia. We critically tested this hypothesis in an adult retinal explant system that preserves the three-dimensional organization of the retina while permitting direct imaging of two cardinal features of early-stage axonopathy: axonal structural integrity and axonal transport capacity. Using this system, we found via pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion of APP that production of Abeta is a necessary step in structural compromise of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons induced by the disease-relevant stressor hypoxia. However, identical blockade of Abeta production was not sufficient to protect axons from associated hypoxia-induced reduction in axonal transport. Thus, Abeta mediates distinct facets of hypoxia-induced axonopathy and may represent a functionally selective pharmacological target for therapies directed against early-stage axonopathy in CNS diseases.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Modifiable vascular and lifestyle-related risk factors have been associated with dementia risk in observational studies. In the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER), a proof-of-concept randomised controlled trial, we aimed to assess a multidomain approach to prevent cognitive decline in at-risk elderly people from the general population. METHODS: In a double-blind randomised controlled trial we enrolled individuals aged 60-77 years recruited from previous national surveys. Inclusion criteria were CAIDE (Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia) Dementia Risk Score of at least 6 points and cognition at mean level or slightly lower than expected for age. We randomly assigned participants in a 1:1 ratio to a 2 year multidomain intervention (diet, exercise, cognitive training, vascular risk monitoring), or a control group (general health advice). Computer-generated allocation was done in blocks of four (two individuals randomly allocated to each group) at each site. Group allocation was not actively disclosed to participants and outcome assessors were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was change in cognition as measured through comprehensive neuropsychological test battery (NTB) Z score. Analysis was by modified intention to treat (all participants with at least one post-baseline observation). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01041989. FINDINGS: Between Sept 7, 2009, and Nov 24, 2011, we screened 2654 individuals and randomly assigned 1260 to the intervention group (n=631) or control group (n=629). 591 (94%) participants in the intervention group and 599 (95%) in the control group had at least one post-baseline assessment and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. Estimated mean change in NTB total Z score at 2 years was 0 20 (SE 0 02, SD 0 51) in the intervention group and 0 16 (0 01, 0 51) in the control group. Between-group difference in the change of NTB total score per year was 0 022 (95% CI 0 002-0 042, p=0 030). 153 (12%) individuals dropped out overall. Adverse events occurred in 46 (7%) participants in the intervention group compared with six (1%) participants in the control group; the most common adverse event was musculoskeletal pain (32 [5%] individuals for intervention vs no individuals for control). INTERPRETATION: Findings from this large, long-term, randomised controlled trial suggest that a multidomain intervention could improve or maintain cognitive functioning in at-risk elderly people from the general population.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide aggregation and cholinergic neurodegeneration. Therefore, in this paper, we examined silibinin, a flavonoid extracted from Silybum marianum, to determine its potential as a dual inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Abeta peptide aggregation for AD treatment. To achieve this, we used molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to examine the affinity of silibinin with Abeta and AChE in silico. Next, we used circular dichroism and transmission electron microscopy to study the anti-Abeta aggregation capability of silibinin in vitro. Moreover, a Morris Water Maze test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine double labeling, and a gene gun experiment were performed on silibinin-treated APP/PS1 transgenic mice. In molecular dynamics simulations, silibinin interacted with Abeta and AChE to form different stable complexes. After the administration of silibinin, AChE activity and Abeta aggregations were down-regulated, and the quantity of AChE also decreased. In addition, silibinin-treated APP/PS1 transgenic mice had greater scores in the Morris Water Maze. Moreover, silibinin could increase the number of newly generated microglia, astrocytes, neurons, and neuronal precursor cells. Taken together, these data suggest that silibinin could act as a dual inhibitor of AChE and Abeta peptide aggregation, therefore suggesting a therapeutic strategy for AD treatment.",

However, the critical target to prevent Abeta-induced axonal degeneration remains unknown. Here, we analyzed growth cone collapse elicited by Abeta, a putative early Abeta-induced event in axons. Although no study has yet shown influence of Abeta on the growth cone, we first visualized Abeta-initiated growth cone collapse in cultured neurons. Furthermore, we determined that the collapse was triggered by clathrin-mediated endocytosis probably via Abeta-Ca(2+) signaling. The inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis prevented Abeta-induced axonal loss both in vitro and in vivo and prevented memory impairment in an AD mouse model. Our results clarified the important role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in Abeta-induced collapse of growth cone that leads to axonal degeneration and memory impairment.",

The molecular effect of these variants may be subtle and difficult to analyze with standard in vitro or in vivo models. Here we used hIPSCs to examine genetic variation in the SORL1 gene and possible contributions to SAD-related phenotypes in human neurons. We found that human neurons carrying SORL1 variants associated with an increased SAD risk show a reduced response to treatment with BDNF, at the level of both SORL1 expression and APP processing. shRNA knockdown of SORL1 demonstrates that the differences in BDNF-induced APP processing between genotypes are dependent on SORL1 expression. We propose that the variation in SORL1 expression induction by BDNF is modulated by common genetic variants and can explain how genetic variation in this one locus can contribute to an individual's risk of developing SAD.",

    "abstract": "Beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques and chronic neuroinflammation are significant neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease. Microglial cells in aged brains have potential to produce cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 family members (IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-1Ra) and to phagocytose Abeta in Alzheimer's disease, however the inter-relationship between these processes is poorly understood. Here we show that % Abeta plaque load followed a sigmoidal trajectory with age in the neocortex of APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 Tg mice, and correlated positively with soluble Abeta40 and Abeta42. Abeta measures were moderately correlated with mRNA levels of CD11b, TNF, and IL-1Ra. Cytokine production and Abeta load were assessed in neocortical CD11b(+)(CD45(+)) microglia by flow cytometry. Whereas most microglia in aged mice produced IL-1Ra, relatively low proportions of microglia produced TNF, IL-1alpha, and IL-1beta. However, microglial production of these latter cytokines was generally increased in APP/PS1 Tg mice. Microglia that phagocytosed endogenously-produced Abeta were only observed in APP/PS1 Tg mice. Differences in phagocytic index and total Abeta load were observed in microglia with specific cytokine profiles. Both phagocytic index and total Abeta load were higher in IL-1alpha(+) and IL-1Ra(+) microglia, than microglia that did not produce these cytokines. In contrast, total Abeta load was lower in IL-1beta(+) and TNF(+) microglia, compared to IL-1beta(-) and TNF(-) microglia, and TNF(+) microglia also had a lower phagocytic index. Using GFP bone marrow chimeric mice, we confirmed that the majority of neocortical CD11b(+)(CD45(+)) microglia were resident cells (GFP(-)) in APP/PS1 Tg mice, even after selectively analysing CD11b(+)CD45(high) cells, which are typically considered to be infiltrating cells. Together, our data demonstrate that cytokine expression is selectively correlated with age and Abeta pathology, and is associated with an altered Abeta load in phagocytic microglia from APP/PS1 Tg mice. These findings have implications for understanding the regulation of microglial cytokine production and phagocytosis of Abeta in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Predicting Reduction of Cerebrospinal Fluid beta-Amyloid 42 in Cognitively Healthy Controls.",
    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Alzheimer disease has a long preclinical stage characterized by beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation without symptoms. Several trials focus on this stage and use biomarkers to include Abeta-positive participants, but an even earlier prevention of Abeta accumulation may be an effective treatment strategy. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether people who appear to be Abeta negative but are at high risk for Abeta positivity within the near future can be identified. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal biomarker cohort study involving 35 cognitively healthy individuals who underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling for up to 3 years during the study (October 24, 2005, to September 1, 2014). All participants had normal CSF Abeta42 levels at baseline. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Predictors of future Abeta positivity (levels of CSF Abeta42 declining below a previously validated cutoff level of 192 ng/L) tested by random forest models. Tested predictors included levels of protein in the CSF, hippocampal volume, genetics, demographics, and cognitive scores. RESULTS: The CSF Abeta42 levels declined in 11 participants, and the CSF became Abeta positive. The baseline CSF Abeta42 level was a strong predictor of future positivity (accuracy, 79% [95% CI, 70%-87%]). Ten of 11 decliners had baseline CSF Abeta42 levels in the lower tertile of the reference range (<225 ng/L), and 22 of 24 nondecliners had baseline CSF Abeta42 levels in the upper 2 tertiles (>=225 ng/L). A high CSF P-tau level was associated with decline (accuracy, 68%; 95% CI, 55%-81%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Baseline CSF Abeta42 levels in the lower part of the reference range are strongly associated with future Abeta positivity. This finding can be used in trials on very early prevention of Alzheimer disease to identify people at high risk for Abeta accumulation as defined by low CSF Abeta42 levels.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta), which likely contributes to disease via multiple mechanisms. Increasing evidence implicates inflammation in AD, the origins of which are not completely understood. We investigated whether circulating Abeta could initiate inflammation in AD via the plasma contact activation system. This proteolytic cascade is triggered by the activation of the plasma protein factor XII (FXII) and leads to kallikrein-mediated cleavage of high molecular-weight kininogen (HK) and release of proinflammatory bradykinin. Abeta has been shown to promote FXII-dependent cleavage of HK in vitro. In addition, increased cleavage of HK has been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with AD. Here, we show increased activation of FXII, kallikrein activity, and HK cleavage in AD patient plasma. Increased contact system activation is also observed in AD mouse model plasma and in plasma from wild-type mice i.v. injected with Abeta42. Our results demonstrate that Abeta42-mediated contact system activation can occur in the AD circulation and suggest new pathogenic mechanisms, diagnostic tests, and therapies for AD.",

Our previous study indicated that PEG-PEI/siROCK2 could effectively suppress ROCK2 mRNA expression and showed a promising prospect for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, the ability of PEG-PEI/siROCK2 to reduce Abeta-induced cytotoxicity is unknown. To investigate the effect of PEG-PEI/siROCK2 against Abeta42-induced neurotoxicity, primary cultured cortical neurons were pretreated with PEG-PEI/siROCK2 for 24 h and then treated with 5 muM Abeta42 for 24 h. We found that PEG-PEI/siROCK2 increased the cell viability and reduced the number of apoptotic cells induced by Abeta42, as measured using an MTT assay and Annexin V/PI staining. A further study revealed that PEG-PEI/siROCK2 can activate p-Akt, and treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 attenuated the neuroprotective effects. These results suggest that PEG-PEI/siROCK2 prevents Abeta42-induced neurotoxicity and that the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in neuroprotection. Taken together, these findings shed light on the role of PEG-PEI/siROCK2 as a potential therapeutic agent for AD.",

OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of correlation between biomarkers in CSF and cognitive performance in populations with AD and FTD. METHODS: 27 patients with AD and 16 with FTD were included. CSF tau, P-tau(181P), Abeta42, and progranulin (PGRN) were measured and a standardized neuropsychological test battery applied. Olfactory testing was additionally included where available. RESULTS: For all patients across both groups, an association between PGRN and categoric (p = 0.016) and letter fluency (p = 0.029), naming (p = 0.003), and overall cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination: p = 0.04) was observed. Abeta42 was strongly associated with memory function (learning: p = 0.001; recall: p = 0.002). A correlation between Abeta42 and memory performance was moreover found for each group separately, while PGRN also showed a correlation with recognition memory (p = 0.04) in AD. Furthermore, an association between reduced PGRN and olfactory dysfunction was revealed (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: CSF-levels of PGRN and Abeta42 levels express deficits in cognition differentially, with PGRN being predominantly associated with frontal and Abeta42 with temporal dysfunction. This mirrors the cerebral occurrence of these proteins. These associations appear to be consistent across both disease groups. The relationship between PGRN and olfaction further underpins the association between PRGN and frontal dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "APOE e4, the most significant genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD), may mask effects of other loci. We re-analyzed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) Consortium in APOE e4+ (10 352 cases and 9207 controls) and APOE e4- (7184 cases and 26 968 controls) subgroups as well as in the total sample testing for interaction between a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and APOE e4 status. Suggestive associations (P<1 x 10(-4)) in stage 1 were evaluated in an independent sample (stage 2) containing 4203 subjects (APOE e4+: 1250 cases and 536 controls; APOE e4-: 718 cases and 1699 controls). Among APOE e4- subjects, novel genome-wide significant (GWS) association was observed with 17 SNPs (all between KANSL1 and LRRC37A on chromosome 17 near MAPT) in a meta-analysis of the stage 1 and stage 2 data sets (best SNP, rs2732703, P=5 8 x 10(-9)). Conditional analysis revealed that rs2732703 accounted for association signals in the entire 100-kilobase region that includes MAPT. Except for previously identified AD loci showing stronger association in APOE e4+ subjects (CR1 and CLU) or APOE e4- subjects (MS4A6A/MS4A4A/MS4A6E), no other SNPs were significantly associated with AD in a specific APOE genotype subgroup. In addition, the finding in the stage 1 sample that AD risk is significantly influenced by the interaction of APOE with rs1595014 in TMEM106B (P=1 6 x 10(-7)) is noteworthy, because TMEM106B variants have previously been associated with risk of frontotemporal dementia. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis revealed that rs113986870, one of the GWS SNPs near rs2732703, is significantly associated with four KANSL1 probes that target transcription of the first translated exon and an untranslated exon in hippocampus (P <= 1.3 x 10(-8)), frontal cortex (P <= 1.3 x 10(-9)) and temporal cortex (P<=1.2 x 10(-11)). Rs113986870 is also strongly associated with a MAPT probe that targets transcription of alternatively spliced exon 3 in frontal cortex (P=9.2 x 10(-6)) and temporal cortex (P=2.6 x 10(-6)). Our APOE-stratified GWAS is the first to show GWS association for AD with SNPs in the chromosome 17q21.31 region. Replication of this finding in independent samples is needed to verify that SNPs in this region have significantly stronger effects on AD risk in persons lacking APOE e4 compared with persons carrying this allele, and if this is found to hold, further examination of this region and studies aimed at deciphering the mechanism(s) are warranted.",

    "title": "Is anatomic complexity associated with renal tumor growth kinetics under active surveillance?",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Linear growth rate (LGR) is the most commonly employed trigger for definitive intervention in patients with renal masses managed with an initial period of active surveillance (AS). Using our institutional cohort, we explored the association between tumor anatomic complexity at presentation and LGR in patients managed with AS. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Enhancing renal masses managed expectantly for at least 6 months were included for analysis. The association between Nephrometry Score and LGR was assessed using generalized estimating equations, adjusting for the age, Charlson score, race, sex, and initial tumor size. RESULTS: Overall, 346 patients (401 masses) met the inclusion criteria (18% >= cT1b), with a median follow-up of 37 months (range: 6-169). Of these, 44% patients showed progression to definitive intervention with a median duration of 27 months (range: 6-130). On comparing patients managed expectantly to those requiring intervention, no difference was seen in median tumor size at presentation (2.2 vs. 2.2 cm), whereas significant differences in median age (74 vs. 65 y, P < 0.001), Charlson comorbidity score (3 vs. 2, P<0.001), and average LGR (0.23 vs. 0.49 cm/y, P < 0.001) were observed between groups. Following adjustment, for each 1-point increase in Nephrometry Score sum, the average tumor LGR increased by 0.037 cm/y (P = 0.002). Of the entire cohort, 6 patients (1.7%) showed progression to metastatic disease. CONCLUSIONS: The demonstrated association between anatomic tumor complexity at presentation and renal masses of LGR of clinical stage 1 under AS may afford a clinically useful cue to tailor individual patient radiographic surveillance schedules and warrants further evaluation.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the physical activity of working residents of Warsaw aged 20-69 years, as well as to identify the socio-demographic factors associated with their levels of physical activity. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The study involved 2,544 working residents of Warsaw aged 20-69 years. The short version of the IPAQ was applied and four physical activity levels (insufficient, sufficient, augmented, high) were distinguished. The relationships between physical activity and gender, age, BMI, education, economic and martial status as well as participation in recreation were determined. RESULTS: High levels of physical activity were reached by 8% of respondents, 22% achieved augmented level, 32% were sufficiently and 32% insufficiently active. Out of 2544 studied subjects, 6% declared complete sedentariness. Females were, as compared to males, more frequently (p<0.05) insufficiently active (35.9 vs. 31.9%). In obese and overweight subjects insufficient physical activity predominated (42.9 and 36.2%, respectively) and was significantly more frequent than in subjects with normal BMI (31.0%). Moreover, the subjects living in partner relationships were significantly (p<0.05) more frequently insufficiently active than those staying single (36.3 vs. 30.3%). Respondents who declared regular participation in leisure activities were less frequently insufficiently active (20.0%) and more frequently met the criteria of sufficient (37.6%), augmented (28.0%) or high (14.4%) level of physical activity. No significant effects were found with respect to education of respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic schedules associated with the improvement of physical activity level should be addressed particularly to females, people taking up recreation occasionally or to those not involved in recreation at all, living in partner relationships, youngest (21-30 years), in obese and overweight and in the lowest economic category.",

    "abstract": "One method for demonstrating disease modification is a delayed-start design, consisting of a placebo-controlled period followed by a delayed-start period wherein all patients receive active treatment. To address methodological issues in previous delayed-start approaches, we propose a new method that is robust across conditions of drug effect, discontinuation rates, and missing data mechanisms. We propose a modeling approach and test procedure to test the hypothesis of noninferiority, comparing the treatment difference at the end of the delayed-start period with that at the end of the placebo-controlled period. We conducted simulations to identify the optimal noninferiority testing procedure to ensure the method was robust across scenarios and assumptions, and to evaluate the appropriate modeling approach for analyzing the delayed-start period. We then applied this methodology to Phase 3 solanezumab clinical trial data for mild Alzheimer's disease patients. Simulation results showed a testing procedure using a proportional noninferiority margin was robust for detecting disease-modifying effects; conditions of high and moderate discontinuations; and with various missing data mechanisms. Using all data from all randomized patients in a single model over both the placebo-controlled and delayed-start study periods demonstrated good statistical performance. In analysis of solanezumab data using this methodology, the noninferiority criterion was met, indicating the treatment difference at the end of the placebo-controlled studies was preserved at the end of the delayed-start period within a pre-defined margin. The proposed noninferiority method for delayed-start analysis controls Type I error rate well and addresses many challenges posed by previous approaches. Delayed-start studies employing the proposed analysis approach could be used to provide evidence of a disease-modifying effect. This method has been communicated with FDA and has been successfully applied to actual clinical trial data accrued from the Phase 3 clinical trials of solanezumab.",

    "abstract": "Patients with diabetes mellitus have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-beta, a product of amyloid precursor protein, is associated with neuro-inflammation in patients with Alzheimer's diseases. The correlation between amyloid-beta and advanced glycation end products, which accumulate in tissue of diabetic patients, is not clear. The aims of this study were to determine the effect of advanced glycation end product on the expression of amyloid precursor protein/amyloid-beta and associated pro-inflammatory responses in retinal ganglion cell line RGC-5. Treatment with advanced glycation end product produced upregulation of amyloid precursor protein and increased secretion of amyloid-beta(1-40). Additionally, amyloid-beta(1-40) induced toll-like receptor 4-dependent phosphorylation of tyrosine in myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88). We found that N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester, a gamma-secretase inhibitor, reduced the secretion of amyloid-beta(1-40) and inhibited the advanced glycation end product-induced activation of myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88). Amyloid-beta(1-40) induced the activation of NF-kappaB and the expression of TNFalpha mRNA. Knockdown of toll-like receptor 4 inhibited the amyloid-beta(1-40)-induced phosphorylation of p65 in NF-kappaB. Additionally, the nuclear translocation of p65 and transcriptions of TNFalpha were inhibited by siRNA knockdown of receptor of advanced glycation end product or toll-like receptor 4. The advanced glycation end product-induced secretion of VEGF-A was also reduced by knockdown of toll-like receptor 4. Taken together, our data suggested that amyloid-beta(1-40) mediates the interaction between receptor of advanced glycation end product and toll-like receptor 4. Inhibition of the toll-like receptor 4 is an effective method for suppressing the amyloid-beta(1-40)-induced pro-inflammatory responses in RGC-5 cells.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein D (apoD) is expressed in the brain and levels are increased in affected brain regions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The role that apoD may play in regulating AD pathology has not been addressed. Here, we crossed both apoD-null mice and Thy-1 human apoD transgenic mice with APP-PS1 amyloidogenic AD mice. Loss of apoD resulted in a nearly 2-fold increase in hippocampal amyloid plaque load, as assessed by immunohistochemical staining. Conversely, transgenic expression of neuronal apoD reduced hippocampal plaque load by approximately 35%. This latter finding was associated with a 60% decrease in amyloid beta 1-40 peptide levels, and a 34% decrease in insoluble amyloid beta 1-42 peptide. Assessment of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) levels and proteolytic products of amyloid precursor protein and neuregulin-1 point toward a possible association of altered BACE1 activity in association with altered apoD levels. In conclusion, the current studies provide clear evidence that apoD regulates amyloid plaque pathology in a mouse model of AD.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis is not restricted to the neuronal compartment, but includes strong interactions with immunological mechanisms in the brain. Misfolded and aggregated proteins bind to pattern recognition receptors on microglia and astroglia, and trigger an innate immune response characterised by release of inflammatory mediators, which contribute to disease progression and severity. Genome-wide analysis suggests that several genes that increase the risk for sporadic Alzheimer's disease encode factors that regulate glial clearance of misfolded proteins and the inflammatory reaction. External factors, including systemic inflammation and obesity, are likely to interfere with immunological processes of the brain and further promote disease progression. Modulation of risk factors and targeting of these immune mechanisms could lead to future therapeutic or preventive strategies for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the fundamental relationships between cervical intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration, endplate calcification, and the patency of endplate marrow contact channels (MCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty cervical IVDs were excised from 30 human cadavers. After sectioning the specimens underwent micro computed tomography (microCT) - from all images the number, calibre, diameter and distribution of endplate openings were measured using ImageJ. Next, the specimens were scored for macroscopic degeneration (Thompson's classification), and subsequently underwent histological analysis for both IVD and endplate degeneration (Boos's classification) and calcification. RESULTS: The study group comprised 30 female and 30 male IVDs (mean age +- SD: 51.4 +- 19.5). Specimen's age, macroscopic and microscopic degeneration correlated negatively with the number of MCCs (r = -0.33-(-0.95); p < 0.0001), apart from the MCCs > 300 mum in diameter (r = 0.66-0.79; p < 0.0001). The negative relationship was strongest for the MCCs 10-50 mum in diameter. CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong negative correlation between the number of endplate MCCs, and both macroscopic and microscopic cervical IVD and endplate degeneration. This could further support the thesis that endplate calcification, through the occlusion of MCCs, leads to a fall in nutrient transport to the IVD, and subsequently causes its degeneration.",

Previously we identified ATP-gamma-S as a most promising antioxidant and neuroprotectant. To further improve both potency and metabolic stability of ATP-gamma-S, we designed a related analogue, ATP-gamma-S-(alpha,beta-CH2). We found that ATP-gamma-S-(alpha,beta-CH2) effectively inhibited ROS formation in PC12 cells subjected to Fe(II)-oxidation, slightly better than ATP-gamma-S (IC50 0.18 and 0.20 muM, respectively). Moreover, ATP-gamma-S-(alpha,beta-CH2) rescued primary neurons from Abeta42 toxicity, 4-fold more potently than ATP-gamma-S, (IC50 0.2 and 0.8 muM, respectively). In addition, the metabolic stability of ATP-gamma-S-(alpha,beta-CH2) in PC12 cells during 4 h of incubation, was up to 20% greater than that of ATP-gamma-S and ATP. Previously, we found that ATP-gamma-S-(alpha,beta-CH2) resisted hydrolysis by ecto-nucleotidases such as, NPPs and TNAP, and was found to be ~7-fold more potent agonist than ATP at P2Y11 receptor. Therefore, we propose ATP-gamma-S-(alpha,beta-CH2) as a promising agent for rescue of neurons from insults typical of Alzheimer's disease.",

Metal ions prefer to occupy three coordination sites at two Ndelta of the imidazole rings and one carbonyl oxygen. Simulated IR spectra reveal that vibrational frequency of C-O stretch affords a sensitive probe for understanding the interaction of His13-His14 with metal ions. The relative strength of the interaction of His13-His14 with the representative metal ions follows the order of K(+) < Ca(2+) < Zn(2+) < Cu(2+) < Fe(3+) < Al(3+), which is closely correlated with the available experimental results, providing a vivid physical picture about how metal ions bind to amyloid beta-peptide. IR spectra of the [M (His13-His14)](n+) complexes could be measured by infrared photodissociation spectroscopic technique and thus afford useful information for the understanding of structure-function relationship and the design of suitable drugs.",

    "abstract": "Thal amyloid phase, which describes the pattern of progressive amyloid-beta plaque deposition in Alzheimer's disease, was incorporated into the latest National Institute of Ageing - Alzheimer's Association neuropathologic assessment guidelines. Amyloid biomarkers (positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid) were included in clinical diagnostic guidelines for Alzheimer's disease dementia published by the National Institute of Ageing - Alzheimer's Association and the International Work group. Our first goal was to evaluate the correspondence of Thal amyloid phase to Braak tangle stage and ante-mortem clinical characteristics in a large autopsy cohort. Second, we examined the relevance of Thal amyloid phase in a prospectively-followed autopsied cohort who underwent ante-mortem (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B imaging; using the large autopsy cohort to broaden our perspective of (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B results. The Mayo Clinic Jacksonville Brain Bank case series (n = 3618) was selected regardless of ante-mortem clinical diagnosis and neuropathologic co-morbidities, and all assigned Thal amyloid phase and Braak tangle stage using thioflavin-S fluorescent microscopy. (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B studies from Mayo Clinic Rochester were available for 35 participants scanned within 2 years of death. Cortical (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B values were calculated as a standard uptake value ratio normalized to cerebellum grey/white matter. In the high likelihood Alzheimer's disease brain bank cohort (n = 1375), cases with lower Thal amyloid phases were older at death, had a lower Braak tangle stage, and were less frequently APOE-epsilon4 positive. Regression modelling in these Alzheimer's disease cases, showed that Braak tangle stage, but not Thal amyloid phase predicted age at onset, disease duration, and final Mini-Mental State Examination score. In contrast, Thal amyloid phase, but not Braak tangle stage or cerebral amyloid angiopathy predicted (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B standard uptake value ratio. In the 35 cases with ante-mortem amyloid imaging, a transition between Thal amyloid phases 1 to 2 seemed to correspond to (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B standard uptake value ratio of 1.4, which when using our pipeline is the cut-off point for detection of clear amyloid-positivity regardless of clinical diagnosis. Alzheimer's disease cases who were older and were APOE-epsilon4 negative tended to have lower amyloid phases. Although Thal amyloid phase predicted clinical characteristics of Alzheimer's disease patients, the pre-mortem clinical status was driven by Braak tangle stage. Thal amyloid phase correlated best with (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B values, but not Braak tangle stage or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B cut-off point value of 1.4 was approximately equivalent to a Thal amyloid phase of 1-2.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effects of 4-17 month supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants (Smartfish drink; Smartfish AS, Oslo, Norway) in 12 patients with minor cognitive impairment (MCI) [minimental state examination (MMSE) >=19], 2 patients with pre-MCI (normal MMSE), and 7 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) (MMSE <19). We measured the phagocytosis of amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta) by flow cytometry and microscopy, the transcription of inflammatory genes by RT-PCR, the production of resolvin D1 (RvD1) by enzyme immunoassay, and the cognitive status by MMSE. In patients with MCI and pre-MCI, phagocytosis of Abeta by monocytes increased from 530 to 1306 mean fluorescence intensity units (P = 0.016). The increase in patients with AD was not significant (N.S.). The lipidic mediator RvD1, which stimulates Abeta phagocytosis in vitro, increased in macrophages in 80% of patients with MCI and pre-MCI (mean increase 9.95 pg/ml) (N.S.). Transcription of inflammatory genes' mRNAs was increased in a subgroup of patients with low transcription at baseline, whereas it was not significantly changed in patients with high transcription at baseline. The mean MMSE score of patients with MCI and pre-MCI was 25.9 at baseline and 25.7 after 4-17 months (N.S.). Our study is the first to show significant immune and biochemical effects of omega-3 fatty acids with antioxidants in patients with MCI. Cognitive benefits of omega-3 supplementation in patients with MCI should be tested in a clinical trial.",

    "abstract": "The main hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal death. The McGill-R-Thy1-APP rat is one of the few transgenic rat models of AD that displays progressive amyloid pathology. This study aimed to further characterise this rat model, focusing on the pathological changes in the hippocampal formation and the parahippocampal region. These structures, that are important for episodic memory and spatial navigation, are affected in the early stages of the disease. This study used unbiased stereology to investigate possible neuronal loss in the CA1, subiculum and entorhinal cortex of 18-month-old homozygous McGill-R-Thy1-APP rats, and also quantified the plaque load in all the areas of the hippocampal formation and parahippocampal region from 9 to 18 months old. A significant reduction of neurons at 18 months was only seen in the subiculum. The first plaque pathology was seen at 9 months in the subiculum. Although the quantified plaque load was variable between animals, the pattern of spatiotemporal progression was similar for all animals. The spread of plaque pathology mainly affected anatomically connected regions. Overall, the plaque pathology observed in the transgenic rats was similar to the early phases of amyloid beta (Abeta)-deposition described in human patients. The findings here thus indicate that the McGill-R-Thy1-APP rat could be a good model of the Abeta pathology in AD, but less so with respect to neuron loss.",

    "abstract": "Anesthetics have been reported to promote Alzheimer's disease neuropathogenesis by inducing amyloid beta (Abeta) protein accumulation and apoptosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of propofol on the apoptosis, Abeta accumulation, and inflammation induced by sevoflurane in human neuroglioma cells. Human neuroglioma cells were treated with or without sevoflurane and then co-incubated with or without propofol. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (FACS) using AV-PI kits, and data showed that apoptosis induced by sevoflurane was significantly attenuated by propofol treatment. In addition, with the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production measured by FACS after staining with dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate, propofol could significantly reduce the production of ROS as well as the accumulation of Abeta induced by sevoflurane assessed by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) analysis. On the other hand, the same treatment decreased the inflammation factor production of interleukin-6. Moreover, the level of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) was tested by Western blot and immunofluorescence assay. We found that the activation of NF-kappaB pathway was suppressed by propofol. The results suggest that propofol can effectively attenuate the apoptosis, Abeta accumulation, and inflammation induced by sevoflurane in human neuroglioma cells through NF-kappaB signal pathway.",

    "abstract": "Our previous study suggests that ginger root extract can reverse behavioral dysfunction and prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like symptoms induced by the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) in a rat model. 6-Gingerol is the major gingerol in ginger rhizomes, but its effect on the treatment of AD remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine if 6-gingerol had a protective effect on Abeta1-42-induced damage and apoptotic death in rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12 cells) and to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which 6-gingerol may exert its neuroprotective effects. Our results indicated that pre-treatment with 6-gingerol significantly increased cell viability and reduced cell apoptosis in Abeta1-42-treated cells. Moreover, 6-gingerol pretreatment markedly reduced the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), the production of nitric oxide (NO), and the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity compared with the Abeta1-42 treatment group. In addition, 6-gingerol pretreatment also significantly enhanced the protein levels of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (p-GSK-3beta). Overall, these results indicate that 6-gingerol exhibited protective effects on apoptosis induced by Abeta1-42 in cultured PC12 cells by reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, suppressing the activation of GSK-3beta and enhancing the activation of Akt, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects. Therefore, 6-gingerol may be useful in the prevention and/or treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding, RNA molecules approximately 22 nucleotides in length which act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Individual miRNAs have been shown to regulate the expression of multiple genes. Conversely, the expression of individual genes can be regulated by multiple miRNAs. Consequently, since their discovery just over 20 years ago, miRNAs have been identified as key regulators of complex biological processes linked to multiple cardiovascular pathologies, including left ventricular hypertrophy, ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension and arrhythmias. Furthermore, since the finding that miRNAs are present in the circulation, they have been investigated as novel biomarkers, especially in the context of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and heart failure. While there is little convincing evidence that miRNAs can outperform traditional biomarkers, such as cardiac troponins, in the diagnosis of AMI, there is potential for miRNAs to complement existing risk prediction models and act as valuable markers of post-AMI prognosis. Encouragingly, the concept of miRNA-based therapeutics is developing, with synthetic antagonists of miRNAs (antagomiRs) currently in phase II trials for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. In the cardiovascular field, promising preclinical studies suggest that they could be useful in treating disorders ranging from heart failure to dyslipidaemia, although several challenges related to specificity and targeted delivery remain to be overcome. Through this review, we provide clinicians with a brief overview of the ever-expanding world of miRNAs.",

    "title": "Bioenergetic mechanisms in astrocytes may contribute to amyloid plaque deposition and toxicity.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized neuropathologically by synaptic disruption, neuronal loss, and deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) protein in brain structures that are critical for memory and cognition. There is increasing appreciation, however, that astrocytes, which are the major non-neuronal glial cells, may play an important role in AD pathogenesis. Unlike neurons, astrocytes are resistant to Abeta cytotoxicity, which may, in part, be related to their greater reliance on glycolytic metabolism. Here we show that, in cultures of human fetal astrocytes, pharmacological inhibition or molecular down-regulation of a main enzymatic regulator of glycolysis, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase (PFKFB3), results in increased accumulation of Abeta within and around astrocytes and greater vulnerability of these cells to Abeta toxicity. We further investigated age-dependent changes in PFKFB3 and astrocytes in AD transgenic mice (TgCRND8) that overexpress human Abeta. Using a combination of Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, we identified an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in astrocytes that paralleled the escalation of the Abeta plaque burden in TgCRND8 mice in an age-dependent manner. Furthermore, PFKFB3 expression also demonstrated an increase in these mice, although at a later age (9 months) than GFAP and Abeta. Immunohistochemical staining showed significant reactive astrogliosis surrounding Abeta plaques with increased PFKFB3 activity in 12-month-old TgCRND8 mice, an age when AD pathology and behavioral deficits are fully manifested. These studies shed light on the unique bioenergetic mechanisms within astrocytes that may contribute to the development of AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "Self-assembly of Abeta peptides into amyloid aggregates has been suggested as the major cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nowadays, there is no medication for AD, but experimental data indicate that reversion of the process of amyloid aggregation reduces the symptoms of disease. In this paper, all 8000 tripeptides were studied for their ability to destroy Abeta fibrils. The docking method and the more sophisticated MM-PBSA (molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area) method were employed to calculate the binding affinity and mode of tripeptides to Abeta fibrils. The ability of these peptides to depolymerize Abeta fibrils was also investigated experimentally using atomic force microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy (Thioflavin T assay). It was shown that tripeptides prefer to bind to hydrophobic regions of 6Abeta9-40 fibrils. Tripeptides WWW, WWP, WPW and PWW were found to be the most potent binders. In vitro experiments showed that tight-binding tripeptides have significant depolymerizing activities and their DC50 values determined from dose-response curves were in micromolar range. The ability of nonbinding (GAM, AAM) and weak-binding (IVL and VLA) tripeptides to destroy Abeta fibrils was negligible. In vitro data of tripeptide depolymerizing activities support the predictions obtained by molecular docking and all-atom simulation methods. Our results suggest that presence of multiple complexes of heterocycles forming by tryptophan and proline residues in tripeptides is crucial for their tight binding to Abeta fibrils as well as for extensive fibril depolymerization. We recommend PWW for further studies as it has the lowest experimental binding constant.",

    "abstract": "Physical exercise may provide protection against the cognitive decline and neuropathology associated with Alzheimer's disease, although the mechanisms are not clear. In the present study, APP/PSEN1 double-transgenic and wild-type mice were allowed unlimited voluntary exercise for 7months. Consistent with previous reports, wheel-running improved cognition in the double-transgenic mice. Interestingly, the average daily distance run was strongly correlated with spatial memory in the water maze in wild-type mice (r(2)=.959), but uncorrelated in transgenics (r(2)=.013). Proteomics analysis showed that sedentary transgenic mice differed significantly from sedentary wild-types with respect to proteins involved in synaptic transmission, cytoskeletal regulation, and neurogenesis. When given an opportunity to exercise, the transgenics' deficiencies in cytoskeletal regulation and neurogenesis largely normalized, but abnormal synaptic proteins did not change. In contrast, exercise enhanced proteins associated with cytoskeletal regulation, oxidative phosphorylation, and synaptic transmission in wild-type mice. Soluble and insoluble Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels were significantly decreased in both cortex and hippocampus of active transgenics, suggesting that this may have played a role in the cognitive improvement in APP/PSEN1 mice. beta-secretase was significantly reduced in active APP/PSEN1 mice compared to sedentary controls, suggesting a mechanism for reduced Abeta. Taken together, these data illustrate that exercise improves memory in wild-type and APP-overexpressing mice in fundamentally different ways.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Increased pulse pressure associated with age-related arterial stiffening increases risk for Alzheimer dementia but the mechanism responsible for this association remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between pulse pressure and cerebral spinal fluid biomarker profiles of preclinical Alzheimer disease, investigate whether observed relationships are stronger in adults with more advanced arterial age (>=80 years of age), and examine the relationship between pulse pressure and progression to dementia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this retrospective cohort study, 877 participants without dementia (55-91 years of age) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative underwent baseline health assessment, including blood pressure assessment and lumbar puncture for determination of cerebral spinal fluid phosphorylated tau (P-tau) and beta-amyloid 1-42. Participants have been followed up longitudinally since 2005. The last date of examination was October 15, 2013. Clinical follow-up between 6 and 96 months tracked progression to dementia. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Regression and analysis of covariance analyses investigated relationships between pulse pressure and distinct cerebral spinal fluid biomarker profiles. Very old participants (80 years or older) were compared with younger participants (55-79 years of age) on clinical measures and pulse pressure x age group interactions were investigated. Survival analysis examined the effect of baseline pulse pressure on progression to dementia. Covariates were age, sex, apolipoprotein E genotype, body mass index, vascular risk factors, and antihypertensive medication use. RESULTS: Individuals with a P-tau-positive biomarker profile exhibited mean (SD) elevated pulse pressure regardless of age (62.0 [15.6] mm Hg for a P-tau-positive biomarker vs 57.4 [14.0] mm Hg for P-tau-negative biomarker; P = .04). In very old participants, a further increase in pulse pressure was observed in those exhibiting both P-tau elevation and beta-amyloid 1-42 reduction vs either biomarkers alone (69.7 [16.0] mm Hg for both positive biomarkers vs 63.18 [13.0] mm Hg for P-tau alone vs 60.1 [16.4] mm Hg for beta-amyloid 1-42 alone vs 56.6 [14.5] mm Hg for negative biomarkers; P = .003). Those with higher baseline pulse pressure progressed to dementia more rapidly (95% CI, 1.000-1.048; P = .05; hazard ratio = 1.024). Systolic pressure exhibited similar relationships with Alzheimer disease biomarkers and progression to dementia in the very old subgroup (P < .05) but showed no associations in the young old subgroup (P > .10). Diastolic pressure was reduced in young old participants with isolated phosphorylated tau elevation (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Pulse pressure, an index of vascular aging, was associated with neurodegenerative change prior to the onset of dementia across a broad age range. Among those with more advanced age, higher pulse pressure was also associated with cerebral amyloidosis in the presence of neurodegeneration and more rapid progression to dementia. Diastolic contributions to these biomarker associations were limited to young old participants whereas systolic contributions were found only in very old participants.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomographic (PET) amyloid biomarkers have been proposed for the detection of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology in living patients and for the tracking of longitudinal changes, but the relation between biomarkers needs further study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between CSF and PET amyloid biomarkers (cross-sectional and longitudinal measures) and compare the cutoffs for these measures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal clinical cohort study from 2005 to 2014 including 820 participants with at least 1 florbetapir F-18 (hereafter referred to as simply florbetapir)-PET scan and at least 1 CSF beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42) sample obtained within 30 days of each other (501 participants had a second PET scan after 2 years, including 150 participants with CSF Abeta1-42 measurements). Data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Four different PET scans processing pipelines from 2 different laboratories were compared. The PET cutoff values were established using a mixture-modeling approach, and different mathematical models were applied to define the association between CSF and PET amyloid measures. RESULTS: The values of the CSF Abeta1-42 samples and florbetapir-PET scans showed a nonlinear association (R2 = 0.48-0.66), with the strongest association for values in the middle range. The presence of a larger dynamic range of florbetapir-PET scan values in the higher range compared with the CSF Abeta1-42 plateau explained the differences in correlation with cognition (R2 = 0.36 and R2 = 0.25, respectively). The APOE genotype significantly modified the association between both biomarkers. The PET cutoff values derived from an unsupervised classifier converged with previous PET cutoff values and the established CSF Abeta1-42 cutoff levels. There was no association between longitudinal Abeta1-42 levels and standardized uptake value ratios during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The association between both biomarkers is limited to a middle range of values, is modified by the APOE genotype, and is absent for longitudinal changes; 4 different approaches in 2 different platforms converge on similar pathological Abeta cutoff levels; and different pipelines to process PET scans showed correlated but not identical results. Our findings suggest that both biomarkers measure different aspects of AD Abeta pathology.",

METHODS: Open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter, phase 3 study to validate the (18)F-labeled beta-amyloid tracer florbetaben by comparing in vivo PET imaging with post-mortem histopathology. RESULTS: Brain images and tissue from 74 deceased subjects (of 216 trial participants) were analyzed. Forty-six of 47 neuritic beta-amyloid-positive cases were read as PET positive, and 24 of 27 neuritic beta-amyloid plaque-negative cases were read as PET negative (sensitivity 97.9% [95% confidence interval or CI 93.8-100%], specificity 88.9% [95% CI 77.0-100%]). In a subgroup, a regional tissue-scan matched analysis was performed. In areas known to strongly accumulate beta-amyloid plaques, sensitivity and specificity were 82% to 90%, and 86% to 95%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Florbetaben PET shows high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of histopathology-confirmed neuritic beta-amyloid plaques and may thus be a valuable adjunct to clinical diagnosis, particularly for the exclusion of AD.

    "title": "Zinc as chaperone-mimicking agent for retardation of amyloid beta peptide fibril formation.",
    "abstract": "Metal ions have emerged to play a key role in the aggregation process of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide that is closely related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. A detailed understanding of the underlying mechanistic process of peptide-metal interactions, however, has been challenging to obtain. By applying a combination of NMR relaxation dispersion and fluorescence kinetics methods we have investigated quantitatively the thermodynamic Abeta-Zn(2+) binding features as well as how Zn(2+) modulates the nucleation mechanism of the aggregation process. Our results show that, under near-physiological conditions, substoichiometric amounts of Zn(2+) effectively retard the generation of amyloid fibrils. A global kinetic profile analysis reveals that in the absence of zinc Abeta40 aggregation is driven by a monomer-dependent secondary nucleation process in addition to fibril-end elongation. In the presence of Zn(2+), the elongation rate is reduced, resulting in reduction of the aggregation rate, but not a complete inhibition of amyloid formation. We show that Zn(2+) transiently binds to residues in the N terminus of the monomeric peptide. A thermodynamic analysis supports a model where the N terminus is folded around the Zn(2+) ion, forming a marginally stable, short-lived folded Abeta40 species. This conformation is highly dynamic and only a few percent of the peptide molecules adopt this structure at any given time point. Our findings suggest that the folded Abeta40-Zn(2+) complex modulates the fibril ends, where elongation takes place, which efficiently retards fibril formation. In this conceptual framework we propose that zinc adopts the role of a minimal antiaggregation chaperone for Abeta40.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of amyloid beta(1-42) peptide (Abeta(1-42)) in retina is implicated in the development of retinal ganglion cell apoptosis and diabetic retinopathy. In this study we demonstrate that spontaneous diabetes mellitus Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats can be used as an animal model in studies to identify the expression of Abeta in diabetic retinas. In addition, we investigated the relation between glucose level and Abeta production in the retinas of OLETF rats. In the retinas of Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats used as normal controls and OLETF rats, no expression of neprilysin (NEP), which degrades Abeta, was detected, and the expression levels of genes associated with Abeta production (amyloid precursor protein, beta site APP cleaving enzyme, and presenilin) and Abeta(1-42) levels in the retinas of 60-week-old OLETF rats with diabetes mellitus were significantly higher than in 60-week-old LETO rat retinas. Furthermore, the increase in the expression levels of genes associated with Abeta production was enhanced by administration of glucose (3.0 g/kg; OGT test), and close relations between the retinal Abeta(1-42) level and plasma blood glucose and HbA1c were observed. In conclusion, we have found that Abeta accumulates easily in the retinas of LETO and OLETF rats due to the absence of NEP. In addition, we determined that the accumulation of Abeta(1-42) in the retinas of OLETF rats is promoted by high plasma glucose levels. Therefore OLETF rats may be a suitable model for studies to identify the expression of Abeta in diabetic retinas.",

    "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons have been proposed to be a highly valuable cellular model for studying the pathomechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies employing patient-specific human iPSCs as models of familial and sporadic forms of AD described elevated levels of AD-related amyloid-beta (Abeta). However, none of the present AD iPSC studies could recapitulate the synaptotoxic actions of Abeta, which are crucial early events in a cascade that eventually leads to vast brain degeneration. Here we established highly reproducible, human iPSC-derived cortical cultures as a cellular model to study the synaptotoxic effects of Abeta. We developed a highly efficient immunopurification procedure yielding immature neurons that express markers of deep layer cortical pyramidal neurons and GABAergic interneurons. Upon long-term cultivation, purified cells differentiated into mature neurons exhibiting the generation of action potentials and excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic synapses. Most interestingly, these iPSC-derived human neurons were strongly susceptible to the synaptotoxic actions of Abeta. Application of Abeta for 8 days led to a reduction in the overall FM4-64 and vGlut1 staining of vesicles in neurites, indicating a loss of vesicle clusters. A selective analysis of presynaptic vesicle clusters on dendrites did not reveal a significant change, thus suggesting that Abeta impaired axonal vesicle clusters. In addition, electrophysiological patch-clamp recordings of AMPA receptor-mediated miniature EPSCs revealed an Abeta-induced reduction in amplitudes, indicating an impairment of postsynaptic AMPA receptors. A loss of postsynaptic AMPA receptor clusters was confirmed by immunocytochemical stainings for GluA1. Incubation with Abeta for 8 days did not result in a significant loss of neurites or cell death. In summary, we describe a highly reproducible cellular AD model based on human iPSC-derived cortical neurons that enables the mechanistic analysis of Abeta-induced synaptic pathomechanisms and the development of novel therapeutic approaches.",

Biomarkers to monitor Abeta metabolism and aggregation directly in patients are important for further detailed study of the involvement of Abeta in disease pathogenesis and to monitor the biochemical effect of drugs targeting Abeta in clinical trials. Furthermore, if anti-Abeta disease-modifying drugs prove to be effective clinically, amyloid biomarkers will be of special value in the clinic to identify patients with brain amyloid deposition at risk for progression to AD dementia, to enable initiation of treatment before neurodegeneration is too severe, and to monitor drug effects on Abeta metabolism or pathology to guide dosage. Two types of amyloid biomarker have been developed: Abeta-binding ligands for use in positron emission tomography (PET) and assays to measure Abeta42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In this review, we present the rationales behind these biomarkers and compare their ability to measure Abeta plaque load in the brain.

    "abstract": "Urban adolescents face economic, social, and behavioral challenges in adhering to long-term contraceptive use. Use of text messaging reminders has the potential to increase adherence to family planning appointments and to educate patients about safe sexual health practices; however, nonresponsiveness to messages is difficult to interpret and may jeopardize programmatic success. We aimed to understand why adolescent girls enrolled in a randomized, controlled pilot trial (DepoText) designed to increase attendance at family planning visits were periodically nonresponsive to text messages through conducting structured interviews with participants whose text reply rates were less than 100 % during the trial period. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected and classified using descriptive data analysis. Reasons for nonresponsiveness, barriers to continuous cell phone coverage, cell phone plan characteristics, and attitudes toward the DepoText program were the primary endpoints of interest. Most participants (78%) attributed instances of nonresponsiveness to being away from the phone or due to a personal conflict such as school or work. Service interruption due to bill nonpayment (44%), phone loss (28%), and cell phone number change (28%) were significant barriers to continuous coverage during the trial period, and many respondents indicated that the downturn in the economy made it more difficult to maintain their cell phone plan. Almost a third reported having to choose between cell phone and other payments, but the vast majority (88%) considered their cell phone a \"need\" rather than a \"want.\" Participants universally expressed satisfaction with the text messaging program and reported feeling more connected to the clinic (96%) through the messages serving as reminders (64%), encouragement to assume personal responsibility for their health care (12%), and enhanced personal connection with the clinic staff (4%). Our study suggests that a text messaging program can be used in an urban clinical setting to communicate with adolescent girls about family planning services. While economic barriers to continuous cell phone coverage do exist, adolescents indicate that the text message reminder system can be a valuable tool for enhancing clinic connectedness and promoting autonomy in care-seeking behavior.",

METHODS: We analyzed aqueous extracts from multiple AD brains using an array of techniques. RESULTS: Brains can contain at least four different Abeta assembly forms including: (i) monomers, (ii) a ~7 kDa Abeta species, and larger species (iii) from ~30-150 kDa, and (iv) >160 kDa. High molecular weight species are by far the most prevalent and appear to be built from ~7 kDa Abeta species. The ~7 kDa Abeta species resist denaturation by chaotropic agents and have a higher Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio than monomers, and are unreactive with antibodies to Asp1 of Ab or APP residues N-terminal of Asp1. DISCUSSION: Further analysis of brain-derived ~7 kDa Abeta species, the mechanism by which they assemble and the structures they form should reveal therapeutic and diagnostic opportunities.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic cigarette smoking is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The goal of this study was to determine if smoking history moderated the associations of age and APOE genotype (the most robust risk factors for AD) on brain amyloid deposition, glucose metabolism, and neurocognition in cognitively-normal elders. METHODS: Participants (n = 264) were grouped according to their APOE epsilon4 carrier status (epsilon4 carrier: APOE4+; non-epsilon4 carrier: APOE4-) and smoking status (smokers: at least 1 year of smoking during lifetime; never-smokers: no history of smoking). Approximately 89% of the smoking sample was former-smokers. We specifically tested for interactions of smoking status with APOE epsilon4 carrier status and age on measures of cortical amyloid deposition, glucose metabolism, and neurocognition. RESULTS: (1) smoking status interacted with APOE epsilon4 carrier status, where smoker APOE4+ showed lower glucose metabolism and poorer auditory-verbal learning and memory than never-smoking APOE4-, never-smoking APOE4+, and smoking APOE4-; (2) smoking status interacted with age on measures of semantic fluency, processing speed/set-shifting and global neurocognition; smokers, irrespective of APOE epsilon4 carrier status, demonstrated poorer performance with increasing age than never-smokers; and (3) smoking APOE4+ and never-smoking APOE4+ showed greater cortical amyloid deposition than never-smoking APOE4- and smoking APOE4-. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate consideration of smoking history is essential to both better understand the factors associated with neurobiological and neurocognitive abnormalities in elders, and the risk for development of AD-related neuropathology.",

    "abstract": "Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is an acquired primary tauopathy with a variety of cognitive, behavioral, and motor symptoms linked to cumulative brain damage sustained from single, episodic, or repetitive traumatic brain injury (TBI). No definitive clinical diagnosis for this condition exists. In this work, we used [F-18]FDDNP PET to detect brain patterns of neuropathology distribution in retired professional American football players with suspected CTE (n = 14) and compared results with those of cognitively intact controls (n = 28) and patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD) (n = 24), a disease that has been cognitively associated with CTE. [F-18]FDDNP PET imaging results in the retired players suggested the presence of neuropathological patterns consistent with models of concussion wherein brainstem white matter tracts undergo early axonal damage and cumulative axonal injuries along subcortical, limbic, and cortical brain circuitries supporting mood, emotions, and behavior. This deposition pattern is distinctively different from the progressive pattern of neuropathology [paired helical filament (PHF)-tau and amyloid-beta] in AD, which typically begins in the medial temporal lobe progressing along the cortical default mode network, with no or minimal involvement of subcortical structures. This particular [F-18]FDDNP PET imaging pattern in cases of suspected CTE also is primarily consistent with PHF-tau distribution observed at autopsy in subjects with a history of mild TBI and autopsy-confirmed diagnosis of CTE.",

    "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the neurotrophin family, which plays important roles in learning and memory formation and in protecting neurons from diverse neurotoxic insults, such as amyloid-beta (Abeta). Since BDNF expression is decreased in patients with Alzheimer's disease, various strategies have attempted to increase BDNF levels. In a previous study, we screened and identified a novel BDNF-modulating peptide (consisting of methionine-valine-glycine, named Neuropep-1) by a positional scanning-synthetic peptide combinatorial library (PS-SPCL). Neuropep-1 exhibited neuroprotective effects against in vitro and in vivo Alzheimer's disease models. Based on the previous PS-SPCL data, we modified the amino acid sequence of Neuropep-1 in this study to identify a more potent novel BDNF-modulating peptide. By replacing the valine in the second position with aspartic acid, the resulting Neuropep-4 was found to be highly effective in inducing BDNF expression even at concentrations of 1pM in the SH-SY5Y cell line and rat primary cortical neurons. In addition, among the tested peptides, Neuropep-4 provided neurons with the strongest protection against oligomeric and/or fibrillar Abeta1-42-induced cell death through BDNF upregulation. These results suggest the potential of Neuropep-4 as a therapeutic candidate for treating neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD.",

    "title": "Gleason 6 Prostate Cancer: Translating Biology into Population Health.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Gleason 6 (3+3) is the most commonly diagnosed prostate cancer among men with prostate specific antigen screening, the most histologically well differentiated and is associated with the most favorable prognosis. Despite its prevalence, considerable debate exists regarding the genetic features, clinical significance, natural history, metastatic potential and optimal management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Members of the Young Urologic Oncologists in the Society of Urologic Oncology cooperated in a comprehensive search of the peer reviewed English medical literature on Gleason 6 prostate cancer, specifically focusing on the history of the Gleason scoring system, histological features, clinical characteristics, practice patterns and outcomes. RESULTS: The Gleason scoring system was devised in the early 1960s, widely adopted by 1987 and revised in 2005 with a more restrictive definition of Gleason 6 disease. There is near consensus that Gleason 6 meets pathological definitions of cancer, but controversy about whether it meets commonly accepted molecular and genetic criteria of cancer. Multiple clinical series suggest that the metastatic potential of contemporary Gleason 6 disease is negligible but not zero. Population based studies in the U.S. suggest that more than 90% of men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer undergo treatment and are exposed to the risk of morbidity for a cancer unlikely to cause symptoms or decrease life expectancy. Efforts have been proposed to minimize the number of men diagnosed with or treated for Gleason 6 prostate cancer. These include modifications to prostate specific antigen based screening strategies such as targeting high risk populations, decreasing the frequency of screening, recommending screening cessation, incorporating remaining life expectancy estimates, using shared decision making and novel biomarkers, and eliminating prostate specific antigen screening entirely. Large nonrandomized and randomized studies have shown that active surveillance is an effective management strategy for men with Gleason 6 disease. Active surveillance dramatically reduces the number of men undergoing treatment without apparent compromise of cancer related outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The definition and clinical relevance of Gleason 6 prostate cancer have changed substantially since its introduction nearly 50 years ago. A high proportion of screen detected cancers are Gleason 6 and the metastatic potential is negligible. Dramatically reducing the diagnosis and treatment of Gleason 6 disease is likely to have a favorable impact on the net benefit of prostate cancer screening.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting more than 35 million people worldwide. Brain hypometabolism is a major feature of AD, appearing decades before cognitive decline and pathologic lesions. To date, the majority of studies on hypometabolism in AD have used transgenic animal models or imaging studies of the human brain. As it is almost impossible to validate these findings using human tissue, alternative models are required. In this study, we show that human stem cell-derived neuron and astrocyte cultures treated with oligomers of amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42) also display a clear hypometabolism, particularly with regard to utilization of substrates such as glucose, pyruvate, lactate, and glutamate. In addition, a significant increase in the glycogen content of cells was also observed. These changes were accompanied by changes in NAD(+)/NADH, ATP, and glutathione levels, suggesting a disruption in the energy-redox axis within these cultures. The high energy demands associated with neuronal functions such as memory formation and protection from oxidative stress put these cells at particular risk from Abeta-induced hypometabolism. Further research using this model may elucidate the mechanisms associated with Abeta-induced hypometabolism.",

    "title": "Divalent Copper as a Major Triggering Agent in Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is at epidemic proportions in developed countries, with a steady increase in the early 1900 s, and then exploding over the last 50 years. This epidemiology points to something causative in the environment of developed countries. This paper will review the considerable evidence that that something could be inorganic copper ingestion. The epidemic parallels closely the spread of copper plumbing, with copper leached from the plumbing into drinking water being a main causal feature, aided by the increasingly common use of supplement pills containing copper. Inorganic copper is divalent copper, or copper-2, while we now know that organic copper, or copper in foods, is primarily monovalent copper, or copper-1. The intestinal transport system, Ctr1, absorbs copper-1 and the copper moves to the liver, where it is put into safe channels. Copper-2 is not absorbed by Ctr1, and some of it bypasses the liver and goes directly into the blood, where it appears to be exquisitely toxic to brain cognition. Thus, while aggregation of amyloid-beta has been postulated to be the cause of AD under current dogma, the great increase in prevalence over the last century appears to be due to ingestion of copper-2, which may be causing the aggregation, and/or increasing the oxidant toxicity of the aggregates. An alternative hypothesis proposes that oxidant stress is the primary injuring agent, and under this hypothesis, copper-2 accumulation in the brain may be a causal factor of the oxidant injury. Thus, irrespective of which hypothesis is correct, AD can be classified, at least in part, as a copper-2 toxicity disease. It is relatively easy to avoid copper-2 ingestion, as discussed in this review. If most people begin avoiding copper-2 ingestion, perhaps the epidemic of this serious disease can be aborted.",

    "abstract": "The senescence-accelerated mouse (SAMP8) strain exhibits an age-related decrease in memory accompanied by an increase in hippocampal amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) and amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). We have shown that administration of an antisense oligonucleotide against the Abeta region of AbetaPP (AbetaPP antisense) reverses the memory deficits. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of peripheral (IV) administration of AbetaPP antisense on hippocampal gene expression. The AbetaPP antisense reversed the memory deficits and altered expression of 944 hippocampal genes. Pathway analysis showed significant gene expression changes in nine pathways. These include the MAPK signaling pathway (p = 0.0078) and the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway (p = 0.043), which we have previously shown to be altered in SAMP8 mice. The changes in these pathways contributed to significant changes in the neurotropin (p = 0.0083) and insulin signaling (p = 0.015) pathways, which are known to be important in learning and memory. Changes in these pathways were accompanied by phosphorylation changes in the downstream target proteins p70S6K, GSK3beta, ERK, and CREB. These changes in hippocampal gene expression and protein phosphorylation may suggest specific new targets for antisense therapy aimed at improving memory.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing socioeconomic problem worldwide. Early diagnosis and prevention of this devastating disease have become a research priority. Consequently, the identification of clinically significant and sensitive blood biomarkers for its early detection is very important. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a well-known and established genetic risk factor for late-onset AD; however, the impact of the protein level on AD risk is unclear. We assessed the utility of plasma ApoE protein as a potential biomarker of AD in the large, well-characterised Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing (AIBL) cohort. METHODS: Total plasma ApoE levels were measured at 18-month follow-up using a commercial bead-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: the Luminex xMAP human apolipoprotein kit. ApoE levels were then analysed between clinical classifications (healthy controls, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD) and correlated with the data available from the AIBL cohort, including but not limited to APOE genotype and cerebral amyloid burden. RESULTS: A significant decrease in ApoE levels was found in the AD group compared with the healthy controls. These results validate previously published ApoE protein levels at baseline obtained using different methodology. ApoE protein levels were also significantly affected, depending on APOE genotypes, with epsilon2/epsilon2 having the highest protein levels and epsilon4/epsilon4 having the lowest. Plasma ApoE levels were significantly negatively correlated with cerebral amyloid burden as measured by neuroimaging. CONCLUSIONS: ApoE is decreased in individuals with AD compared with healthy controls at 18-month follow-up, and this trend is consistent with our results published at baseline. The influence of APOE genotype and sex on the protein levels are also explored. It is clear that ApoE is a strong player in the aetiology of this disease at both the protein and genetic levels.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of redox-active metal ions, in particular copper, in amyloid plaques is considered to the cause of the intensive oxidation damage to the brain of patients with Alzheimers disease (AD). Drug candidates based on a bis(8-aminoquinoline) tetradentate ligand are able to efficiently extract Cu(2+) from copper-loaded amyloids (Cu-Abeta). Contrarily, in the presence of a bidentate hydroxyquinoline, such as clioquinol, the copper is not released from Abeta, but remains sequestrated within a Abeta-Cu-clioquinol ternary complex that has been characterized by mass spectrometry. Facile extraction of copper(II) at a low amyloid/ligand ratio is essential for the re-introduction of copper in regular metal circulation in the brain. As, upon reduction, the Cu(+) is easily released from the bis(8-aminoquinoline) ligand unable to accommodate Cu(I), it should be taken by proteins with an affinity for copper. So, the tetradentate bis(8-aminoquinoline) described here might act as a regulator of copper homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "It was demonstrated that treatment with beta amyloid (Abeta) led to extreme alterations in the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Also, malfunction of the cholinergic system is correlated to the memory and cognitive impairments. Several new studies have suggested that Berberis vulgaris can act as a cholinesterase inhibitor. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of berberine (BER) on the Abeta-induced impairments in learning and memory. The male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups of Sham, BER, Abeta and Abeta+BER. The administration of BER or its vehicle started immediately after the injection of Abeta and followed by 13 days. Then, the animals were tested for learning and memory performance using the Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance tests. Then, they were sacrificed for the whole cell patch clamp recording. The results of the MWM and passive avoidance tasks indicated that administration of the BER in the Abeta+BER group prevented the memory impairment induced by Abeta. The results of the whole cell patch clamp also showed that administration of the BER restored the Abeta-induced impairments in the firing frequency, half-width and rebound action potential. These results suggested that administration of the BER could ameliorate neurotoxicity induced by Abeta. However, this neuroprotection impact could be resulted from the balance effect of the Ca(2+) entry. The optimal level of Ca(2+) entry by BER could be a major factor that modified the function of the Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels and decreased the half-width in the Abeta treated rats.",

    "abstract": "The involvement of Amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well established. However, it is becoming clear that the amyloid load in AD brains consists of a heterogeneous mixture of Abeta peptides, implying that a thorough understanding of their respective role and toxicity is crucial for the development of efficient treatments. Besides the well-studied Abeta40 and Abeta42 species, recent data have raised the possibility that Abeta43 peptides might be instrumental in AD pathogenesis, because they are frequently observed in both dense and diffuse amyloid plaques from human AD brains and are highly amyloidogenic in vitro. However, whether Abeta43 is toxic in vivo is currently unclear. Using Drosophila transgenic models of amyloid pathology, we show that Abeta43 peptides are mainly insoluble and highly toxic in vivo, leading to the progressive loss of photoreceptor neurons, altered locomotion and decreased lifespan when expressed in the adult fly nervous system. In addition, we demonstrate that Abeta43 species are able to trigger the aggregation of the typically soluble and non-toxic Abeta40, leading to synergistic toxic effects on fly lifespan and climbing ability, further suggesting that Abeta43 peptides could act as a nucleating factor in AD brains. Altogether, our study demonstrates high pathogenicity of Abeta43 species in vivo and supports the idea that Abeta43 contributes to the pathological events leading to neurodegeneration in AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to be caused by accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta), which is a cleavage product of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Transgenic mice overexpressing APP have been used to recapitulate amyloid-beta pathology. Among them, APP23 and APPswe/PS1deltaE9 (deltaE9) mice are extensively studied. APP23 mice express APP with Swedish mutation and develop amyloid plaques late in their life, while cognitive deficits are observed in young age. In contrast, deltaE9 mice with mutant APP and mutant presenilin-1 develop amyloid plaques early but show typical cognitive deficits in old age. To unveil the reasons for different progressions of cognitive decline in these commonly used mouse models, we analyzed the number and turnover of dendritic spines as important structural correlates for learning and memory. Chronic in vivo two-photon imaging in apical tufts of layer V pyramidal neurons revealed a decreased spine density in 4-5-month-old APP23 mice. In age-matched deltaE9 mice, in contrast, spine loss was only observed on cortical dendrites that were in close proximity to amyloid plaques. In both cases, the reduced spine density was caused by decreased spine formation. Interestingly, the patterns of alterations in spine morphology differed between these two transgenic mouse models. Moreover, in APP23 mice, APP was found to accumulate intracellularly and its content was inversely correlated with the absolute spine density and the relative number of mushroom spines. Collectively, our results suggest that different pathological mechanisms, namely an intracellular accumulation of APP or extracellular amyloid plaques, may lead to spine abnormalities in young adult APP23 and deltaE9 mice, respectively. These distinct features, which may represent very different mechanisms of synaptic failure in AD, have to be taken into consideration when translating results from animal studies to the human disease.",

First, calcium ions change the tertiary structure of the bound Abeta monomer by destabilizing several long-range intrapeptide interactions, particularly the salt bridge Asp(23)-Lys(28). Second, calcium strengthens Abeta peptide binding to the DMPC bilayer by enhancing electrostatic interactions between charged amino acids and lipid polar headgroups. As a result, Abeta monomer penetrates deeper into the bilayer, making disorder in proximal lipids and bilayer thinning more pronounced. Third, because calcium ions demonstrate strong affinity to negatively charged amino acids, a considerable influx of calcium into the area proximal to the bound Abeta monomer is observed. Consequently, the localizations of negatively charged amino acids and calcium ions in the Abeta binding footprint overlap. Based on our data, we propose a mechanism by which calcium ions strengthen Abeta-bilayer interactions. This mechanism involves two factors: 1) calcium ions make the DMPC bilayer partially cationic and thus attractive to the anionic Abeta peptide; and 2) destabilization of the Asp(23)-Lys(28) salt bridge makes Lys(28) available for interactions with the bilayer. Finally, we conclude that a single Abeta monomer does not promote permeation of calcium ions through the zwitterionic bilayer.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) is a peptide derived from processing of the membrane bound amyloid precursor protein and is a main constituent in amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The excess Abeta in AD brain may be caused by altered Abeta metabolism, including reduced enzymatic degradation. Our previous enzymatic study of Abeta degradation revealed that intracellular enzymes produced several truncated Abeta mid-domain fragments. We therefore generated an antibody to enable identification of these anticipated Abeta species in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The produced antibody displayed affinity for the Abeta mid-domain region and 36 N-terminally truncated Abeta fragments were precipitated from human CSF and identified by liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry. 31 peptides were truncated from residue 18 up to 23, N-terminal truncation that have not previously been identified in CSF. The results show that the complexity of amyloid beta peptides circulating in the CSF is greater than previously suggested and we also demonstrate that the mid-domain antibody used can serve as an additional tool for mapping a more complete Abeta degradation profile.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) is thought to play a pivotal role in the disease progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta directed immunotherapy has been considered an alternative AD treatment. In this study, we constructed a DNA vaccine, p(Abeta3-10)10-mIL-4, encoding ten tandem repeats of Abeta3-10 fused with mouse IL-4. Eight-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice were injected intramuscularly with p(Abeta3-10)10-mIL-4 followed by in vivo electroporation. Immunization with the vaccine induced high-titer anti-Abeta antibodies and attenuated the behavior impairment. Immunoglobulin isotyping revealed a predominantly IgG1 response and ex vivo cultured splenocytes exhibited a low IFN-gamma and high IL-4 response, indicating a Th2 anti-inflammatory response. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that p(Abeta3-10)10-mIL-4 immunization decreased Abeta deposition, and the microglial attraction significantly decreased accompanied by the clearance of Abeta. There was no microhemorrhage in the brain of the immunized mice. These results suggest that the immunization potentially reduced the inflammation in brain of transgenic mice and therefore improved their cognitive ability. This novel DNA vaccine p(Abeta3-10)10-mIL-4 may be an effective immunization method as therapy for AD.",

    "abstract": "Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN) are selectively vulnerable to damage and loss in a number of neurodegenerative disorders that afflict the elderly, particularly Alzheimer's disease. The reasons for this selective vulnerability remain poorly understood. Given that intraneuronal accumulation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has been shown to exert deleterious effects on neurons, we tested potential accumulation of Abeta within BFCN in rhesus monkeys, which like the human display age-related accumulation of this peptide in plaques. The non-isoform-specific Abeta antibodies 1282 and 6E10 and the specific antibodies to 1-40 amino acid isoform of Abeta (Abeta1-40) and 1-42 amino acid isoform of Abeta (Abeta1-42) species were used in immunohistochemical experiments of basal forebrain in young and aged rhesus monkeys. All four antibodies visualized cortical plaques in the same sections in which BFCN were examined, in aged but not in young animals. The basal forebrain region within which the BFCN are localized was virtually free of plaques. Appreciable Abeta immunoreactivity was present within the nucleus basalis of Meynert-cholinergic cell group 4 (nbM-Ch4), the major component of BFCN, with all antibodies used. Quantitation of optical density indicated significant age-related increases in immunoreactivity in nbM-Ch4 neurons with the Abeta1-40 (p<0.002) and 1282 (p<0.03) antibodies. Immunoreactivity for 6E10 displayed a small, non-significant age-related increase in nbM-Ch4 neurons (p>0.05). No age-related changes were detected in Abeta1-42 immunoreactivity in these neurons. Unlike the BFCN, cortical neurons within the same sections were virtually devoid of Abeta immunoreactivity, particularly with isoform-specific antibodies. Both smooth and granular intraneuronal Abeta immunoreactivity, reminiscent of endosomal/lysosomal packaged peptide, were observed within nbM-Ch4 neurons. In some nbM-Ch4 neurons, 1282 immunoreactivity had the appearance of large peptide aggregates. Significant accumulation and age-related increase of Abeta in BFCN is likely to interfere with the normal functioning of these neurons. It remains to be determined if similar accumulation of Abeta occurs in human BFCN.",

Many studies have indicated some association between these processes, but it remains unknown how the two pathologies are linked. In this study, we investigated whether expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) influences extracellular seed-dependent intracellular tau accumulation in cultured cells. Treatment of tau-expressing SH-SY5Y cells with Abeta fibrils did not induce intracellular tau aggregation. On the other hand, in cells expressing both tau and APP, treatment with tau fibrils or Sarkosyl-insoluble tau from AD brains induced intracellular tau aggregation. The seed-dependent intracellular tau aggregation was not induced by expression of APP lacking the extracellular domain. The amount of phosphorylated tau aggregates in cultured cells was dose dependently elevated in response to increased levels of APP on the cell membrane. Our results indicate that the extracellular region of APP is involved in uptake of tau fibrils into cells, raising the possibility that APP, but not Abeta, influences cell-to-cell spreading of tau pathologies in AD by serving as a receptor of abnormal tau aggregates.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a key pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) characterized by accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein in blood vessel walls. CAA impairs vessel functioning, affects blood brain barrier integrity and accelerates cognitive decline of AD patients. Unfortunately, mechanisms underlying Abeta deposition in the vessel wall remain largely unknown. Factor XIIIa (FXIIIa) is a blood-derived transglutaminase crucial in blood coagulation by cross-linking fibrin molecules. Evidence is mounting that blood-derived factors are present in CAA and may play a role in protein deposition in the vessel wall. We therefore investigated whether FXIIIa is present in CAA and if FXIIIa cross-link activity affects Abeta aggregation. METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of FXIIIa, its activator thrombin and in situ FXIIIa activity in CAA in post-mortem AD tissue. We used surface plasmon resonance and Western blot analysis to study binding of FXIIIa to Abeta and the formation of FXIIIa-Abeta complexes, respectively. In addition, we studied cytotoxicity of FXIIIa-Abeta complexes to cerebrovascular cells. RESULTS: FXIIIa, thrombin and in situ FXIIIa activity colocalize with the Abeta deposition in CAA. Furthermore, FXIIIa binds to Abeta with a higher binding affinity for Abeta1-42 compared with Abeta1-40 . Moreover, highly stable FXIIIa-Abeta complexes are formed independently of FXIIIa cross-linking activity that protected cerebrovascular cells from Abeta-induced toxicity in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that FXIIIa colocalizes with Abeta in CAA and that FXIIIa forms unique protein complexes with Abeta that might play an important role in Abeta deposition and persistence in the vessel wall.",

However, the extent of amyloid accumulation after clinical onset is not fully known. Importantly, regional PET data are typically quantified using the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), which according to simulations is sensitive to changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). We aimed to better understand the potentials of longitudinal amyloid imaging by disentangling the influence of blood flow on SUVR using experimental data. [18F]AV-45 PET data from 101 subjects, ranging from cognitively normal to AD patients, in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were extracted. The relationship between global cortical distribution volume ratio, indicator of rCBF (R1), and SUVR was examined using multilinear regression. There was a significant effect of rCBF on SUVR. The effect increased by disease severity. Results suggest that changes in rCBF can produce apparent changes in SUVR in AD. Therefore, future longitudinal studies should measure amyloid changes in a way not sensitive to this effect, ideally using quantitative PET imaging. Furthermore, the results suggest no true accumulation beyond clinical onset and highlight the risks of longitudinal amyloid imaging in drug trials in AD.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are likely the molecular cause of neurodegeneration observed in Alzheimer's disease. In the brain, Abeta42 and Abeta40 are toxic and the most important proteolytic fragments generated through sequential processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. Impeding the generation of Abeta42 and Abeta40 is thus considered as a promising strategy to prevent Alzheimer's disease. We therefore wanted to determine key parameters of the APP transmembrane sequence enabling production of these Abeta species. Here we show that the hydrophilicity of amino acid residues G33, T43, and T48 critically determines the generation of Abeta42 and Abeta40 peptides (amino acid numbering according to Abeta nomenclature starting with aspartic acid 1). First, we performed a comprehensive mutational analysis of glycine residue G33 positioned within the N-terminal half of the APP transmembrane sequence by exchanging it against the 19 other amino acids. We found that hydrophilicity of the residue at position 33 positively correlated with Abeta42 and Abeta40 generation. Second, we analyzed two threonine residues at positions T43 and T48 in the C-terminal half of the APP-transmembrane sequence. Replacement of single threonine residues by hydrophobic valines inversely affected Abeta42 and Abeta40 generation. We observed that threonine mutants affected the initial gamma-secretase cut, which is associated with levels of Abeta42 or Abeta40. Overall, hydrophilic residues of the APP transmembrane sequence decide on the exact initial gamma-cut and the amounts of Abeta42 and Abeta40.",

In other disorders with neuronal hyperexcitability, dysfunction in the dendrites often contributes, but dendritic excitability has not been directly examined in AD models. We used dendritic patch-clamp recordings to measure dendritic excitability in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. We found that dendrites, more so than somata, of hippocampal neurons were hyperexcitable in mice overexpressing Abeta. This dendritic hyperexcitability was associated with depletion of Kv4.2, a dendritic potassium channel important for regulating dendritic excitability and synaptic plasticity. The antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam, blocked Kv4.2 depletion. Tau was required, as crossing with tau knock-out mice also prevented both Kv4.2 depletion and dendritic hyperexcitability. Dendritic hyperexcitability induced by Kv4.2 deficiency exacerbated behavioral deficits and increased epileptiform activity in hAPP mice. We conclude that increased dendritic excitability, associated with changes in dendritic ion channels including Kv4.2, may contribute to neuronal dysfunction in early stages AD.",

Several properties characteristics of infectious prions have been shown for the induction of Abeta aggregates. However, a detailed titration of Abeta misfolding transmissibility and estimation of the minimum concentration of biologically active Abeta seeds able to accelerate pathological changes has not yet been performed. In this study, brain extracts from old tg2576 animals were serially diluted and intra-cerebrally injected into young subjects from the same transgenic line. Animals were sacrificed several months after treatment and brain slices were analyzed for amyloid pathology. We observed that administration of misfolded Abeta was able to significantly accelerate amyloid deposition in young mice, even when the original sample was diluted a million times. The titration curve obtained in this experiment was compared to the natural Abeta load spontaneously accumulated by these mice overtime. Our findings suggest that administration of the largest dose of Abeta seeds led to an acceleration of pathology equivalent to over a year. These results show that active Abeta seeds present in the brain can seed amyloidosis in a titratable manner, similarly as observed for infectious prions.",

Abeta capture by these clinical antibodies is explained here with the first reported mid-region Abeta-anti-Abeta complex crystal structure. Solanezumab accommodates a large Abeta epitope (960 A(2) buried interface over residues 16 to 26) that forms extensive contacts and hydrogen bonds to the antibody, largely via main-chain Abeta atoms and a deeply buried Phe19-Phe20 dipeptide core. The conformation of Abeta captured is an intermediate between observed sheet and helical forms with intramolecular hydrogen bonds stabilising residues 20-26 in a helical conformation. Remarkably, Abeta-binding residues are almost perfectly conserved in crenezumab. The structure explains the observed shared cross reactivity of solanezumab and crenezumab with proteins abundant in plasma that exhibit this Phe-Phe dipeptide.",

    "abstract": "Agonists of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are currently being considered as therapeutic approaches for managing cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Present study was designed to evaluate the effect of alpha7 nAChR selective activation by PHA-543613 (PHA) on beta-amyloid (Abeta)25-35-mediated cognitive deficits in mice. For this purpose, PHA (1mg/kg, i.p.), a selective alpha7 nAChR agonist, and galantamine (Gal) (3mg/kg, s.c.), an acetylcholine-esterase inhibitor (AChEI) effects on alpha7 nAChR were tested in Abeta25-35-received (intracerebroventricular, 10 nmol) mice model of AD. Methyllycaconitine (MLA) (1mg/kg, i.p.), a alpha7 nAChR antagonist, was used for receptor blockage effects evaluation. Working and reference memory in animals was assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM) task. The mRNA and protein levels of alpha7 subunit were analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. PHA and Gal, ameliorate Abeta-impaired working and reference memory. However, Gal had less effect than PHA in this regard. Pretreatment with MLA reverses both Gal and PHA effects in MWM. PHA and Gal treatment prevent Abeta-induced alpha7 subunit protein reduction, but Gal has lesser effect than PHA. This effect blocked by pretreatment with MLA. In neither the pretreatment nor treatment group, the mRNA levels of nAChR alpha7 subunit were significantly changed. Therefore, alpha7 nAChR activation, reduces Abeta-induced cognitive deficits and increases the alpha7 protein level and subsequent neuron survival. However, blockage of receptor, increases Abeta toxicity and cognitive impairment and reduces the alpha7 nAChR protein level and flowing neuroprotection.",

    "title": "Blood Protein Markers of Neocortical Amyloid-beta Burden: A Candidate Study Using SOMAscan Technology.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Four previously reported studies have tested for association of blood proteins with neocortical amyloid-beta burden (NAB). If shown to be robust, these proteins could have utility as a blood test for enrichment in clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether previously identified blood proteins also show evidence for association with NAB in serum samples from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL). The study considers candidate proteins seen in cohorts other than AIBL and candidates previously discovered in the AIBL cohort. METHODS: Our study used the SOMAscan platform for protein quantification in blood serum. Linear and logistic regressions were used to model continuous NAB and dichotomized NAB respectively using single proteins as a predictor. Multiple protein models were built using stepwise regression techniques and support vectors machines. Age and APOEe4 carriage were used as covariates for all analysis. RESULTS: Of the 41 proteins previously reported, 15 AIBL candidates and 20 non-AIBL candidates were available for testing. Of these candidates, pancreatic polypeptide (PPY) and IgM showed a significant association with NAB. Notably, IgM was found to associate with continuous NAB across cognitively normal control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: We have further demonstrated the association of PPY and IgM with NAB, despite technical differences between studies. There are several reasons for a lack of significance for the other candidates including platform differences and the use of serum rather than plasma samples. To investigate the possibility of technical differences causing lack of replication, further studies are required.",

Here, we demonstrate that EGCG reduced beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation in vitro and rescued cognitive deterioration in senescence-accelerated mice P8 (SAMP8) via intragastric administration of low- and high-dose EGCG (5 and 15 mg/kg, respectively) for 60 days. The AD brain has decreased levels of the rate-limiting degradation enzyme of Abeta, neprilysin (NEP). We found an association between EGCG-induced reduction in Abeta accumulation and elevated NEP expression. Further, NEP silencing prevented the EGCG-induced Abeta downregulation.

    "title": "Determining the role of IL-4 induced neuroinflammation in microglial activity and amyloid-beta using BV2 microglial cells and APP/PS1 transgenic mice.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Microglia are considered the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). In response to harmful stimuli, an inflammatory reaction ensues in which microglia are activated in a sequenced spectrum of pro- and antiinflammatory phenotypes that are akin to the well-characterized polarization states of peripheral macrophages. A \"classically\" activated M1 phenotype is known to eradicate toxicity. The transition to an \"alternatively\" activated M2 phenotype encompasses neuroprotection and repair. In recent years, inflammation has been considered an accompanying pathology in response to the accumulation of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to drive an M2a-biased immune phenotype with IL-4 in vitro and in vivo and to determine the subsequent effects on microglial activation and Abeta pathology. METHODS: In vitro, exogenous IL-4 was applied to BV2 microglial cell cultures to evaluate the temporal progression of microglial responses. In vivo, intracranial injections of an adeno-associate-virus (AAV) viral vector were performed to assess long-term expression of IL-4 in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of Abeta-depositing, APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to assess the fold change in expression of biomarkers representing each of the microglial phenotypes in both the animal tissue and the BV2 cells. ELISAs quantified IL-4 expression and Abeta levels. Histological staining permitted quantification of microglial and astrocytic activity. RESULTS: Both in vitro and in vivo models showed an enhanced M2a phenotype, and the in vivo model revealed a trend toward a decreased trend in Abeta deposition. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this study offers insight into the therapeutic potential of microglial immune response in AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tong Luo Jiu Nao (TLJN), a modern formula of Chinese medicine extracts on the basis of Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, has been used to treat dementia. The present study aimed to investigate its ameliorating effects on Abeta1-40-induced cognitive impairment in rats using a series of novel reward-directed instrumental learning (RDIL) tasks, and to determine its possible mechanism of action. METHODS: Rats were pretreated with TLJN extract (0.9 and 1.8 g/kg, p.o.) for 10 daysbefore surgery, and were trained to gain reward reinforcement by lever pressing at the meantime. Thereafter, rats received a bilateral microinjection of Abeta1-40 in CA1 regions of the hippocampus. Cognitive performance was evaluated with the goal directed (higher response ratio) and habit (visual signal discrimination and extinction) learning tasks, as well as on the levels of biochemical parameters and molecules. RESULTS: Our findings first demonstrated that TLJN can improve Abeta1-40-induced amnesia in RDIL via enhancing the comprehension of action-outcome association and the utilization of cue information to guide behavior. Then, its ameliorating effects should attribute to the modulation of ERK/CaMKII/CREB signaling in the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: TLJN can markedly enhance cognitions of Abeta1-40 microinjection animal model in adaptive behavioral tasks. It has the potential, possibly as complementary and alternative therapy, to prevent and/or delay the deterioration of cognitive impairment in AD.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the molecular structures of amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers and underlying assembly pathways will advance our understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) at the molecular level. This understanding could contribute to disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies, as oligomers play a central role in AD pathology. We have recently presented a procedure for production of 150-kDa oligomeric samples of Abeta(1-42) (the 42-residue variant of the Abeta peptide) that are compatible with solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, and we have shown that these oligomers and amyloid fibrils differ in intermolecular arrangement of beta-strands. Here we report new solid-state NMR constraints that indicate antiparallel intermolecular alignment of beta-strands within the oligomers. Specifically, 150-kDa Abeta(1-42) oligomers with uniform (13)C and (15)N isotopic labels at I32, M35, G37, and V40 exhibit beta-strand secondary chemical shifts in 2-dimensional (2D) finite-pulse radiofrequency-driven recoupling NMR spectra, spatial proximities between I32 and V40 as well as between M35 and G37 in 2D dipolar-assisted rotational resonance spectra, and close proximity between M35 H(alpha) and G37 H(alpha) in 2D CHHC spectra. Furthermore, 2D dipolar-assisted rotational resonance analysis of an oligomer sample prepared with 30% labeled peptide indicates that the I32-V40 and M35-G37 contacts are between residues on different molecules. We employ molecular modeling to compare the newly derived experimental constraints with previously proposed geometries for arrangement of Abeta molecules into oligomers.",

    "title": "Redox proteomics identification of specifically carbonylated proteins in the hippocampi of triple transgenic Alzheimer's disease mice at its earliest pathological stage.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly population. Attempts to develop therapies for the treatment of the late stage AD have been unsuccessful. Increasing evidences indicate that oxidative stress is an early event of neurodegeneration, however the pathogenic mechanism of AD remains unclarified. In the present study, slot-blot analysis was used to determine the levels of protein carbonyls in the hippocampi of 3-month-old triple transgenic AD mice (3 x Tg-AD). The increased levels of protein carbonyls were observed in the hippocampi of 3 x Tg-AD mice as compared to the non-transgenic controls (non-Tg). Using a redox-proteomic approach, twelve proteins were found to be significantly altered in the levels of protein carbonyls in the hippocampus. These proteins are crucial in energy metabolism, protein folding, cell structure, signal transduction and excitotoxicity. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot were used to validate two proteins identified by the redox proteomics. In addition, increased expression level of carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) was observed in the hippocampi of 3 x Tg-AD mice. These results demonstrate that significant protein carbonylation occurs early in the 3-month-old 3 x Tg-AD mice, which support the viewpoint that oxidative stress is an early event in AD progression. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we have observed increased levels of protein carbonyls in the hippocampi of 3 x Tg-AD mice before the appearance of Abeta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). By redox proteomics, twelve specifically carbonylated proteins were identified. Among them, alpha-enolase (ENO1) and glutamine synthetase (GS) were identified as the common targets of oxidation in the brains of 3 x Tg-AD mice, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) sufferers and AD patients. For the first time, the oxidation of t-complex protein 1 subunit epsilon (CCT5) and protein disulfide-isomerase A3 (PDIA3) were reported to be associated with AD. These results indicated that the combination of monoclonal anti-DNP antibody with digital imaging system could enhance the specificity and accuracy of redox proteomics analysis. Those data support the viewpoint that oxidative stress occurs at the early pathological stage of AD. In addition, this paper provides new information for understanding the pathological process of AD and for developing more appropriate therapies to intervene AD progression.",

    "abstract": "AIM: The proteolytic cleavage of Tau is involved in Abeta-induced neuronal dysfunction and cell death. In this study, we investigated whether atorvastatin could prevent Tau cleavage and hence prevent Abeta1-42 oligomer (AbetaO)-induced neurotoxicity in cultured cortical neurons. METHODS: Cultured rat hippocampal neurons were incubated in the presence of AbetaOs (1.25 mumol/L) with or without atorvastatin pretreatment. ATP content and LDH in the culture medium were measured to assess the neuronal viability. Caspase-3/7 and calpain protease activities were detected. The levels of phospho-Akt, phospho-Erk1/2, phospho-GSK3beta, p35 and Tau proteins were measured using Western blotting. RESULTS: Treatment of the neurons with AbetaO significantly decreased the neuronal viability, induced rapid activation of calpain and caspase-3/7 proteases, accompanied by Tau degradation and relatively stable fragments generated in the neurons. AbetaO also suppressed Akt and Erk1/2 kinase activity, while increased GSK3beta and Cdk5 activity in the neurons. Pretreatment with atorvastatin (0.5, 1, 2.5 mumol/L) dose-dependently inhibited AbetaO-induced activation of calpain and caspase-3/7 proteases, and effectively diminished the generation of Tau fragments, attenuated synaptic damage and increased neuronal survival. Atorvastatin pretreatment also prevented AbetaO-induced decreases in Akt and Erk1/2 kinase activity and the increases in GSK3beta and Cdk5 kinase activity. CONCLUSION: Atorvastatin prevents AbetaO-induced neurotoxicity in cultured rat hippocampal neurons by inhibiting calpain- and caspase-mediated Tau cleavage.",

    "abstract": "The BRICHOS domain is associated with human amyloid disease, and it efficiently prevents amyloid fibril formation of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in vitro and in vivo. Recombinant human prosurfactant protein C (proSP-C) BRICHOS domain forms a homotrimer as observed by x-ray crystallography, analytical ultracentrifugation, native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, analytical size exclusion chromatography and electrospray mass spectrometry. It was hypothesized that the trimer is an inactive storage form, as a putative substrate-binding site identified in the monomer, is buried in the subunit interface of the trimer. We show here increased dissociation of the BRICHOS trimer into monomers, by addition of detergents or of bis-ANS, known to bind to the putative substrate-binding site, or by introducing a Ser to Arg mutation expected to interfere with trimer formation. This leads to increased capacity to delay Abeta(42) fibril formation. Cross-linking of the BRICHOS trimer with glutaraldehyde, in contrast, renders it unable to affect Abeta(42) fibril formation. Moreover, proSP-C BRICHOS expressed in HEK293 cells is mainly monomeric, as detected by proximity ligation assay. Finally, proteolytic cleavage of BRICHOS in a loop region that is cleaved during proSP-C biosynthesis results in increased capacity to delay Abeta(42) fibril formation. These results indicate that modulation of the accessibility of the substrate-binding site is a means to regulate BRICHOS activity.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Pathological studies suggest that neuroinflammation is exacerbated by increased beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels in the brain early in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The time course and relationships between astrocytosis and Abeta deposition were examined using multitracer in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in an AD transgenic mouse model, followed by postmortem autoradiography and immunohistochemistry analysis. METHODS: PET imaging with the amyloid plaque tracer (11)C-AZD2184 and the astroglial tracer (11)C-deuterium-L-deprenyl ((11)C-DED) was carried out in APPswe mice aged 6, 8-15 and 18-24 months (4-6 animals/group) and in wild-type (wt) mice aged 8-15 and 18-24 months (3-6 animals/group). Tracer uptake was quantified by region of interest analysis using PMOD software and a 3-D digital mouse brain atlas. Postmortem brain tissues from the same APPswe and wt mice in all age groups were analysed for Abeta deposition and astrocytosis by in vitro autoradiography using (3)H-AZD2184, (3)H-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) and (3)H-L-deprenyl and immunostaining performed with antibodies for Abeta42 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in sagittal brain sections. RESULTS: (11)C-AZD2184 PET retention in the cerebral cortices of APPswe mice was significantly higher at 18-24 months than in age-matched wt mice. Cortical and hippocampal (11)C-DED PET binding was significantly higher at 6 months than at 8-15 months or 18-24 months in APPswe mice, and it was also higher than at 8-15 months in wt mice. In vitro autoradiography (3)H-AZD2184 and (3)H-PIB binding confirmed the in vivo findings with (11)C-AZD2184 and demonstrated age-dependent increases in Abeta deposition in APPswe cortex and hippocampus. There were no significant differences between APPswe and wt mice in (3)H-L-deprenyl autoradiography binding across age groups. Immunohistochemical quantification demonstrated more Abeta42 deposits in the cortex and hippocampus and more GFAP(+) reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus at 18-24 months than at 6 months in APPswe mice. CONCLUSION: The findings provide further in vivo evidence that astrocytosis occurs early in AD, preceding Abeta plaque deposition.",

    "title": "TREM2 sustains microglial expansion during aging and response to demyelination.",
    "abstract": "Microglia contribute to development, homeostasis, and immunity of the CNS. Like other tissue-resident macrophage populations, microglia express the surface receptor triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which binds polyanions, such as dextran sulphate and bacterial LPS, and activates downstream signaling cascades through the adapter DAP12. Individuals homozygous for inactivating mutations in TREM2 exhibit demyelination of subcortical white matter and a lethal early onset dementia known as Nasu-Hakola disease. How TREM2 deficiency mediates demyelination and disease is unknown. Here, we addressed the basis for this genetic association using Trem2(-/-) mice. In WT mice, microglia expanded in the corpus callosum with age, whereas aged Trem2(-/-) mice had fewer microglia with an abnormal morphology. In the cuprizone model of oligodendrocyte degeneration and demyelination, Trem2(-/-) microglia failed to amplify transcripts indicative of activation, phagocytosis, and lipid catabolism in response to myelin damage. As a result, Trem2(-/-) mice exhibited impaired myelin debris clearance, axonal dystrophy, oligodendrocyte reduction, and persistent demyelination after prolonged cuprizone treatment. Moreover, myelin-associated lipids robustly triggered TREM2 signaling in vitro, suggesting that TREM2 may directly sense lipid components exposed during myelin damage. We conclude that TREM2 is required for promoting microglial expansion during aging and microglial response to insults of the white matter.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Although advancing age is the strongest risk factor for the development of symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD), recent studies have shown that there are individual differences in susceptibility to age-related alterations in the biomarkers of AD pathophysiology. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether cognitive reserve (CR) modifies the adverse influence of age on key cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional cohort of 268 individuals (211 in a cognitively normal group and 57 in a cognitively impaired group) from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention and the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center participated in this study. They underwent lumbar puncture for collection of CSF samples, from which Abeta42, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) were immunoassayed. In addition, we computed t-tau/Abeta42 and p-tau/Abeta42 ratios. Cognitive reserve was indexed by years of education, with 16 or more years taken to confer high reserve. Covariate-adjusted regression analyses were used to test whether the effect of age on CSF biomarkers was modified by CR. The study dates were March 5, 2010, to February 13, 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cerebrospinal fluid levels of Abeta42, t-tau, p-tau, t-tau/Abeta42, and p-tau/Abeta42. RESULTS: There were significant age x CR interactions for CSF t-tau (beta [SE] = -6.72 [2.84], P = .02), p-tau (beta [SE] = -0.71 [0.27], P = .01), t-tau/Abeta42 (beta [SE] = -0.02 [0.01], P = .02), and p-tau/Abeta42 (beta [SE] = -0.002 [0.001], P = .004). With advancing age, individuals with high CR exhibited attenuated adverse alterations in these CSF biomarkers compared with individuals with low CR. This attenuation of age effects by CR tended to be more pronounced in the cognitively impaired group compared with the cognitively normal group. There was evidence of a dose-response relationship such that the effect of age on the biomarkers was progressively attenuated given additional years of schooling. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a sample composed of a cognitively normal group and a cognitively impaired group, higher CR was associated with a diminution of age-related alterations in CSF biomarkers of AD. This suggests one pathway through which CR might favorably alter lifetime risk for symptomatic AD.",

    "title": "ATP leakage induces P2XR activation and contributes to acute synaptic excitotoxicity induced by soluble oligomers of beta-amyloid peptide in hippocampal neurons.",
    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that the toxic effects of Abeta can be attributed to its capability to insert in membranes and form pore-like structures, which are permeable to cations and molecules such as ATP. Our working hypothesis is that Abeta increases extracellular ATP causing activation of P2X receptors and potentiating excitatory synaptic activity. We found that soluble oligomers of beta-amyloid peptide increased cytosolic Ca(2+) 4-fold above control (415 +- 28% of control). Also, ATP leakage (157 +- 10% of control) was independent of extracellular Ca(2+), suggesting that ATP traveled from the cytosol through an Abeta pore-mediated efflux and not from exocytotic mechanisms. The subsequent activation of P2XR by ATP can contribute to the cytosolic Ca(2+) increase observed with Abeta. Additionally, we found that beta-amyloid oligomers bind preferentially to excitatory neurons inducing an increase in excitatory synaptic current frequency (248.1 +- 32.7%) that was blocked by the use of P2XR antagonists such as PPADS (Abeta + PPADS: 110.9 +- 18.35%) or Apyrase plus DPCPX (Abeta + inhibitors: 98.97 +- 17.4%). Taken together, we suggest that Abeta induces excitotoxicity by binding preferentially to excitatory neuron membranes forming a non-selective pore and by increasing intracellular calcium by itself and through P2XR activation by extracellular ATP leading to an augmention in mEPSC activity. All these effects were blocked with a non-specific P2XR antagonist, indicating that part of the neurotoxicity of Abeta is mediated by P2XR activation and facilitation of excitatory neurotransmitter release. These findings suggest that P2XR can be considered as a potential new target for the development of drugs or pharmacological tools to treat Alzheimer's disease.

    "title": "Sequential Amyloid-beta Degradation by the Matrix Metalloproteases MMP-2 and MMP-9.",
    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) MMP-2 and MMP-9 have been implicated in the physiological catabolism of Alzheimer's amyloid-beta (Abeta). Conversely, their association with vascular amyloid deposits, blood-brain barrier disruption, and hemorrhagic transformations after ischemic stroke also highlights their involvement in pathological processes. To better understand this dichotomy, recombinant human (rh) MMP-2 and MMP-9 were incubated with Abeta40 and Abeta42, and the resulting proteolytic fragments were assessed via immunoprecipitation and quantitative mass spectrometry. Both MMPs generated Abeta fragments truncated only at the C terminus, ending at positions 34, 30, and 16. Using deuterated homologues as internal standards, we observed limited and relatively slow degradation of Abeta42 by rhMMP-2, although the enzyme cleaved >80% of Abeta40 during the 1st h of incubation. rhMMP-9 was significantly less effective, particularly in degrading Abeta(1-42), although the targeted peptide bonds were identical. Using Abeta(1-34) and Abeta(1-30), we demonstrated that these peptides are also substrates for both MMPs, cleaving Abeta(1-34) to produce Abeta(1-30) first and Abeta(1-16) subsequently. Consistent with the kinetics observed with full-length Abeta, rhMMP-9 degraded only a minute fraction of Abeta(1-34) and was even less effective in producing Abeta(1-16). Further degradation of Abeta(1-16) by either MMP-2 or MMP-9 was not observed even after prolonged incubation times. Notably, all MMP-generated C-terminally truncated Abeta fragments were highly soluble and did not exhibit fibrillogenic properties or induce cytotoxicity in human cerebral microvascular endothelial or neuronal cells supporting the notion that these truncated Abeta species are associated with clearance mechanisms rather than being key elements in the fibrillogenesis process.",

    "abstract": "Protein misfolded proteins are among the most toxic endogenous species of macromolecules. These chemical entities are responsible for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Creutzfeldt-Jakob's and different non-neurophatic amyloidosis. Notably, these oligomers show a combination of marked heterogeneity and low abundance in body fluids, which have prevented a reliable detection by immunological methods so far. Herein we exploit the selectivity of proteins to react with metallic ions and the sensitivity of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) toward small electronic changes in coordination compounds to design and engineer a reliable optical sensor for protein misfolded oligomers. Our strategy relies on the functionalization of Au nanoparticle-decorated polystyrene beads with an effective metallorganic Raman chemoreceptor, composed by Al(3+) ions coordinated to 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA) with high Raman cross-section, that selectively binds aberrant protein oligomers. The mechanical deformations of the MBA phenyl ring upon complexation with the oligomeric species are registered in its SERS spectrum and can be quantitatively correlated with the concentration of the target biomolecule. The SERS platform used here appears promising for future implementation of diagnostic tools of aberrant species associated with protein deposition diseases, including those with a strong social and economic impact, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid disorders cause debilitating illnesses through the formation of toxic protein aggregates. The mechanisms of amyloid toxicity and the nature of species responsible for mediating cellular dysfunction remain unclear. Here, using beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) as a model system, we show that the disruption of membranes by amyloid fibrils is caused by the molecular shedding of membrane-active oligomers in a process that is dependent on pH. Using thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, NMR, EM and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), we show that fibril disassembly at pH 6.4 results in the formation of nonnative spherical oligomers that disrupt synthetic membranes. By contrast, fibril dissociation at pH 7.4 results in the formation of nontoxic, native monomers. Chemical cross-linking or interaction with hsp70 increases the kinetic stability of fibrils and decreases their capacity to cause membrane disruption and cellular dysfunction. The results demonstrate how pH can modulate the deleterious effects of preformed amyloid aggregates and suggest why endocytic trafficking through acidic compartments may be a key factor in amyloid disease.",

    "title": "Apolipoprotein E Inhibits Cerebrovascular Pericyte Mobility through a RhoA Protein-mediated Pathway.",
    "abstract": "Pericytes play a critical role in the cerebrovasculature within the CNS. These small contractile cells produce large quantities of apolipoprotein E (apoE) whose isoforms influence cerebrovascular functions and determine the genetic risk for Alzheimer disease. Despite extensive studies on astrocyte-secreted apoE, which supports synapses by transporting cholesterol to neurons, the biochemical properties and function of apoE secreted by pericytes are not clear. Because pericytes mediate important functions in the CNS, including the initiation of glial scar formation, angiogenesis, and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, we investigated the potential role of apoE in pericyte mobility. We found that knockdown of apoE expression significantly accelerates pericyte migration, an effect that can be rescued by exogenous apoE3, but not apoE4, a risk factor for Alzheimer disease. ApoE-regulated migration of pericytes also requires the function of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), a major apoE receptor in the brain that is abundantly expressed in pericytes. Because apoE-knockdown also leads to enhanced cell adhesion, we investigated the role of apoE in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, we found that the levels of active RhoA are increased significantly in apoE knockdown pericytes and that RhoA inhibitors blocked pericyte migration. Taken together, our results suggest that apoE has an intrinsic role in pericyte mobility, which is vital in maintaining cerebrovascular function. These findings provide novel insights into the role of apoE in the cerebrovascular system.",

    "abstract": "Overexpression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein are vital in the understanding of the cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a consequence, regulation of the expression of both APP and tau proteins is one important approach in combating AD. The APP and tau proteins can be targeted at the levels of transcription, translation and protein structural integrity. This paper reports the utilization of a bi-cistronic vector containing either APP or tau internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements flanked by beta-galactosidase gene (cap-dependent) and secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) (cap-independent) to discern the mechanism of action of memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. Results indicate that memantine could reduce the activity of both the APP and tau IRES at a concentration of ~10 muM (monitored by SEAP activity) without interfering with the cap-dependent translation as monitored by the beta-galactosidase assay. Western blot analysis of the tau protein in neuroblastoma (N2A) and rat hippocampal cells confirmed the halting of the expression of the tau proteins. We also employed this approach to identify a preparation named NB34, extracts of Boussingaultia baselloides (madeira-vine) fermented with Lactobacillus spp., which can function similarly to memantine in both IRES of APP and Tau. The water maze test demonstrated that NB34 could improve the spatial memory of a high fat diet induced neurodegeneration in apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE-/-) mice. These results revealed that the bi-cistronic vector provided a simple, and effective platform in screening and establishing the mechanistic action of potential compounds for the treatment and management of AD.",

However, the identity and role of each molecular player and event, as well as how such a programme is modified by environmental signals, remain a focus of research. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a neuromodulator of the developing and mature nervous system, although in a highly complex manner which is far from clear. To study APP-induced neuritogenesis, the retinoic acid (RA)-induced SH-SY5Y cell differentiation model was first minutely characterized in terms of RA dose, morphological outputs and relevant biochemical markers. The findings reported here unveiled two differentiation phases for the 10 muM RA dose: 1-4 (4 days excluded) and 4-8 days, clearly defined by fold increases in the ratio between APP and acetylated Tubulin. Moreover, we describe, for the first time, a unique peak of secreted APP (sAPP)/APP ratio in the first phase. Subsequent APP and sAPP modulations confirmed that a high sAPP/APP ratio potentiates the elongation of smaller processes at the earlier neuritogenic phase. This sAPP/APP ratio drops in the second phase, as holoAPP levels increase to assist the maintenance of the longer neurites, potentially via their stabilization.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and familial Danish dementia (FDD) are degenerative neurological diseases characterized by amyloid pathology. Normal human sera contain IgG antibodies that specifically bind diverse preamyloid and amyloid proteins and have shown therapeutic potential in vitro and in vivo. We cloned one of these antibodies, 3H3, from memory B cells of a healthy individual using a hybridoma method. 3H3 is an affinity-matured IgG that binds a pan-amyloid epitope, recognizing both Abeta and lambda Ig light chain (LC) amyloids, which are associated with AD and primary amyloidosis, respectively. The pan-amyloid-binding properties of 3H3 were demonstrated using ELISA, immunohistochemical studies, and competition binding assays. Functional studies showed that 3H3 inhibits both Abeta and LC amyloid formation in vitro and abrogates disruption of hippocampal synaptic plasticity by AD-patient-derived soluble Abeta in vivo. A 3H3 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) retained the binding specificity of the 3H3 IgG and, when expressed in the brains of transgenic mice using an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, decreased parenchymal Abeta amyloid deposition in TgCRND8 mice and ADan (Danish Amyloid) cerebral amyloid angiopathy in the mouse model of FDD. These data indicate that naturally occurring human IgGs can recognize a conformational, amyloid-specific epitope and have potent anti-amyloid activities, providing a rationale to test their potential as antibody therapeutics for diverse neurological and other amyloid diseases.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a robust inflammatory response elicited by the accumulation and subsequent deposition of amyloid (Abeta) within the brain. The brain's immune cells migrate to and invest their processes within Abeta plaques but are unable to efficiently phagocytose and clear plaques from the brain. Previous studies have shown that treatment of myeloid cells with nuclear receptor agonists increases expression of phagocytosis-related genes. In this study, we elucidate a novel mechanism by which nuclear receptors act to enhance phagocytosis in the AD brain. Treatment of murine models of AD with agonists of the nuclear receptors PPARgamma, PPARdelta, LXR, and RXR stimulated microglial phagocytosis in vitro and rapidly induced the expression of the phagocytic receptors Axl and MerTK. In murine models of AD, we found that plaque-associated macrophages expressed Axl and MerTK and treatment of the cells with an RXR agonist further induced their expression, coincident with the rapid reduction in plaque burden. Further characterization of MerTK(+)/Axl(+) macrophages revealed that they also expressed the phagocytic receptor TREM2 and high levels of CD45, consistent with a peripheral origin of these cells. Importantly, in an ex vivo slice assay, nuclear receptor agonist treatment reversed the AD-related suppression of phagocytosis through a MerTK-dependent mechanism. Thus, nuclear receptor agonists increase MerTK and Axl expression on plaque-associated immune cells, consequently licensing their phagocytic activity and promoting plaque clearance.",

    "abstract": "While amyloid beta (Abeta) plays a central role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), recent evidence suggests the involvement of arginine metabolism in AD pathogenesis. Earlier research has shown that a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of pre-aggregated Abeta25-35 (the neurotoxic domain of the full-length Abeta) altered arginine metabolism in the rat hippocampus (particularly the CA2/3 and dentate gyrus (DG) sub-regions) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) at the time point of 8 days post-infusion. The present study measured the levels of L-arginine and its nine downstream metabolites (L-citrulline, L-ornithine, agmatine, putrescine, spermidine, spermine, glutamate, GABA and glutamine) in the hippocampus and PFC at the time points of 42 and 97 days following a single bilateral i.c.v. infusion of Abeta25-35 (30 nmol/rat) or Abeta35-25 (reverse peptide; 30 nmol/rat). At the 42-day time point, Abeta25-35 resulted in decreased levels of glutamate, glutamine and spermine in the CA2/3 sub-region of the hippocampus. At the 97-day time point, however, there were decreased L-ornithine, GABA and putrescine levels, but increased glutamate/GABA ratio, in the PFC and increased spermine levels in the DG sub-region. Cluster analyses showed that L-arginine and its three main metabolites L-citrulline, L-ornithine and agmatine formed distinct groups, which changed as a function of Abeta25-35 at the 42-day and 97-day time points, particularly in the CA2/3 and PFC regions respectively. This study, for the first time, demonstrates that a single i.c.v. infusion of pre-aggregated Abeta25-35 leads to prolonged alterations in arginine metabolism in a region-specific and time-dependent manner, which further supports the involvement of arginine metabolism in AD pathogenesis.",

One main reason is due to the poorly understood mechanism of Abeta peptide aggregation, which plays a crucial role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. It remains challenging to experimentally or theoretically characterize the secondary and tertiary structures of the Abeta monomer because of its high flexibility and aggregation propensity, and its conformations that lead to the aggregation are not fully identified. In this review, we highlight various structural ensembles of Abeta peptide revealed and characterized by computational approaches in order to find converging structures of Abeta monomer.

    "abstract": "Aging represents a major risk factor for numerous illnesses that are of increasing importance to society, including two of the most prevalent: diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Studies have shown that diabetes is a risk factor for spontaneous Alzheimer's disease. While these studies suggest that diabetes can contribute to Alzheimer's disease, the implications of AD on diabetes are practically unexplored. The major mediator of the pathophysiological effects, the Abeta42 peptide, has been shown to enter neurons and lead to an alteration of the intracellular distribution of the molecular motor myosin Vb. Myosin Vb functions in memory and learning by participating in the strengthening of the long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmissions. It has also been implicated in the translocation of the glucose transporter, GLUT4, to the plasma membrane in response to insulin, a process that is defective in diabetes. Here, the effect on GLUT4 upon entry of the Abeta42 peptide into cultured chick retinal neurons was explored. The results suggest an alteration in distribution and a reduced level at the cell surface, as well as an increased colocalization with myosin Vb, which can partially explain the changes in glucose metabolism associated with AD. It is also shown that the presence of the Abeta40 peptide inhibits the internalization of the Abeta42 peptide in cultured cells. Together, the results provide additional targets for the development of therapeutics against the progression and effects of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease clinically characterized by progressive cognitive dysfunction. Deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is the most important pathophysiological hallmark of AD. Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species is prominent in AD, and several reports suggest the relationship between a change in redox status and AD pathology containing progressive Abeta deposition, the activation of glial cells, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, we performed immunohistochemical analysis using a transgenic mouse model of AD (APdE9) and evaluated the activity of superoxide dismutase in brain tissue homogenates of APdE9 mice in vitro. Together with those analyses, in vivo changes in redox status with age in both wild-type (WT) and APdE9 mouse brains were measured noninvasively by three-dimensional electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging using nitroxide (3-methoxycarbonyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine-1-yloxy) as a redox-sensitive probe. Both methods found similar changes in redox status with age, and in particular a significant change in redox status in the hippocampus was observed noninvasively by EPR imaging between APdE9 mice and age-matched WT mice from 9 to 18 months of age. EPR imaging clearly visualized the accelerated change in redox status of APdE9 mouse brain compared with WT. The evaluation of the redox status in the brain of AD model rodents by EPR imaging should be useful for diagnostic study of AD.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid deposits to the islets of Langerhans are responsible for the gradual loss of pancreatic beta-cells leading to type II diabetes mellitus. Human mature islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), a 37-residue pancreatic hormone, has been identified as the primary component of amyloid fibrils forming these deposits. Several individual segments along the entire sequence length of hIAPP have been nominated as regions with increased amyloidogenic potential, such as regions 8-20, 20-29, and 30-37. A smaller fragment of the 8-20 region, spanning residues 8-16 of hIAPP has been associated with the formation of early transient alpha-helical dimers that promote fibrillogenesis and also as a core part of hIAPP amyloid fibrils. Utilizing our aggregation propensity prediction tools AmylPred and AmylPred2, we have identified the high aggregation propensity of the 8-16 segment of hIAPP. A peptide analog corresponding to this segment was chemically synthesized and its amyloidogenic properties were validated using electron microscopy, X-ray fiber diffraction, ATR FT-IR spectroscopy, and polarized microscopy. Additionally, two peptides introducing point mutations L12R and L12P, respectively, to the 8-16 segment, were chemically synthesized. Both mutations disrupt the alpha-helical properties of the 8-16 region and lower its amyloidogenic potential, which was confirmed experimentally. Finally, cytotoxicity assays indicate that the 8-16 segment of hIAPP shows enhanced cytotoxicity, which is relieved by the L12R mutation but not by the L12P mutation. Our results indicate that the chameleon properties and the high aggregation propensity of the 8-16 region may significantly contribute to the formation of amyloid fibrils and the overall cytotoxic effect of hIAPP.",

    "abstract": "Glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in red blood cell (RBC) are modulated by the cell oxygenation state. This metabolic modulation is connected to variations in intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-reduced form (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels as a function of the oxygenation state of the cell, and, consequently, it should have physiologic relevance. In the present study, we analysed the effects of amyloid beta peptide (1-42) (Abeta) on RBC metabolism and its relationship with the activity of protein kinase C (PKC). Our results showed that metabolic response to Abeta depended on the degree of cell oxygenation. In particular, under high O2 pressure, in Abeta-treated RBC, glucose metabolized through PPP approached that metabolized by RBC under low O2 pressure, differently to that observed in untreated cells. The effect of Abeta on RBC metabolism was paralleled by increase in PKC enzyme activity, but cytosolic Ca2+ concentration does not seem to be involved in this mechanism. Incubation of Abeta-treated RBC with a specific inhibitor of PKC partially restores PPP flux. A possible rationalization of the different metabolic behaviours shown by RBC following Abeta treatment is proposed. It takes into account the known post-translational modifications to cytoskeleton proteins induced by PKC. The reduction in PPP flux may lead to a weakened defence system of antioxidant reserve in RBC, becoming a source of reactive species, and, consequently, its typical, structural and functional features are lost. Therefore, oxidative stress may outflow from the RBC and trigger damage events in adjacent cells and tissue, thus contributing to vascular damage.",

    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), neurodegenerative signals such as amyloid-beta (Abeta) and the precursors of neurotrophins, outbalance neurotrophic signals, causing synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. The neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR) is a receptor of Abeta and mediates Abeta-induced neurodegenerative signals. The shedding of its ectodomain from the cell surface is physiologically regulated; however, the function of the diffusible p75NTR ectodomain (p75ECD) after shedding remains largely not known. Here, we show that p75ECD levels in cerebrospinal fluid and in the brains of Alzheimer's patients and amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP)/PS1 transgenic mice were significantly reduced, due to inhibition of the sheddase-tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme by Abeta. Restoration of p75ECD to the normal level by brain delivery of the gene encoding human p75ECD before or after Abeta deposition in the brain of APP/PS1 mice reversed the behavioral deficits and AD-type pathologies, such as Abeta deposit, apoptotic events, neuroinflammation, Tau phosphorylation and loss of dendritic spine, neuronal structures and synaptic proteins. Furthermore, p75ECD can also reduce amyloidogenesis by suppressing beta-secretase expression and activities. Our data demonstrate that p75ECD is a physiologically neuroprotective molecule against Abeta toxicity and would be a novel therapeutic target and biomarker for AD.",

Neuropathological and genetic studies suggested that apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) protein facilitates deposition of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain, although the mechanism whereby apoE4 increases amyloid aggregates remains elusive. Here we show that injection of Abeta protofibrils induced Abeta deposition in the brain of APP transgenic mice, suggesting that Abeta protofibrils acted as a seed for aggregation and deposition of Abeta in vivo. Injection of Abeta protofibrils together with apoE3 significantly attenuated Abeta deposition, whereas apoE4 did not have this effect. In vitro assays revealed that the conversion of Abeta protofibrils to fibrils progressed more slowly upon coincubation with apoE2 or apoE3 compared with that with apoE4. Abeta protofibrils complexed with apoE4 were less stable than those with apoE2 or apoE3. These data suggest that the suppression effect of apoE2 or apoE3 on the structural conversion of Abeta protofibrils to fibrils is stronger than those of apoE4, thereby impeding beta-amyloid deposition.",

The basal forebrain, including the septal region, which regulates the excitability of the hippocampus and neocortex, is affected early in AD because its neurons are vulnerable to Abeta peptides. In addition, connections between lateral and medial septal regions (medial septum and diagonal band of Broca) have been demonstrated in previous studies. To demonstrate the involvement of excitotoxicity in Abeta-induced septal damage, we compared rats injected with Abeta1-40 into the lateral septal region structure with rats treated with memantine (a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist), before, during, and after Abeta1-40 injection. Medial septal cholinergic neurons were immunochemically identified and their numbers were estimated using Image J cell count. Our results show that Abeta1-40-treated animals have a significantly low number of medial septum and diagonal band of Broca cholinergic neurons compared with the Abeta/memantine-treated group.",

To investigate the relationship between APP metabolism and tau protein levels and phosphorylation, we studied human-stem-cell-derived forebrain neurons with genetic forms of AD, all of which increase the release of pathogenic Abeta peptides. We identified marked increases in intracellular tau in genetic forms of AD that either mutated APP or increased its dosage, suggesting that APP metabolism is coupled to changes in tau proteostasis. Manipulating APP metabolism by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase inhibition, as well as gamma-secretase modulation, results in specific increases and decreases in tau protein levels. These data demonstrate that APP metabolism regulates tau proteostasis and suggest that the relationship between APP processing and tau is not mediated solely through extracellular Abeta signaling to neurons.",

    "abstract": "Surface plasmon resonance was used to investigate the kinetics, affinity, and specificity of binding between anti-Abeta (beta-amyloid) IgG antibodies and oligomeric Abeta. Two factors were needed to accurately characterize the IgG binding kinetics. First, a bivalent model was necessary to properly fit the kinetic association and dissociation sensograms. Second, a high concentration of IgG was necessary to overcome a significant mass transport limitation that existed regardless of oligomer density on the sensor surface. Using high IgG concentrations and bivalent fits, consistent kinetic parameters were found at varying sensor surface ligand densities. A comparison of binding specificity, affinity, and kinetic flux between monoclonal and natural human anti-Abeta IgG antibodies revealed the following findings. First, monoclonal antibodies 6E10 and 4G8 single-site binding affinity is similar between Abeta oligomers and monomers. Second, natural human anti-Abeta IgG binding readily binds Abeta oligomers but does not bind monomers. Third, natural human anti-Abeta IgG binds Abeta oligomers with a higher affinity and kinetic flux than 6E10 and 4G8. Both the current analytical methodology and antibody binding profiles are important for advances in antibody drug development and kinetic biomarker applications for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Multitarget therapeutic leads for Alzheimer's disease were designed on the models of compounds capable of maintaining or restoring cell protein homeostasis and of inhibiting beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomerization. Thirty-seven thioxanthen-9-one, xanthen-9-one, naphto- and anthraquinone derivatives were tested for the direct inhibition of Abeta(1-40) aggregation and for the inhibition of electric eel acetylcholinesterase (eeAChE) and horse serum butyrylcholinesterase (hsBChE). These compounds are characterized by basic side chains, mainly quinolizidinylalkyl moieties, linked to various bi- and tri-cyclic (hetero)aromatic systems. With very few exceptions, these compounds displayed inhibitory activity on both AChE and BChE and on the spontaneous aggregation of beta-amyloid. In most cases, IC50 values were in the low micromolar and sub-micromolar range, but some compounds even reached nanomolar potency. The time course of amyloid aggregation in the presence of the most active derivative (IC50 =0.84 muM) revealed that these compounds might act as destabilizers of mature fibrils rather than mere inhibitors of fibrillization. Many compounds inhibited one or both cholinesterases and Abeta aggregation with similar potency, a fundamental requisite for the possible development of therapeutics exhibiting a multitarget mechanism of action. The described compounds thus represent interesting leads for the development of multitarget AD therapeutics.",

    "title": "Association between Oxidative Stress and Frailty in an Elderly German Population: Results from the ESTHER Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress (OS) and inflammatory biomarkers have been postulated to be important factors in the development of age-related diseases. While causes of frailty are complex and multidimensional based on the interaction of genetic, biological, physical, and environmental factors, the biological basis of frailty has been difficult to establish. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to assess the possible association between different OS and inflammatory biomarkers and frailty. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis was performed among 2,518 subjects participating in a large population-based cohort study on aging conducted in Germany. Frailty was assessed as proposed by Fried et al. [J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci 2001;56:M146-M156]. OS biomarkers, biological antioxidant potential (BAP), derivate of reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROM) and total thiol levels (TTL), and an established biomarker of inflammation C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured by spectrophotometry and immunoturbidimetry. Logistic regression models were performed to assess the relationship between the OS biomarkers and frailty status. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to quantify the associations. RESULTS: Mean levels of d-ROM, TTL, and CRP differed between frail and non-frail participants (p values <0.0001). Comparing highest and lowest quartiles of the biomarkers, statistically significant positive associations with frailty were observed for d-ROM (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.25-3.25) and CRP (OR: 3.15, 95% CI: 2.00-4.96), respectively, after controlling for age and sex. An inverse statistically significant association with frailty was observed for TTL (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.25-0.69). CONCLUSION: The strong associations with OS biomarkers and CRP support a major role of OS and inflammation in the development of frailty, which should be followed up in further longitudinal studies on frailty.",

    "abstract": "Several data indicate that neuronal infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) causes biochemical alterations reminiscent of Alzheimer's disease (AD) phenotype. They include accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta), which originates from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, which leads to neurofibrillary tangle deposition. HSV-1 infection triggers APP processing and drives the production of several fragments including APP intracellular domain (AICD) that exerts transactivating properties. Herein, we analyzed the production and intracellular localization of AICD following HSV-1 infection in neurons. We also checked whether AICD induced the transcription of two target genes, neprilysin (nep) and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (gsk3beta), whose products play a role in Abeta clearance and tau phosphorylation, respectively. Our data indicate that HSV-1 led to the accumulation and nuclear translocation of AICD in neurons. Moreover, results from chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that AICD binds the promoter region of both nep and gsk3beta. Time course analysis of NEP and GSK3beta expression at both mRNA and protein levels demonstrated that they are differently modulated during infection. NEP expression and enzymatic activity were initially stimulated but, with the progression of infection, they were down-regulated. In contrast, GSK3beta expression remained nearly unchanged, but the analysis of its phosphorylation suggests that it was inactivated only at later stages of HSV-1 infection. Thus, our data demonstrate that HSV-1 infection induces early upstream events in the cell that may eventually lead to Abeta deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation and further suggest HSV-1 as a possible risk factor for AD.",

    "abstract": "Multiple small-molecule inhibitors of the beta-secretase enzyme (BACE1) are under preclinical or clinical investigation for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prior work has illustrated robust lowering of central amyloid beta (Abeta) after acute administration of BACE1 inhibitors. However, very few studies have assessed the overall impact of chronically administered BACE1 inhibitors on brain amyloid burden, neuropathology, and behavioral function in aged preclinical models. We investigated the effects of a potent nonbrain-penetrant BACE1 inhibitor, delivered directly to the brain using intracerebroventricular infusion in an aged transgenic mouse model. Intracerebroventricular infusion of the BACE1 inhibitor (0.3-23.5 mug/d) for 8 weeks, initiated in 17-month-old Tg2576 mice, produced dose-dependent increases in brain inhibitor concentrations (0.2-13 mum). BACE1 inhibition significantly reversed the behavioral deficit in contextual fear conditioning, and reduced brain Abeta levels, plaque burden, and associated pathology (e.g., dystrophic neurites), with maximal effects attained with ~1 mug/d dose. Strikingly, the BACE1 inhibitor also reversed amyloid pathology below baseline levels (amyloid burden at the start of treatment), without adversely affecting cerebral amyloid angiopathy, microhemorrhages, myelination, or neuromuscular function. Inhibitor-mediated decline in brain amyloid pathology was associated with an increase in microglial ramification. This is the first demonstration of chronically administered BACE1 inhibitor to activate microglia, reverse brain amyloid pathology, and elicit functional improvement in an aged transgenic mouse model. Thus, engagement of novel glial-mediated clearance mechanisms may drive disease-modifying therapeutic benefit with BACE1 inhibition in AD.",

The copolymer was found to efficiently inhibit the aggregation and fibrillation of Abeta42 by using fluorescence assay and atomic force microscopy. Reduced beta-sheet formation of Abeta42 peptide after addition of copolymer was observed by circular dichroism. Furthermore, the cell viability assay confirmed that the toxicity of Abeta42 for SH-SY5Y cells was markedly reduced in the presence of copolymer.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced vascular dysfunction significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is known to impair endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, thus inhibiting endothelial nitric oxide production (NO). METHOD: In this study, we investigated Abeta-effects on heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) interaction with eNOS and Akt in cultured vascular endothelial cells and also explored the role of oxidative stress in this process. RESULTS: Treatments of endothelial cells (EC) with Abeta promoted the constitutive association of HSP90 with eNOS but abrogated agonist (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF))-mediated HSP90 interaction with Akt. This effect resulted in blockade of agonist-mediated phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS at serine 1179. Furthermore, Abeta stimulated the production of reactive oxygen species in endothelial cells and concomitant treatments of the cells with the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) prevented Abeta effects in promoting HSP90/eNOS interaction and rescued agonist-mediated Akt and eNOS phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained data support the hypothesis that oxidative damage caused by Abeta results in altered interaction of HSP90 with Akt and eNOS, therefore promoting vascular dysfunction. This mechanism, by contributing to Abeta-mediated blockade of nitric oxide production, may significantly contribute to the cognitive impairment seen in AD patients.",

    "abstract": "Proteasome inhibitors have a 20 year history in cancer therapy. The first proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib (Velcade, PS-341), a break-through multiple myeloma treatment, moved rapidly through development from bench in 1994 to first approval in 2003. Bortezomib is a reversible boronic acid inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome. Next generation proteasome inhibitors include carfilzomib and oprozomib which are irreversible epoxyketone proteasome inhibitors; and ixazomib and delanzomib which are reversible boronic acid proteasome inhibitors. Two proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib and carfilzomib are FDA approved drugs and ixazomib and oprozomib are in late stage clinical trials. All of the agents are potent cytotoxics. The disease focus for all the proteasome inhibitors is multiple myeloma. This focus arose from clinical observations made in bortezomib early clinical trials. Later preclinical studies confirmed that multiple myeloma cells were indeed more sensitive to proteasome inhibitors than other tumor cell types. The discovery and development of the proteasome inhibitor class of anticancer agents has progressed through a classic route of serendipity and scientific investigation. These agents are continuing to have a major impact in their treatment of hematologic malignancies and are beginning to be explored as potential treatment agent for non-cancer indications.",

Here we comprehensively assessed TREM2 rs75932628 for association with these diseases in a total of 19,940 previously untyped subjects of European descent. These data were combined with those from 28 published data sets by meta-analysis. Furthermore, we tested whether rs75932628 shows association with amyloid beta (Abeta42) and total-tau protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 828 individuals with AD or mild cognitive impairment. Our data show that rs75932628 is highly significantly associated with the risk of AD across 24,086 AD cases and 148,993 controls of European descent (odds ratio or OR = 2.71, P = 4.67 x 10(-25)). No consistent evidence for association was found between this marker and the risk of FTLD (OR = 2.24, P = .0113 across 2673 cases/9283 controls), PD (OR = 1.36, P = .0767 across 8311 cases/79,938 controls) and ALS (OR = 1.41, P = .198 across 5544 cases/7072 controls). Furthermore, carriers of the rs75932628 risk allele showed significantly increased levels of CSF-total-tau (P = .0110) but not Abeta42 suggesting that TREM2's role in AD may involve tau dysfunction.",

    "title": "On the identification of low allele frequency mosaic mutations in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The cause of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. Given the growing evidence that protein aggregates can spread in a \"prion-like\" fashion, we reasoned that a small population of brain cells producing such \"prion-like\" particles due to a postzygotic acquired mutation would be sufficient to trigger the disease. Deep DNA sequencing technology should in principle allow the detection of such mosaics. METHODS: To detect the somatic mutations of genes causing AD present in a small number of cells, we developed a targeted deep sequencing approach to scrutinize the genomic loci of APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes in DNA extracted from the entorhinal cortex, one of the brain regions showing the earliest signs of AD pathology. We also included the analysis of the MAPT gene because mutations may promote tangle formation. We validated candidate mutations with an independent targeted ultradeep amplicon sequencing technique. RESULTS: We demonstrate that our approach can detect single-nucleotide mosaic variants with a 1% allele frequency and copy number mosaic variants present in as few as 10% of cells. We screened 72 AD and 58 control brain samples and identified three mosaic variants with low allelic frequency (~1%): two novel MAPT variants in sporadic AD patients and a known PSEN2 variant in a Braak II control subject. Moreover, we detected both novel and known pathogenic nonmosaic heterozygous variants in PSEN1 and PSEN2 in this cohort of sporadic AD patients. DISCUSSION: Our results show that mosaic mutations with low allelic frequencies in AD-relevant genes can be detected in brain-derived DNA, but larger samples need to be investigated before a more definitive conclusion with regard to the pathogenicity of such mosaics can be made.",

To address this issue, we adopted optogenetics and transduced stabilized step-function opsin, a channelrhodopsin engineered to elicit a long-lasting neuronal hyperexcitability, into the hippocampal perforant pathway of APP transgenic mice. In vivo microdialysis revealed a ~24% increase in the hippocampal interstitial fluid Abeta42 levels immediately after acute light activation. Five months of chronic optogenetic stimulation increased Abeta burden specifically in the projection area of the perforant pathway (i.e., outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus) of the stimulated side by ~2.5-fold compared with that in the contralateral side. Epileptic seizures were observed during the course of chronic stimulation, which might have partly contributed to the Abeta pathology.

    "abstract": "The 16p11.2 600 kb copy-number variants (CNVs) are associated with mirror phenotypes on BMI, head circumference, and brain volume and represent frequent genetic lesions in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia. Here we interrogated the transcriptome of individuals carrying reciprocal 16p11.2 CNVs. Transcript perturbations correlated with clinical endophenotypes and were enriched for genes associated with ASDs, abnormalities of head size, and ciliopathies. Ciliary gene expression was also perturbed in orthologous mouse models, raising the possibility that ciliary dysfunction contributes to 16p11.2 pathologies. In support of this hypothesis, we found structural ciliary defects in the CA1 hippocampal region of 16p11.2 duplication mice. Moreover, by using an established zebrafish model, we show genetic interaction between KCTD13, a key driver of the mirrored neuroanatomical phenotypes of the 16p11.2 CNV, and ciliopathy-associated genes. Overexpression of BBS7 rescues head size and neuroanatomical defects of kctd13 morphants, whereas suppression or overexpression of CEP290 rescues phenotypes induced by KCTD13 under- or overexpression, respectively. Our data suggest that dysregulation of ciliopathy genes contributes to the clinical phenotypes of these CNVs.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are linked to cytotoxic diffusible aggregates of amyloid proteins, which are metastable intermediate species in protein misfolding. This study presents the first site-specific structural study on an intermediate called amylospheroid (ASPD), an AD-derived neurotoxin composed of oligomeric amyloid-beta (Abeta). Electron microscopy and immunological analyses using ASPD-specific \"conformational\" antibodies established synthetic ASPD for the 42-residue Abeta(1-42) as an excellent structural/morphological analogue of native ASPD extracted from AD patients, the level of which correlates with the severity of AD. (13)C solid-state NMR analyses of approximately 20 residues and interstrand distances demonstrated that the synthetic ASPD is made of a homogeneous single conformer containing parallel beta-sheets. These results provide profound insight into the native ASPD, indicating that Abeta is likely to self-assemble into the toxic intermediate with beta-sheet structures in AD brains. This approach can be applied to various intermediates relevant to amyloid diseases.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence has suggested that formation and propagation of misfolded aggregates of 42-residue human amyloid beta (Abeta(1-42)), rather than of the more abundant Abeta(1-40), provokes the Alzheimer's disease cascade. However, structural details of misfolded Abeta(1-42) have remained elusive. Here we present the atomic model of an Abeta(1-42) amyloid fibril, from solid-state NMR (ssNMR) data. It displays triple parallel-beta-sheet segments that differ from reported structures of Abeta(1-40) fibrils. Remarkably, Abeta(1-40) is incompatible with the triple-beta-motif, because seeding with Abeta(1-42) fibrils does not promote conversion of monomeric Abeta(1-40) into fibrils via cross-replication. ssNMR experiments suggest that C-terminal Ala42, absent in Abeta(1-40), forms a salt bridge with Lys28 to create a self-recognition molecular switch that excludes Abeta(1-40). The results provide insight into the Abeta(1-42)-selective self-replicating amyloid-propagation machinery in early-stage Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies show that patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and individuals with a diabetes-independent elevation in blood glucose have an increased risk for developing dementia, specifically dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). These observations suggest that abnormal glucose metabolism likely plays a role in some aspects of AD pathogenesis, leading us to investigate the link between aberrant glucose metabolism, T2DM, and AD in murine models. Here, we combined two techniques - glucose clamps and in vivo microdialysis - as a means to dynamically modulate blood glucose levels in awake, freely moving mice while measuring real-time changes in amyloid-beta (Abeta), glucose, and lactate within the hippocampal interstitial fluid (ISF). In a murine model of AD, induction of acute hyperglycemia in young animals increased ISF Abeta production and ISF lactate, which serves as a marker of neuronal activity. These effects were exacerbated in aged AD mice with marked Abeta plaque pathology. Inward rectifying, ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels mediated the response to elevated glucose levels, as pharmacological manipulation of K(ATP) channels in the hippocampus altered both ISF Abeta levels and neuronal activity. Taken together, these results suggest that K(ATP) channel activation mediates the response of hippocampal neurons to hyperglycemia by coupling metabolism with neuronal activity and ISF Abeta levels.",

Since insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) receptors facilitate the delivery of nascent lysosomal enzymes from the trans-Golgi network to endosomes, we evaluated their role in APP metabolism and cell viability using mouse fibroblast MS cells deficient in the murine IGF-II receptor and corresponding MS9II cells overexpressing the human IGF-II receptors. Our results show that IGF-II receptor overexpression increases the protein levels of APP. This is accompanied by an increase of beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 levels and an increase of beta- and gamma-secretase enzyme activities, leading to enhanced Abeta production. At the cellular level, IGF-II receptor overexpression causes localization of APP in perinuclear tubular structures, an increase of lipid raft components, and increased lipid raft partitioning of APP. Finally, MS9II cells are more susceptible to staurosporine-induced cytotoxicity, which can be attenuated by beta-secretase inhibitor. Together, these results highlight the potential contribution of IGF-II receptor to AD pathology not only by regulating expression/processing of APP but also by its role in cellular vulnerability.",

In doing so, it places soluble amyloid beta (Abeta), a protein hitherto considered as a primary initiator of AD, in a novel perspective. We note here that increased soluble Abeta is one of the proinflammatory cytokine-induced DAMPs recognized by at least one of the toll-like receptors on and in various cell types. Moreover, Abeta is best regarded as belonging to a class of DAMPs, as do the S100 proteins and HMBG1, that further exacerbate production of these same proinflammatory cytokines, which are already enhanced, and induces them further. Moreover, variation in levels of other DAMPs of this same class in AD may explain why normal elderly patients can exhibit high Abeta plaque levels, and why removing Abeta or its plaque does not retard disease progression. It may also explain why mouse transgenic models, having been designed to generate high Abeta, can be treated successfully by this approach.",

Although different families of intramembrane proteases have been discovered and characterized, we currently do not know how these enzymes discriminate between substrates and non-substrates, how site-specific cleavage is achieved, or which factors determine the rate of proteolysis. Focusing on gamma-secretase and rhomboid proteases, we argue that answers to these questions may emerge from connecting experimental readouts, such as reaction kinetics and the determination of cleavage sites, to the structures and the conformational dynamics of substrates and enzymes.",

    "title": "TrkB reduction exacerbates Alzheimer's disease-like signaling aberrations and memory deficits without affecting beta-amyloidosis in 5XFAD mice.",
    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence shows that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) significantly decrease early in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains unclear whether BDNF/TrkB reductions may be mechanistically involved in the pathogenesis of AD. To address this question, we generated 5XFAD transgenic mice with heterozygous TrkB knockout (TrkB(+/-) 5XFAD), and tested the effects of TrkB reduction on AD-like features in this mouse model during an incipient stage that shows only modest amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology and retains normal mnemonic function. TrkB(+/-) reduction exacerbated memory declines in 5XFAD mice at 4-5 months of age as assessed by the hippocampus-dependent spontaneous alternation Y-maze task, while the memory performance was not affected in TrkB(+/-) mice. Meanwhile, TrkB(+/-) 5XFAD mice were normal in nest building, a widely used measure for social behavior, suggesting the memory-specific aggravation of AD-associated behavioral impairments. We found no difference between TrkB(+/-) 5XFAD and 5XFAD control mice in cerebral plaque loads, Abeta concentrations including total Abeta42 and soluble oligomers and beta-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein. Interestingly, reductions in hippocampal expression of AMPA/NMDA glutamate receptor subunits as well as impaired signaling pathways downstream to TrkB such as CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) and Akt/GSK-3beta (glycogen synthase kinase-3beta) were observed in TrkB(+/-) 5XFAD mice but not in 5XFAD mice. Among these signaling aberrations, only Akt/GSK-3beta dysfunction occurred in TrkB(+/-) mice, while others were synergistic consequences between TrkB reduction and subthreshold levels of Abeta in TrkB(+/-) 5XFAD mice. Collectively, our results indicate that reduced TrkB does not affect beta-amyloidosis but exacerbates the manifestation of hippocampal mnemonic and signaling dysfunctions in early AD.",

    "title": "Modeling clustered activity increase in amyloid-beta positron emission tomographic images with statistical descriptors.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) holds promise for detecting the presence of Abeta plaques in the cortical gray matter. Many image analyses focus on regional average measurements of tracer activity distribution; however, considerable additional information is available in the images. Metrics that describe the statistical properties of images, such as the two-point correlation function (S2), have found wide applications in astronomy and materials science. S2 provides a detailed characterization of spatial patterns in images typically referred to as clustering or flocculence. The objective of this study was to translate the two-point correlation method into Abeta-PET of the human brain using 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (11C-PiB) to characterize longitudinal changes in the tracer distribution that may reflect changes in Abeta plaque accumulation. METHODS: We modified the conventional S2 metric, which is primarily used for binary images and formulated a weighted two-point correlation function (wS2) to describe nonbinary, real-valued PET images with a single statistical function. Using serial 11C-PiB scans, we calculated wS2 functions from two-dimensional PET images of different cortical regions as well as three-dimensional data from the whole brain. The area under the wS2 functions was calculated and compared with the mean/median of the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). For three-dimensional data, we compared the area under the wS2 curves with the subjects' cerebrospinal fluid measures. RESULTS: Overall, the longitudinal changes in wS2 correlated with the increase in mean SUVR but showed lower variance. The whole brain results showed a higher inverse correlation between the cerebrospinal Abeta and wS2 than between the cerebrospinal Abeta and SUVR mean/median. We did not observe any confounding of wS2 by region size or injected dose. CONCLUSION: The wS2 detects subtle changes and provides additional information about the binding characteristics of radiotracers and Abeta accumulation that are difficult to verify with mean SUVR alone.",

    "abstract": "PMC-12 is a prescription used in traditional Korean medicine that consists of a mixture of four herbal medicines, Polygonum multiflorum, Rehmannia glutinosa, Polygala tenuifolia, and Acorus gramineus, which have been reported to have various pharmacological effects on age-related neurological diseases. In the present study, we investigated whether PMC-12 improves cognitive deficits associated with decreased neuroinflammation in an amyloid-beta-(Abeta-) induced mouse model and exerts the antineuroinflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide-(LPS-) stimulated murine BV2 microglia. Intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta 25-35 in mice resulted in impairment in learning and spatial memory, whereas this was reversed by oral administration of PMC-12 (100 and 500 mg/kg/day) in dose-dependent manners. Moreover, PMC-12 reduced the increase of Abeta expression and activation of microglia and astrocytes in the Abeta 25-35-injected brain. Furthermore, quantitative PCR data showed that inflammatory mediators were significantly decreased by administration of PMC-12 in Abeta-injected brains. Consistent with the in vivo data, PMC-12 significantly reduced the inflammatory mediators in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells without cell toxicity. Moreover, PMC-12 exhibited anti-inflammatory properties via downregulation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK pathways. These findings suggest that the protective effects of PMC-12 may be mediated by its antineuroinflammatory activities, resulting in the attenuation of memory impairment; accordingly, PMC-12 may be useful in the prevention and treatment of AD.",

    "title": "Regulation of copper and iron homeostasis by metal chelators: a possible chemotherapy for Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "With the increase of life expectancy of humans in more than two-thirds of the countries in the World, aging diseases are becoming the frontline health problems. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now one of the major challenges in drug discovery, since, with the exception of memantine in 2003, all clinical trials with drug candidates failed over the past decade. If we consider that the loss of neurons is due to a high level of oxidative stress produced by nonregulated redox active metal ions like copper linked to amyloids of different sizes, regulation of metal homeostasis is a key target. The difficulty for large copper-carrier proteins to directly extract copper ions from metalated amyloids might be considered as being at the origin of the rupture of the copper homeostasis regulation in AD brains. So, there is an urgent need for new specific metal chelators that should be able to regulate the homeostasis of metal ions, specially copper and iron, in AD brains. As a consequence of that concept, chelators promoting metal excretion from brain are not desired. One should favor ligands able to extract copper ions from sinks (amyloids being the major one) and to transfer these redox-active metal ions to copper-carrier proteins or copper-containing enzymes. Obviously, the affinity of these chelators for the metal ion should not be a sufficient criterion, but the metal specificity and the ability of the chelators to release the metal under specific biological conditions should be considered. Such an approach is still largely unexplored. The requirements for the chelators are very high (ability to cross the brain-blood barrier, lack of toxicity, etc.), few chemical series were proposed, and, among them, biochemical or biological data are scarce. As a matter of fact, the bioinorganic pharmacology of AD represents less than 1% of all articles dedicated to AD drug research. The major part of these articles deals with an old and rather toxic drug, clioquinol and related analogs, that do not efficiently extract copper from soluble amyloids. We have designed and developed new tetradendate ligands such as 21 and PA1637 based on bis(8-aminoquinolines) that are specific for copper chelation and are able to extract copper(II) from amyloids and then can release copper ion upon reduction with a biological reducing agent. These studies contribute to the understanding of the physicochemical properties of the tetradentate copper ligands compared with bidentate ligands like clioquinol. One of these copper ligands, PA1637, after selection with a nontransgenic mouse model that is able to efficiently monitor the loss of episodic memory, is currently under preclinical development.",

Detailed molecular structural models for certain fibrils and aggregation intermediates are now available. It is now well established that amyloid fibrils are generally polymorphic at the molecular level, with a given peptide or protein being capable of forming a variety of distinct, self-propagating fibril structures. Recent results from structural studies and from studies involving cell cultures, transgenic animals, and human tissue provide initial evidence that molecular structural variations in amyloid fibrils and related aggregates may correlate with or even produce variations in disease development.

    "title": "Cognitive and functional patterns of nondemented subjects with equivocal visual amyloid PET findings.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Despite good to excellent inter-reader agreement in the evaluation of amyloid load on PET scans in subjects with Alzheimer's disease, some equivocal findings have been reported in the literature. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of subjects with equivocal PET images. METHODS: Nondemented subjects aged 70 years or more were enrolled from the MAPT trial. Cognitive and functional assessments were conducted at baseline, at 6 months, and annually for 3 years. During the follow-up period, 271 subjects had (18)F-AV45 PET scans. Images were visually assessed by three observers and classified as positive, negative or equivocal (if one observer disagreed). After debate, equivocal images were reclassified as positive (EP+) or negative (EP-). Scans were also classified by semiautomated quantitative analysis using mean amyloid uptake of cortical regions. We evaluated agreement among the observers, and between visual and quantitative assessments using kappa coefficients, and compared the clinical characteristics of the subjects according to their PET results. RESULTS: In 158 subjects (58.30 %) the PET scan was negative for amyloid, in 77 (28.41 %) the scan was positive and in 36 (13.28 %) the scan was equivocal. Agreement among the three observers was excellent (kappa 0.80). Subjects with equivocal images were more frequently men (58 % vs. 37 %) and exhibited intermediate scores on cognitive and functional scales between those of subjects with positive and negative scans. Amyloid load differed between the EP- and negative groups and between the EP+ and positive groups after reclassification. CONCLUSION: Equivocal amyloid PET images could represent a neuroimaging entity with intermediate amyloid load but without a specific neuropsychological pattern. Clinical follow-up to assess cognitive evolution in subjects with equivocal scans is needed.",

    "abstract": "The human body balance system is a complex system of organs and mechanisms, which generate postural reactions to counter the displacement from the equilibrium position of the body centre of gravity, and which control eye movement in order to maintain a stable image of the environment. Computerised Dynamic Posturography (CDP) allows for a quantitative and objective assessment of the sen- sory and motor components of the body balance control system as well as of the integration and adaptive mechanisms in the central nervous system. The aim of this study was to determine the differences, when maintaining body balance, based on the gender of young, healthy people using CDP. The study was carried out on a group of 43 healthy subjects by comparing the effectiveness of the balance system in 22 women and 21 men aged between 20 and 26 years, between 171 and 177 cm in height, and without any clinical symptoms of balance disorders. The men and women were selected such that they did not differ significantly in height and BMI. Using the Equitest posturograph manufactured by NeuroCom International Inc. the following tests were performed: Sensory Organisation Test (SOT), Motor Control Test (MCT) and the Adaptation Test (ADT). The gender of young healthy individuals without any clinical symptoms of balance disorders also does not affect the effectiveness of the sensory system and the use of this signal in maintaining body balance.",

    "title": "Existing Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography thresholds are too high: statistical and pathological evaluation.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, begins accumulating up to two decades before the onset of dementia, and can be detected in vivo applying amyloid-beta positron emission tomography tracers such as carbon-11-labelled Pittsburgh compound-B. A variety of thresholds have been applied in the literature to define Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography positivity, but the ability of these thresholds to detect early amyloid-beta deposition is unknown, and validation studies comparing Pittsburgh compound-B thresholds to post-mortem amyloid burden are lacking. In this study we first derived thresholds for amyloid positron emission tomography positivity using Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography in 154 cognitively normal older adults with four complementary approaches: (i) reference values from a young control group aged between 20 and 30 years; (ii) a Gaussian mixture model that assigned each subject a probability of being amyloid-beta-positive or amyloid-beta-negative based on Pittsburgh compound-B index uptake; (iii) a k-means cluster approach that clustered subjects into amyloid-beta-positive or amyloid-beta-negative based on Pittsburgh compound-B uptake in different brain regions (features); and (iv) an iterative voxel-based analysis that further explored the spatial pattern of early amyloid-beta positron emission tomography signal. Next, we tested the sensitivity and specificity of the derived thresholds in 50 individuals who underwent Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography during life and brain autopsy (mean time positron emission tomography to autopsy 3.1 +- 1.8 years). Amyloid at autopsy was classified using Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) criteria, unadjusted for age. The analytic approaches yielded low thresholds (standard uptake value ratiolow = 1.21, distribution volume ratiolow = 1.08) that represent the earliest detectable Pittsburgh compound-B signal, as well as high thresholds (standard uptake value ratiohigh = 1.40, distribution volume ratiohigh = 1.20) that are more conservative in defining Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography positivity. In voxel-wise contrasts, elevated Pittsburgh compound-B retention was first noted in the medial frontal cortex, then the precuneus, lateral frontal and parietal lobes, and finally the lateral temporal lobe. When compared to post-mortem amyloid burden, low proposed thresholds were more sensitive than high thresholds (sensitivities: distribution volume ratiolow 81.0%, standard uptake value ratiolow 83.3%; distribution volume ratiohigh 61.9%, standard uptake value ratiohigh 62.5%) for CERAD moderate-to-frequent neuritic plaques, with similar specificity (distribution volume ratiolow 95.8%; standard uptake value ratiolow, distribution volume ratiohigh and standard uptake value ratiohigh 100.0%). A receiver operator characteristic analysis identified optimal distribution volume ratio (1.06) and standard uptake value ratio (1.20) thresholds that were nearly identical to the a priori distribution volume ratiolow and standard uptake value ratiolow. In summary, we found that frequently applied thresholds for Pittsburgh compound-B positivity (typically at or above distribution volume ratiohigh and standard uptake value ratiohigh) are overly stringent in defining amyloid positivity. Lower thresholds in this study resulted in higher sensitivity while not compromising specificity.",

    "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has a crucial role in learning and memory by promoting neuronal survival and modulating synaptic connectivity. BDNF levels are lower in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting a pathogenic involvement. The Drosophila orthologue of BDNF is the highly conserved Neurotrophin 1 (DNT1). BDNF and DNT1 have the same overall protein structure and can be cleaved, resulting in the conversion of a full-length polypeptide into separate pro- and mature-domains. While the BDNF mature-domain is neuroprotective, the role of the pro-domain is less clear. In flies and mammalian cells, we have identified a synergistic toxic interaction between the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta1-42) and the pro-domains of both DNT1 and BDNF. Specifically, we show that DNT1 pro-domain acquires a neurotoxic activity in the presence of Abeta1-42. In contrast, DNT1 mature-domain is protective against Abeta1-42 toxicity. Likewise, in SH-SY5Y cell culture, BDNF pro-domain is toxic only in the presence of Abeta1-42. Western blots indicate that this synergistic interaction likely results from the Abeta1-42-induced upregulation of the BDNF pro-domain receptor p75(NTR). The clinical relevance of these findings is underlined by a greater than thirty fold increase in the ratio of BDNF pro- to mature-domains in the brains of individuals with AD. This unbalanced BDNF pro:mature-domain ratio in patients represents a possible biomarker of AD and may offer a target for therapeutic intervention.",

    "title": "The Familial British Dementia Mutation Promotes Formation of Neurotoxic Cystine Cross-linked Amyloid Bri (ABri) Oligomers.",
    "abstract": "Familial British dementia (FBD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease believed to result from a mutation in the BRI2 gene. Post-translational processing of wild type BRI2 and FBD-BRI2 result in the production of a 23-residue long Bri peptide and a 34-amino acid long ABri peptide, respectively, and ABri is found deposited in the brains of individuals with FBD. Similarities in the neuropathology and clinical presentation shared by FBD and Alzheimer disease (AD) have led some to suggest that ABri and the AD-associated amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) are molecular equivalents that trigger analogous pathogenic cascades. But the sequences and innate properties of ABri and Abeta are quite different, notably ABri contains two cysteine residues that can form disulfide bonds. Thus we sought to determine whether ABri was neurotoxic and if this activity was regulated by oxidation and/or aggregation. Crucially, the type of oxidative cross-linking dramatically influenced both ABri aggregation and toxicity. Cyclization of Bri and ABri resulted in production of biologically inert monomers that showed no propensity to assemble, whereas reduced ABri and reduced Bri aggregated forming thioflavin T-positive amyloid fibrils that lacked significant toxic activity. ABri was more prone to form inter-molecular disulfide bonds than Bri and the formation of covalently stabilized ABri oligomers was associated with toxicity. These results suggest that extension of the C-terminal of Bri causes a shift in the type of disulfide bonds formed and that structures built from covalently cross-linked oligomers can interact with neurons and compromise their function and viability.",

Our recent evidence suggests that chronic exposure to Abeta up-regulated neuronal alpha7-nAChRs and increased neuronal excitability in cultured hippocampal neurons.

In this study, we investigated the role of alpha7-nAChRs in the mediation of Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. The effects of Abeta exposure on alpha7-nAChRs and cytotoxicity were examined using whole-cell patch clamp recordings, atomic force microscope (AFM) imaging, immunoprecipitation, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay in primary cultured hippocampal neurons as well as differentiated human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells with cholinergic characteristics. We found that alpha7-nAChRs are necessary for Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in hippocampal neurons because chronic Abeta significantly increased LDH level in hippocampal cultures, which was prevented by either alpha7-nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA) or by alpha7 subunit gene deletion (cultures prepared from nAChR alpha7 subunit KO mice), whereas beta2-containing nAChR antagonist (dihydro-beta-erythroidine, DhbetaE) or the genetic deletion of nAChR beta2 subunit (cultures prepared from beta2 KO mice) failed to prevent Abeta-induced toxicity. In SH-SY5Y cells, larger aggregates of Abeta preferentially up-regulated alpha7-nAChR expression and function accompanied by a significant decrease in cell viability. Co-treatment MLA, but not mecamylamine (MEC), prevented Abeta exposure-induced neurotoxicity. Our results suggest a detrimental role of upregulated alpha7-nAChRs in the mediation of Abeta-induced neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study assessed apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 carrier status effects on Alzheimer's disease imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in cognitively normal older adults with significant memory concerns (SMC). METHODS: Cognitively normal, SMC, and early mild cognitive impairment participants from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were divided by APOE epsilon4 carrier status. Diagnostic and APOE effects were evaluated with emphasis on SMC. Additional analyses in SMC evaluated the effect of the interaction between APOE and [(18)F]Florbetapir amyloid positivity on CSF biomarkers. RESULTS: SMC epsilon4+ showed greater amyloid deposition than SMC epsilon4-, but no hypometabolism or medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy. SMC epsilon4+ showed lower amyloid beta 1-42 and higher tau/p-tau than epsilon4-, which was most abnormal in APOE epsilon4+ and cerebral amyloid positive SMC. DISCUSSION: SMC APOE epsilon4+ show abnormal changes in amyloid and tau biomarkers, but no hypometabolism or MTL neurodegeneration, reflecting the at-risk nature of the SMC group and the importance of APOE in mediating this risk.",

    "abstract": "Humic acid (HA) is a possible etiological factor associated with for several vascular diseases. It is known that vascular risk factors can directly increase the susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is a neurodegenerative disorder due to accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide in the brain. However, the role that HA contributes to Abeta-induced cytotoxicity has not been demonstrated. In the present study, we demonstrate that HA exhibits a synergistic effect enhancing Abeta-induced cytotoxicity in cultured human SK-N-MC neuronal cells. Furthermore, this deterioration was mediated through the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by stimulating PERK and eIF2alpha phosphorylation. We also observed HA and Abeta-induced cytotoxicity is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction caused by down-regulation of the Sirt1/PGC1alpha pathway, while in contrast, treating the cells with the ER stress inhibitor Salubrinal, or over-expression of Sirt1 significantly reduced loss of cell viability by HA and Abeta. Our findings suggest a new mechanism by which HA can deteriorate Abeta-induced cytotoxicity through modulation of ER stress, which may provide significant insights into the pathogenesis of AD co-occurring with vascular injury.",

Genetic ablation of tau prevents neuronal overexcitation and axonal transport deficits caused by recombinant Abeta oligomers. Relevance of these findings to naturally secreted Abeta and mechanisms underlying tau's enabling effect are unknown. Here we demonstrate deficits in anterograde axonal transport of mitochondria in primary neurons from transgenic mice expressing familial AD-linked forms of human amyloid precursor protein. We show that these deficits depend on Abeta1-42 production and are prevented by tau reduction. The copathogenic effect of tau did not depend on its microtubule binding, interactions with Fyn, or potential role in neuronal development. Inhibition of neuronal activity, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor function, or glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) activity or expression also abolished Abeta-induced transport deficits. Tau ablation prevented Abeta-induced GSK3beta activation. Thus, tau allows Abeta oligomers to inhibit axonal transport through activation of GSK3beta, possibly by facilitating aberrant neuronal activity.",

    "abstract": "The biological underpinnings linking stress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk are poorly understood. We investigated how corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), a critical stress response mediator, influences amyloid-beta (Abeta) production. In cells, CRF treatment increases Abeta production and triggers CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) and gamma-secretase internalization. Co-immunoprecipitation studies establish that gamma-secretase associates with CRFR1; this is mediated by beta-arrestin binding motifs. Additionally, CRFR1 and gamma-secretase co-localize in lipid raft fractions, with increased gamma-secretase accumulation upon CRF treatment. CRF treatment also increases gamma-secretase activity in vitro, revealing a second, receptor-independent mechanism of action. CRF is the first endogenous neuropeptide that can be shown to directly modulate gamma-secretase activity. Unexpectedly, CRFR1 antagonists also increased Abeta. These data collectively link CRF to increased Abeta through gamma-secretase and provide mechanistic insight into how stress may increase AD risk. They also suggest that direct targeting of CRF might be necessary to effectively modulate this pathway for therapeutic benefit in AD, as CRFR1 antagonists increase Abeta and in some cases preferentially increase Abeta42 via complex effects on gamma-secretase.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular deposition of insoluble amyloid fibrils resulting from the aggregation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a pathological feature of neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous small molecules have been reported to interfere with the process of Abeta aggregation. Compounds containing aromatic structures, hydrophobic amino acids and/or the alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) as beta-sheet breaker elements have been reported to be effective inhibitors of Abeta aggregation. We synthesized two peptides, one containing the Aib amino acid and the other including its trifluoromethylated analog (R)-alpha-Trifluoromethylalanine ((R)-Tfm-Alanine) and we evaluated the impact of these peptides on Abeta amyloid formation. The compounds were tested by standard methods such as thioflavin-T fluorescence spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy but also by circular dichroism, liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and NMR saturation transfer difference (STD) experiments to further characterize the effect of the two molecules on Abeta structure and on the kinetics of depletion of monomeric, soluble Abeta. Our results demonstrate that the peptide containing Aib reduces the quantity of aggregates containing beta-sheet structure but slightly inhibits Abeta fibril formation, while the molecule including the trifluoromethyl (Tfm) group slows down the kinetics of Abeta fibril formation, delays the random coil to beta-sheet structure transition and induces a change in the oligomerization pathway. These results suggest that the hydrophobic Tfm group has a better affinity with Abeta than the methyl groups of the Aib and that this Tfm group is effective and important in preventing the Abeta aggregation.",

    "title": "ApoE4 and Abeta Oligomers Reduce BDNF Expression via HDAC Nuclear Translocation.",
    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is a major genetic risk factor for several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epigenetic dysregulation, including aberrations in histone acetylation, is also associated with AD. We show here for the first time that ApoE4 increases nuclear translocation of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in human neurons, thereby reducing BDNF expression, whereas ApoE3 increases histone 3 acetylation and upregulates BDNF expression. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers, which have been implicated in AD, caused effects similar to ApoE4. Blocking low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) receptor with receptor-associated protein (RAP) or LRP-1 siRNA abolished the ApoE effects. ApoE3 also induced expression of protein kinase C epsilon (PKCepsilon) and PKCepsilon retained HDACs in the cytosol. PKCepsilon activation and ApoE3 supplementation prevented ApoE4-mediated BDNF downregulation. PKCepsilon activation also reversed Abeta oligomer- and ApoE4-induced nuclear import of HDACs, preventing the loss in BDNF. ApoE4 induced HDAC6-BDNF promoter IV binding, which reduced BDNF exon IV expression. Nuclear HDAC4 and HDAC6 were more abundant in the hippocampus of ApoE4 transgenic mice than in ApoE3 transgenic mice or wild-type controls. Nuclear translocation of HDA6 was also elevated in the hippocampus of AD patients compared with age-matched controls. These results provide new insight into the cause of synaptic loss that is the most important pathologic correlate of cognitive deficits in AD.",

    "abstract": "Solvation and hydration are key factors for determining the stability and folding of proteins, as well as the formation of amyloid fibrils and related polypeptide aggregates. Using attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared and solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we find that the Abeta peptide experiences a remarkable conformational switch from beta to alpha secondary structure upon solvent removal by lyophilization of oligomers. This transition is, contrary to Abeta fibrils, independent of concentration of organic co-solvents or co-solutes and is reversible upon re-addition of the solvent. Our data illuminate a previously unnoted secondary structural plasticity of the Abeta peptide in amyloid oligomers that could bear relevance for Abeta's interactions with cellular structures of low polarity.",

    "title": "Voxelwise Relationships Between Distribution Volume Ratio and Cerebral Blood Flow: Implications for Analysis of beta-Amyloid Images.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Quantification of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in vivo is often accomplished using the distribution volume ratio (DVR), based on a simplified reference tissue model. We investigated the local relationships between DVR and cerebral blood flow (CBF), as well as relative CBF (R1), in nondemented older adults. METHODS: Fifty-five nondemented participants (mean age, 78.5 y) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging underwent (15)O-H2O PET CBF and dynamic (11)C-PiB PET. (15)O-H2O PET images were normalized and smoothed using SPM. A simplified reference tissue model with linear regression and spatial constraints was used to generate parametric DVR images. The DVR images were regressed on CBF images on a voxel-by-voxel basis using robust biologic parametric mapping, adjusting for age and sex (false discovery rate, P = 0.05; spatial extent, 50 voxels). DVR images were also regressed on R1 images, a measure of the transport rate constant from vascular space to tissue. All analyses were performed on the entire sample, and on high and low tertiles of mean cortical DVR. RESULTS: Voxel-based analyses showed that increased DVR is associated with increased CBF in the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices. However, this association appears to spare regions that typically show early Abeta deposition. A more robust relationship between DVR and CBF was observed in the lower tertile of DVR, that is, negligible cortical Abeta load, compared with the upper tertile of cortical DVR and Abeta load. The spatial distributions of the DVR-CBF and DVR-R1 correlations showed similar patterns. No reliable negative voxelwise relationships between DVR and CBF or R1 were observed. CONCLUSION: Robust associations between DVR and CBF at negligible Abeta levels, together with similar spatial distributions of DVR-CBF and DVR-R1 correlations, suggest that regional distribution of DVR reflects blood flow and tracer influx rather than pattern of Abeta deposition in those with minimal Abeta load. DVR-CBF associations in individuals with a higher DVR are more likely to reflect true associations between patterns of Abeta deposition and CBF or neural activity. These findings have important implications for analysis and interpretation of voxelwise correlations with external variables in individuals with varying amounts of Abeta load.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral palsy is a sporadic disorder with multiple likely aetiologies, but frequently considered to be caused by birth asphyxia. Genetic investigations are rarely performed in patients with cerebral palsy and there is little proven evidence of genetic causes. As part of a large project investigating children with ataxia, we identified four patients in our cohort with a diagnosis of ataxic cerebral palsy. They were investigated using either targeted next generation sequencing or trio-based exome sequencing and were found to have mutations in three different genes, KCNC3, ITPR1 and SPTBN2. All the mutations were de novo and associated with increased paternal age. The mutations were shown to be pathogenic using a combination of bioinformatics analysis and in vitro model systems. This work is the first to report that the ataxic subtype of cerebral palsy can be caused by de novo dominant point mutations, which explains the sporadic nature of these cases. We conclude that at least some subtypes of cerebral palsy may be caused by de novo genetic mutations and patients with a clinical diagnosis of cerebral palsy should be genetically investigated before causation is ascribed to perinatal asphyxia or other aetiologies.",

    "title": "First effects of rising amyloid-beta in transgenic mouse brain: synaptic transmission and gene expression.",
    "abstract": "Detecting and treating Alzheimer's disease, before cognitive deficits occur, has become the health challenge of our time. The earliest known event in Alzheimer's disease is rising amyloid-beta. Previous studies have suggested that effects on synaptic transmission may precede plaque deposition. Here we report how relative levels of different soluble amyloid-beta peptides in hippocampus, preceding plaque deposition, relate to synaptic and genomic changes. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry was used to measure the early rise of different amyloid-beta peptides in a mouse model of increasing amyloid-beta ('TASTPM', transgenic for familial Alzheimer's disease genes APP/PSEN1). In the third postnatal week, several amyloid-beta peptides were above the limit of detection, including amyloid-beta40, amyloid-beta38 and amyloid-beta42 with an intensity ratio of 6:3:2, respectively. By 2 months amyloid-beta levels had only increased by 50% and although the ratio of the different peptides remained constant, the first changes in synaptic currents, compared to wild-type mice could be detected with patch-clamp recordings. Between 2 and 4 months old, levels of amyloid-beta40 rose by ~7-fold, but amyloid-beta42 rose by 25-fold, increasing the amyloid-beta42:amyloid-beta40 ratio to 1:1. Only at 4 months did plaque deposition become detectable and only in some mice; however, synaptic changes were evident in all hippocampal fields. These changes included increased glutamate release probability (P < 0.001, n = 7-9; consistent with the proposed physiological effect of amyloid-beta) and loss of spontaneous action potential-mediated activity in the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus (P < 0.001, n = 7). Hence synaptic changes occur when the amyloid-beta levels and amyloid-beta42:amyloid-beta40 ratio are still low compared to those necessary for plaque deposition. Genome-wide microarray analysis revealed changes in gene expression at 2-4 months including synaptic genes being strongly affected but often showing significant changes only by 4 months. We thus demonstrate that, in a mouse model of rising amyloid-beta, the initial deposition of plaques does not occur until several months after the first amyloid-beta becomes detectable but coincides with a rapid acceleration in the rise of amyloid-beta levels and the amyloid-beta42:amyloid-beta40 ratio. Prior to acceleration, however, there is already a pronounced synaptic dysfunction, reflected as changes in synaptic transmission and altered gene expression, indicating that restoring synaptic function early in the disease progression may represent the earliest possible target for intervention in the onset of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Influence of a hybrid form of cardiac rehabilitation on exercise tolerance in coronary artery disease patients with and without diabetes.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of stationary and ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes has been proven by some authors, but data concerning the effects of hybrid forms of cardiac rehabilitation (HCR) in this population are lacking. A home-based telerehabilitation is a promising form of secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in this group of patients. AIM: The objective of the study was to compare the effects of HCR in CAD patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). The secondary endpoint was the assessment of CAD risk factors like low exercise capacity and obesity, in both groups of patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective study, which comprised 125 patients with CAD aged 57.31 +- 5.61 years referred for HCR. They were assigned to Group D (with diabetes; n = 37) or Group C (without diabetes; n = 88). HCR was carried out as a comprehensive procedure that included all core components of cardiac rehabilitation according to guidelines. Before and after HCR all patients underwent a symptom-limited exercise test performed according to the Bruce protocol on a treadmill. RESULTS: Before HCR the maximal workload was higher in Group C than in Group D (8.13 +- 2.82 METs vs. 6.77 +- 1.88 METs; p = 0.023), but after HCR the difference was not significant. In both groups an increase in the maximal workload after HCR was observed (Group D: before HCR 6.81 +- 1.91 METs, after HCR 8.30 +- 2.04 METs; p < 0.001; Group C: before HCR 8.31 +- 2.71 METs, after HCR 9.13 +- 2.87 METs; p = 0.001). Resting heart rate, double product, and heart rate recovery 1 (HRR1) declined in both groups. No significant differences in changes in exercise test parameters between both groups' parameters were found. CONCLUSIONS: HCR was effective in patients with DM. The adherence was high. Patients with DM had higher rates of obesity and significantly lower exercise tolerance than patients without DM. Patients from both groups gained similar benefit from HCR in terms of physical capacity, resting heart rate, and heart rate recovery.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) binds to various neuronal receptors and elicits a context- and dose-dependent toxic or trophic response from neurons. The molecular mechanisms for this phenomenon are presently unknown. The cochaperone BAG2 has been shown to mediate important cellular responses to stress, including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Here, we use SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells to characterize BAG2 expression and regulation and investigate the involvement of BAG2 in Abeta1-42-mediated neurotrophism or neurotoxicity in the context of differentiation. We report that BAG2 is upregulated on differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells into neuron-like cells. This increase in BAG2 expression is accompanied by a change in response to treatment with Abeta1-42 from neurotrophic to neurotoxic. Further, overexpression of BAG2 in undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells was sufficient to induce the change from neurotrophic to neurotoxic response. Of several transcription factors queried, the putative BAG2 promoter had a higher-than-expected occurrence of response elements (RE) for nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB). Treatment with JSH-23, a potent inhibitor of NF-kappaB, caused a marked increase in BAG2 mRNA expression, suggesting that NF-kappaB is a repressor of BAG2 transcription in undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Together, these data suggest that NF-kappaB-mediated modulation of BAG2 expression constitutes a \"switch\" that regulates the shift between the neurotrophic and neurotoxic effects of Abeta1-42.",

DATA SOURCES: Relevant biomarker studies identified by searching studies published before April 2015 using the MEDLINE and Web of Science databases and through personal communication with investigators. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they provided individual participant data for participants without dementia and used an a priori defined cutoff for amyloid positivity. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Individual records were provided for 2914 participants with normal cognition, 697 with SCI, and 3972 with MCI aged 18 to 100 years from 55 studies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of amyloid pathology on positron emission tomography or in cerebrospinal fluid according to AD risk factors (age, apolipoprotein E [APOE] genotype, sex, and education) estimated by generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: The prevalence of amyloid pathology increased from age 50 to 90 years from 10% (95% CI, 8%-13%) to 44% (95% CI, 37%-51%) among participants with normal cognition; from 12% (95% CI, 8%-18%) to 43% (95% CI, 32%-55%) among patients with SCI; and from 27% (95% CI, 23%-32%) to 71% (95% CI, 66%-76%) among patients with MCI. APOE-epsilon4 carriers had 2 to 3 times higher prevalence estimates than noncarriers. The age at which 15% of the participants with normal cognition were amyloid positive was approximately 40 years for APOE epsilon4epsilon4 carriers, 50 years for epsilon2epsilon4 carriers, 55 years for epsilon3epsilon4 carriers, 65 years for epsilon3epsilon3 carriers, and 95 years for epsilon2epsilon3 carriers. Amyloid positivity was more common in highly educated participants but not associated with sex or biomarker modality. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among persons without dementia, the prevalence of cerebral amyloid pathology as determined by positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid findings was associated with age, APOE genotype, and presence of cognitive impairment. These findings suggest a 20- to 30-year interval between first development of amyloid positivity and onset of dementia.",

    "title": "Prevalence of amyloid PET positivity in dementia syndromes: a meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Amyloid-beta positron emission tomography (PET) imaging allows in vivo detection of fibrillar plaques, a core neuropathological feature of Alzheimer disease (AD). Its diagnostic utility is still unclear because amyloid plaques also occur in patients with non-AD dementia. OBJECTIVE: To use individual participant data meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of amyloid positivity on PET in a wide variety of dementia syndromes. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE and Web of Science databases were searched from January 2004 to April 2015 for amyloid PET studies. STUDY SELECTION: Case reports and studies on neurological or psychiatric diseases other than dementia were excluded. Corresponding authors of eligible cohorts were invited to provide individual participant data. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were provided for 1359 participants with clinically diagnosed AD and 538 participants with non-AD dementia. The reference groups were 1849 healthy control participants (based on amyloid PET) and an independent sample of 1369 AD participants (based on autopsy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Estimated prevalence of positive amyloid PET scans according to diagnosis, age, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 status, using the generalized estimating equations method. RESULTS: The likelihood of amyloid positivity was associated with age and APOE epsilon4 status. In AD dementia, the prevalence of amyloid positivity decreased from age 50 to 90 years in APOE epsilon4 noncarriers (86% [95% CI, 73%-94%] at 50 years to 68% [95% CI, 57%-77%] at 90 years; n = 377) and to a lesser degree in APOE epsilon4 carriers (97% [95% CI, 92%-99%] at 50 years to 90% [95% CI, 83%-94%] at 90 years; n = 593; P < .01). Similar associations of age and APOE epsilon4 with amyloid positivity were observed in participants with AD dementia at autopsy. In most non-AD dementias, amyloid positivity increased with both age (from 60 to 80 years) and APOE epsilon4 carriership (dementia with Lewy bodies: carriers [n = 16], 63% [95% CI, 48%-80%] at 60 years to 83% [95% CI, 67%-92%] at 80 years; noncarriers [n = 18], 29% [95% CI, 15%-50%] at 60 years to 54% [95% CI, 30%-77%] at 80 years; frontotemporal dementia: carriers [n = 48], 19% [95% CI, 12%-28%] at 60 years to 43% [95% CI, 35%-50%] at 80 years; noncarriers [n = 160], 5% [95% CI, 3%-8%] at 60 years to 14% [95% CI, 11%-18%] at 80 years; vascular dementia: carriers [n = 30], 25% [95% CI, 9%-52%] at 60 years to 64% [95% CI, 49%-77%] at 80 years; noncarriers [n = 77], 7% [95% CI, 3%-18%] at 60 years to 29% [95% CI, 17%-43%] at 80 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among participants with dementia, the prevalence of amyloid positivity was associated with clinical diagnosis, age, and APOE genotype. These findings indicate the potential clinical utility of amyloid imaging for differential diagnosis in early-onset dementia and to support the clinical diagnosis of participants with AD dementia and noncarrier APOE epsilon4 status who are older than 70 years.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of the cell membrane by the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides has been considered as a main mechanism of Alzheimer's disease. The peptide-to-lipid molar ratio (P:L) varies over a broad range biologically. We report here that two of the previously observed Abeta evolution pathways, fibrillation and induction of vesicle fusion, compete with each other when P:L varies in model Abeta-liposome systems. Fibrillation is preferred at higher P:L values, and fusion is promoted at lower P:L values. Structural studies suggest that the same residues in Abeta may involve in both the initial fibrillation and membrane binding at the fusion sites.",

In this work the effect of Cu(II) on the aggregation of Abeta is explored on a timescale from milliseconds to days, both at physiological pH and under mildly acidic conditions, by using stopped-flow kinetic measurements (fluorescence and light-scattering), (1) H NMR relaxation and ThT fluorescence. A minimal reaction model that relates the initial Cu(II) binding and Abeta folding with downstream aggregation is presented. We demonstrate that a highly aggregation prone Abeta Cu(II) species is formed on the sub-second timescale at mildly acidic pH. This observation might be central to the molecular origin of the known detrimental effect of acidosis in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by extracellular deposition of insoluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and intracellular tangles made up of phosphorylated tau in brain. Several therapeutic approaches are being carried out in animal AD models for testing their safety and efficacy in altering disease pathology and behavioral deficits. Very few studies have examined the effect of human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) derived stem cells in degenerative disease models despite growing number of cord blood banks worldwide. Here we have examined the therapeutic efficacy of hUCB derived lineage negative (Lin -ve) stem cells in alleviating behavioral and neuropathological deficits in a mouse model of cognitive impairment induced by bilateral intrahippocampal injection of Abeta-42. Lin -ve cells were transplanted at two doses (50,000 and 100,000) at the site of injury and examined at 10 and 60 days post transplantation for rescue of memory deficits. These cells were found to ameliorate cognitive impairment in 50,000-60 days and 100,000-10 days groups whereas, 50,000-10 days and 100,000-60 days groups could not exert any significant improvement. Further, mice showing spatial memory improvement were mediated by up-regulation of BDNF, CREB and also by concomitant down regulation of Fas-L in their brain. The transplanted cells were found in the host tissue and survived up to 60 days without expressing markers of neuronal differentiation or reducing Abeta burden in mouse brain. We suggest that these undifferentiated cells could exert neuroprotective effects either through inhibiting apoptosis and/or trophic effects in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Eriodictyol, a flavonoid isolated from the Chinese herb Dracocephalum rupestre, has long been established as an antioxidant. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of eriodictyol on beta-amyloid 25-35 peptide (Abeta25-35)-induced oxidative cell death in primary neurons and to explore the role of the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2/antioxidant response element (Nrf2/ARE) pathway in this process. For this purpose, primary cultures of cortical neurons were exposed to 15 muM Abeta25-35 in the absence or presence of eriodictyol (20, 40 and 80 muM). The results revealed that Abeta25-35-induced cytotoxicity and apoptotic characteristics such as activation of JNK/p38 apoptotic signaling pathway were effectively attenuated by eriodictyol pretreatment. Eriodictyol treatment also resulted in an increase in Nrf2 protein levels and subsequent activation of ARE pathway genes in primary cultured neurons. The protective effects of eriodictyol were attenuated by RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Nrf2 expression. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that eriodictyol protects neurons against Abeta25-35-induced cell death partially through Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway, which further supports that eriodictyol might be a promising novel therapeutic agent for AD.",

    "title": "Destabilization of Alzheimer's Abeta42 Protofibrils with a Novel Drug Candidate wgx-50 by Molecular Dynamics Simulations.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common dementia. The aggregation and deposition of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in neural tissue is its characteristic symptom. To destabilize and dissolve Abeta fibrils, a number of candidate molecules have been proposed. wgx-50 is a compound extracted from Sichuan pepper (Zanthoxylum bungeanum) and a potential candidate drug for treating AD. Our early experiments show it is effective in disassembling Abeta42 aggregations. A series of molecular dynamics simulations were performed in this work to explain the molecular mechanism of the destabilization of Abeta42 protofibril by wgx-50. It is found that there were three possible stable binding sites including two sites in hydrophobic grooves on surface of Abeta protofibril that made no significant changes in Abeta structures and one site in the interior that caused destabilization of the protofibril. In this site, wgx-50 was packed against the side chains of I32 and L34, disrupted the D23-K28 salt bridges, and partially opened the tightly compacted two beta-sheets. The results were confirmed by simulations at 320 K, where deeper insertion of wgx-50 into the whole protofibril was observed. The molecular mechanism of this novel drug candidate wgx-50 to disaggregate Abeta protofibril may provide some insight into the strategy of structure-based drug design for AD.",

    "title": "Beta-amyloid plasma levels in adolescents with anorexia nervosa of the restrictive type.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reduced plasma leptin and elevated homocysteine (Hcy) are known to lead to increased beta-amyloid (Abeta) production, besides being hallmarks of anorexia nervosa (AN) of the restrictive type. AN subjects display several neuropsychiatric manifestations, which may entail Abeta-mediated altered synaptic functions. The aim of this study consisted in assessing Abeta plasma levels in AN patients. METHODS: A total of 24 adolescent female AN outpatients were recruited together with 12 age-comparable healthy controls. For each subject we assessed Abeta40 and leptin plasma levels, as well as APOE genotype. Hcy plasma levels were also determined in AN patients who underwent clinical characterization, including the Eating Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3), the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the estimation of the speed of BMI loss (DPI, disease progression index). RESULTS: Plasma Abeta40 levels were similar between patients and controls, while a marked reduction was observed for leptin (~80%) in AN patients. Abeta40 plasma levels failed to correlate with leptin, while a linear correlation was present with Hcy (r = 0.50, p < 0.03). Examined clinical features were not related with Abeta40 plasma levels, with the only exception of the DPI (r = 0.47, p < 0.03). CONCLUSION: This exploratory study does not support a significant role for altered Abeta production in AN-associated dysfunctions. Further studies are required to clarify whether exceptions to this conclusion can be drawn for those patients expressing significantly elevated Hcy plasma levels or for those progressing more rapidly.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide accumulation in the brain. CALHM1, a cell-surface Ca(2+) channel expressed in brain neurons, has anti-amyloidogenic properties in cell cultures. Here, we show that CALHM1 controls Abeta levels in vivo in the mouse brain through a previously unrecognized mechanism of regulation of Abeta clearance. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches in cell lines, we found that CALHM1 ion permeability and extracellular Ca(2+) were required for the Abeta-lowering effect of CALHM1. Abeta level reduction by CALHM1 could be explained by an increase in extracellular Abeta degradation by insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), extracellular secretion of which was strongly potentiated by CALHM1 activation. Importantly, Calhm1 knockout in mice reduced IDE enzymatic activity in the brain, and increased endogenous Abeta concentrations by up to ~50% in both the whole brain and primary neurons. Thus, CALHM1 controls Abeta levels in cell lines and in vivo by facilitating neuronal and Ca(2+)-dependent degradation of extracellular Abeta by IDE. This work identifies CALHM1 ion channel as a potential target for promoting amyloid clearance in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "The presence of amyloid plaques composed of amyloid beta (Abeta) fibrils is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Abeta peptide is present as several length variants with two common alloforms consisting of 40 and 42 amino acids, denoted Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42, respectively. While there have been numerous reports that structurally characterize fibrils of Abeta1-40, very little is known about the structure of amyloid fibrils of Abeta1-42, which are considered the more toxic alloform involved in AD. We have prepared isotopically (13)C/(15)N labeled AbetaM01-42 fibrils in vitro from recombinant protein and examined their (13)C-(13)C and (13)C-(15)N magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectra. In contrast to several other studies of Abeta fibrils, we observe spectra with excellent resolution and a single set of chemical shifts, suggesting the presence of a single fibril morphology. We report the initial structural characterization of AbetaM01-42 fibrils utilizing (13)C and (15)N shift assignments of 38 of the 43 residues, including the backbone and side chains, obtained through a series of cross-polarization based 2D and 3D (13)C-(13)C, (13)C-(15)N MAS NMR experiments for rigid residues along with J-based 2D TOBSY experiments for dynamic residues. We find that the first ~5 residues are dynamic and most efficiently detected in a J-based TOBSY spectrum. In contrast, residues 16-42 are easily observed in cross-polarization experiments and most likely form the amyloid core. Calculation of psi and phi dihedral angles from the chemical shift assignments indicate that 4 beta-strands are present in the fibril's secondary structure.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation is a key feature of early Alzheimer's disease and precedes the appearance of Abeta in extracellular plaques. Abeta is generated through proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), but the intracellular site of Abeta production is unclear. APP has been localized to multivesicular bodies (MVBs) where sorting of APP onto intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) could promote amyloidogenic processing, or reduce Abeta production or accumulation by sorting APP and processing products to lysosomes for degradation. Here, we show that APP localizes to the ILVs of a subset of MVBs that also traffic EGF receptor (EGFR), and that it is delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Depletion of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) components, Hrs (also known as Hgs) or Tsg101, inhibited targeting of APP to ILVs and the subsequent delivery to lysosomes, and led to increased intracellular Abeta accumulation. This was accompanied by dramatically decreased Abeta secretion. Thus, the early ESCRT machinery has a dual role in limiting intracellular Abeta accumulation through targeting of APP and processing products to the lysosome for degradation, and promoting Abeta secretion.",

    "abstract": "Antibody-mediated capture of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in peripheral blood was identified as an attractive strategy to eliminate cerebral toxic amyloid in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and murine models. Alternatively, defective capacity of peripheral monocytes to engulf Abeta was reported in individuals with AD. In this report, we developed different approaches to investigate cellular uptake and phagocytosis of Abeta, and to examine how two immunological devices--an immunostimulatory Adjuvant System and different amyloid specific antibodies--may affect these biological events. Between one and thirteen months of age, APPswe X PS1.M146V (TASTPM) AD model mice had decreasing concentrations of Abeta in their plasma. In contrast, the proportion of blood monocytes containing Abeta tended to increase with age. Importantly, the TLR-agonist containing Adjuvant System AS01B primed monocytes to promote de novo Abeta uptake capacity, particularly in the presence of anti-Abeta antibodies. Biochemical experiments demonstrated that cells achieved Abeta uptake and internalization followed by Abeta degradation via mechanisms that required effective actin polymerization and proteolytic enzymes such as insulin-degrading enzyme. We further demonstrated that both Abeta-specific monoclonal antibodies and plasma from Abeta-immunized mice enhanced the phagocytosis of 1 mum Abeta-coated particles. Together, our data highlight a new biomarker testing to follow amyloid clearance within the blood and a mechanism of Abeta uptake by peripheral monocytes in the context of active or passive immunization, and emphasize on novel approaches to investigate this phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of DepoText, a text messaging reminder system designed to improve moderately long-acting reversible contraception appointment attendance among young urban adolescent girls and young adult women using Depo-Provera. METHODS: Female patients aged 13-21 years willing to be randomized, using Depo-Provera, and owning a cell phone with text messaging were recruited from an urban academic practice in a community with high rates of unplanned pregnancy for this institutional review board-approved randomized controlled pilot trial. Participants completed a baseline Web-based survey and were followed for three injection cycles. Intervention participants received welcome, appointment, and healthy self-management messages using the Compliance for Life short messaging system platform over each injection cycle. Compliance for Life recorded outgoing and incoming communications, and patients were tracked for clinical behaviors. The log-transformed number of days between scheduled appointment and injection was analyzed using linear regression. RESULTS: Recruitment data show 95% eligibility and 91% enrollment rates with maximum enrollment completion in 3 months. Most were African-American and resided in low-income, single-parent, and mother-headed households. Most participants had cell phone plans that included unlimited text messaging and Internet access and completed all three Depo-Provera cycles. Intervention participants returned closer to their scheduled appointments than their control peers for the first visit (Beta = -.75; 95% confidence interval, -1.4 to .06; p = .03) but not for the second and third visits. CONCLUSIONS: The DepoText intervention is acceptable, feasible, and shows short-term preliminary efficacy for improving clinic attendance for moderately long-acting reversible contraception appointments. Additional research exploring the cost and longitudinal prevention effectiveness is warranted.",

RESULTS: We conducted a time-course analysis of Abeta42 level in the model and found an age-dependent elevation of Abeta42 accumulation, closely correlated to the age-dependent decline of climbing ability in the model flies.

    "abstract": "PICALM is a highly validated genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that reduced expression of PICALM in AD and murine brain endothelium correlated with amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology and cognitive impairment. Moreover, Picalm deficiency diminished Abeta clearance across the murine blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accelerated Abeta pathology in a manner that was reversible by endothelial PICALM re-expression. Using human brain endothelial monolayers, we found that PICALM regulated PICALM/clathrin-dependent internalization of Abeta bound to the low density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1, a key Abeta clearance receptor, and guided Abeta trafficking to Rab5 and Rab11, leading to Abeta endothelial transcytosis and clearance. PICALM levels and Abeta clearance were reduced in AD-derived endothelial monolayers, which was reversible by adenoviral-mediated PICALM transfer. Inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived human endothelial cells carrying the rs3851179 protective allele exhibited higher PICALM levels and enhanced Abeta clearance. Thus, PICALM regulates Abeta BBB transcytosis and clearance, which has implications for Abeta brain homeostasis and clearance therapy.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a large number of amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits in the brain. Therefore, inhibiting Abeta aggregation or destabilizing preformed aggregates could be a promising therapeutic target for halting/slowing the progression of AD. Chitosan oligosaccharides (COS) have previously been reported to exhibit antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. Recent study shows that COS could markedly decrease oligomeric Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and oxidative stress in rat hippocampal neurons. However, the potential mechanism that COS reduce Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity remains unclear. In the present study, our findings from circular dichroism spectroscopy, transmission electron microscope and thioflavin T fluorescence assay suggested that COS act as an inhibitor of Abeta aggregation and this effect shows dose-dependency. Moreover, data from thioflavin T assay indicated that COS could significantly inhibit fibrils formation and disrupt preformed fibrils in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the addition of COS attenuated Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity in rat cortical neurons. Taken together, our results demonstrated for the first time that COS could inhibit Abeta1-42 fibrils formation and disaggregate preformed fibrils, suggesting that COS may have anti-Abeta fibrillogenesis and fibril-destabilizing properties. These findings highlight the potential role of COS as novel therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a biologically complex neurodegenerative dementia. Nearly 20 years ago, with the combination of observations from biochemistry, neuropathology and genetics, a compelling hypothesis known as the amyloid cascade hypothesis was formulated. The core of this hypothesis is that it is pathological accumulations of amyloid-beta, a peptide fragment of a membrane protein called amyloid precursor protein, that act as the root cause of AD and initiate its pathogenesis. Yet, with the passage of time, growing amounts of data have accumulated that are inconsistent with the basically linear structure of this hypothesis. And while there is fear in the field over the consequences of rejecting it outright, clinging to an inaccurate disease model is the option we should fear most. This Perspective explores the proposition that we are over-reliant on amyloid to define and diagnose AD and that the time has come to face our fears and reject the amyloid cascade hypothesis.",

The amyloid hypothesis postulates that amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is the causative agent in AD. It is strongly supported by data from rare autosomal dominant forms of AD. However, the evidence that Abeta causes or contributes to age-associated sporadic AD is more complex and less clear, prompting criticism of the hypothesis. We provide an overview of the major arguments for and against the amyloid hypothesis. We conclude that Abeta likely is the key initiator of a complex pathogenic cascade that causes AD. However, we argue that Abeta acts primarily as a trigger of other downstream processes, particularly tau aggregation, which mediate neurodegeneration. Abeta appears to be necessary, but not sufficient, to cause AD. Its major pathogenic effects may occur very early in the disease process.",

Recent studies have demonstrated the capability of ESI-IMS-MS to identify small molecule modulators of amyloid assembly and to determine the mechanism by which they interact (positive, negative, non-specific binding, or colloidal) in a high-throughput format.

    "abstract": "Nonfibrillar neurotoxic amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomer structures are typically rich in beta-sheets, which could be promoted by metal ions like Zn(2+). Here, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we systematically examined combinations of Abeta40 peptide conformations and Zn(2+) binding modes to probe the effects of secondary structure on Abeta dimerization energies and kinetics. We found that random conformations do not contribute to dimerization either thermodynamically or kinetically. Zn(2+) couples with preformed secondary structures (alpha-helix and beta-hairpin) to speed dimerization and stabilize the resulting dimer. Partial alpha-helices increase the dimerization speed, and dimers with alpha-helix rich conformations have the lowest energy. When Zn(2+) coordinates with residues D1, H6, H13, and H14, Abeta40 beta-hairpin monomers have the fastest dimerization speed. Dimers with experimentally observed zinc coordination (E11, H6, H13, and H14) form with slower rate but have lower energy. Zn(2+) cannot stabilize fibril-like beta-arch dimers. However, Zn(2+)-bound beta-arch tetramers have the lowest energy. Collectively, zinc-stabilized beta-hairpin oligomers could be important in the nucleation-polymerization of cross-beta structures. Our results are consistent with experimental findings that alpha-helix to beta-structural transition should accompany Abeta aggregation in the presence of zinc ions and that Zn(2+) stabilizes nonfibrillar Abeta oligomers and, thus, inhibits formation of less toxic Abeta fibrils.",

One of the useful methods in such cases is individual forming of polypropylene-polyester knitwear. Such material was used in the past but before 2008 it was available only as standardized plates. Currently, it can be also produced as individually-shaped implants. The authors give their definition of very large cranial defects and present their experience with this cranioplastic method in such defects. METHODS: The authors collected data on 11 cases of patients with very large cranial defects, from a total of 156 cases, operated on in 5 Polish neurosurgical departments. The necessary implants were prepared for individual patients according to the data provided by a computed tomography examination and with the use of computer aided machining. RESULTS: All defects were larger than 120 cm2 (129 to 178 cm2) and exceeded 1/4 of the calvaria area. Patients were operated between 2008 to 2012. In all patients, a very good aesthetic result and correct skull reconstruction was achieved. The follow-up time in all cases exceeded 1 year and reached 4 years in one case. No complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Individually pre-shaped polypropylene-polyester knitwear prostheses are a good alternative to the existing cranioplasty methods, particularly in very large cranial defects.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta accumulation, with soluble oligomers (Abetao) being the most synaptotoxic. However, the multivalent and unstable nature of Abetao limits molecular characterization and hinders research reproducibility. Here, we characterized multiple Abetao forms throughout the life span of various AD mice and in post-mortem human brain. Abetao exists in several populations, where prion protein (PrP(C))-interacting Abetao is a high molecular weight Abeta assembly present in multiple mice and humans with AD. Levels of PrP(C)-interacting Abetao match closely with mouse memory and are equal or superior to other Abeta measures in predicting behavioral impairment. However, Abetao metrics vary considerably between mouse strains. Deleting PrP(C) expression in mice with relatively low PrP(C)-interacting Abetao (Tg2576) results in partial rescue of cognitive performance as opposed to complete recovery in animals with a high percentage of PrP(C)-interacting Abetao (APP/PSEN1).

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Physical activity reduces the incidence and progression of cognitive impairment. Cognitive-motor dual-task training, which requires dividing attention between cognitive tasks and exercise, may improve various cognitive domains; therefore, we examined the effect of dual-task training on the executive functions and on plasma amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) 42/40 ratio, a potent biomarker of Alzheimer's disease, in healthy elderly people. METHODS: Twenty-seven sedentary elderly people participated in a 12-week randomized, controlled trial. The subjects assigned to the dual-task training (DT) group underwent a specific cognitive-motor dual-task training, and then the clinical outcomes, including cognitive functions by the Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) examination and the Trail-Making Test (TMT), and the plasma Abeta 42/40 ratio following the intervention were compared with those of the control single-task training (ST) group by unpaired t-test. RESULTS: Among 27 participants, 25 completed the study. The total scores in the 3MS examination as well as the muscular strength of quadriceps were equally improved in both groups after the training. The specific cognitive domains, \"registration & recall\", \"attention\", \"verbal fluency & understanding\", and \"visuospatial skills\" were significantly improved only in the DT group. Higher scores in \"attention\", \"verbal fluency & understanding\", and \"similarities\" were found in the DT group than in the ST group at post-intervention. The absolute changes in the total (8.5 +- 1.6 vs 2.4 +- 0.9, p = 0.004, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.75-3.39) and in the scores of \"attention\" (1.9 +- 0.5 vs -0.2 +- 0.4, p = 0.004, 95 % CI 2.25-9.98) were greater in the DT group than in the ST group. We found no changes in the TMT results in either group. Plasma Abeta 42/40 ratio decreased in both groups following the training (ST group: 0.63 +- 0.13 to 0.16 +- 0.03, p = 0.001; DT group: 0.60 +- 0.12 to 0.25 +- 0.06, p = 0.044), although the pre- and post-intervention values were not different between the groups for either measure. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive-motor dual-task training was more beneficial than single-task training alone in improving broader domains of cognitive functions of elderly persons, and the improvement was not directly due to modulating Abeta metabolism.",

    "abstract": "A large body of evidence support major roles of mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin action in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. However, interaction between cellular expression of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and insulin resistance on mitochondrial metabolism has not been explored in neuronal cells. We investigated the additive and synergistic effects of intracellular Abeta42 and ceramide-induced insulin resistance on mitochondrial metabolism in SH-SY5Y and Neuro-2a cells. In our model, mitochondria take-up Abeta42 expressed through viral-mediated transfection and exposure of the same cells to ceramide produces resistance to insulin signaling. Ceramide alone increased phosphorylated MAP kinases while decreasing phospho-Akt (Ser473). The combination of Abeta42 and ceramide synergistically decreased phospho-Thr308 on Akt. Abeta42 and ceramide synergistically also decreased mitochondrial complex III activity and ATP generation whereas Abeta alone was largely responsible for complex IV inhibition and increases in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production (ROS). Proteomic analysis showed that a number of mitochondrial respiratory chain and tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes were additively or synergistically decreased by ceramide in combination with Abeta42 expression. Mitochondrial fusion and fission proteins were notably dysregulated by Abeta42 (Mfn1) or Abeta42 plus ceramide (OPA1, Drp1). Antioxidant vitamins blocked the Abeta42 alone-induced ROS production, but did not reverse Abeta42-induced ATP reduction or complex IV inhibition. Abeta expression combined with ceramide exposure had additive effects to decrease cell viability. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Abeta42 expression and ceramide-induced insulin resistance synergistically interact to exacerbate mitochondrial damage and that therapeutic efforts to reduce insulin resistance could lessen failures of energy production and mitochondrial dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid precursor protein, which generates amyloid beta peptides, is intimately associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. We previously showed that transgenic mice overexpressing amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD), a peptide generated simultaneously with amyloid beta, develop AD-like pathologies, including hyperphosphorylated tau, loss of synapses, and memory impairments. AICD is known to bind c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-interacting protein 1 (JIP1), a scaffold protein that associates with and activates JNK. The aim of this study was to examine the role of JIP1 in AICD-induced AD-like pathologies in vivo, since the JNK pathway is aberrantly activated in AD brains and contributes to AD pathologies. We generated AICD-Tg mice lacking the JIP1 gene (AICD; JIP1(-/-)) and found that although AICD; JIP1(-/-) mice exhibit increased AICD, the absence of JIP1 results in decreased levels of hyperphosphorylated tau and activated JNK. AICD; JIP1(-/-) mice are also protected from synaptic loss and show improved performance in behavioral tests. These results suggest that JIP1 mediates AD-like pathologies in AICD-Tg mice and that JNK signaling may contribute to amyloid-independent mechanisms of AD pathogenesis.",

    "title": "Histone H1 Favors Folding and Parallel Fibrillar Aggregation of the 1-42 Amyloid-beta Peptide.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system. The aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide, Abeta(1-42), is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Histone H1 is found in the cytoplasm of neurons in AD, and it has been shown to interact with aggregated amyloid-beta peptides and with amyloid fibrils. We have used Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence enhancement, circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD), coprecipitation, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to study the interaction of histone H1 with Abeta(1-42). Both freshly prepared (monomeric) Abeta(1-42) and histone H1 solutions showed negative CD bands typical of the random coil. Mixing Abeta(1-42) and histone H1 led to the loss of the random coil, which was replaced mostly by beta-structure. Therefore, both Abeta(1-42) and histone H1 behave as intrinsically disordered proteins with coupled binding and folding. Mutual structure induction demonstrates the interaction of Abeta(1-42) and histone H1. The interaction was confirmed by coprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE. Mutual structure induction was also observed with the H1 terminal domains. Incubation of Abeta(1-42) for 1 week in the presence of histone H1 led to the formation of laminar aggregates and thick bundles, characterized by the parallel association of large numbers of fibrils. The aggregates were particularly large and ordered with the H1 subtype H1.2. Further aging of the complexes led to tight compaction of fibril bundles and to fiber growth. Stabilization of fibril-fibril interactions appeared to be determined by the C-terminal domain of histone H1. In summary, these observations indicate that histone H1 has at least two effects: it helps the folding of Abeta monomers and stabilizes the parallel association of fibrils.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) is one of the main actors in AD pathogenesis. Abeta is characterized by its high tendency to self-associate, leading to the generation of oligomers and amyloid fibrils. The elucidation of pathways and intermediates is crucial for the understanding of protein assembly mechanisms in general and in conjunction with neurodegenerative diseases, e.g., for the identification of new therapeutic targets. Our study focused on Abeta42 and its oligomeric assemblies in the lag phase of amyloid formation, as studied by sedimentation velocity (SV) centrifugation. The assembly state of Abeta during the lag phase, the time required by an Abeta solution to reach the exponential growth phase of aggregation, was characterized by a dominant monomer fraction below 1 S and a population of oligomeric species between 4 and 16 S. From the oligomer population, two major species close to a 12-mer and an 18-mer with a globular shape were identified. The recurrence of these two species at different initial concentrations and experimental conditions as the smallest assemblies present in solution supports the existence of distinct, energetically favored assemblies in solution. The sizes of the two species suggest an Abeta42 aggregation pathway that is based on a basic hexameric building block. The study demonstrates the potential of SV analysis for the evaluation of protein aggregation pathways.",

    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease, accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is associated with loss of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synapses, and memory. Previous work demonstrated that Abeta decreases activity-induced BDNF transcription by regulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. However, the specific mechanism by which Abeta reduces basal BDNF expression remains unclear. Differentiated, unstimulated human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells treated with oligomeric Abeta exhibited significantly reduced CREB messenger RNA compared with controls. Phosphorylated and total CREB proteins were decreased in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of Abeta-treated cells. However, neither pCREB129 nor pCREB133 levels were altered relative to total CREB levels. The protein kinase A activator forskolin increased pCREB133 levels and prevented Abeta-induced basal BDNF loss when administered before Abeta but did not rescue BDNF expression when administered later. These data demonstrate a new mechanism for Abeta-induced BDNF downregulation: in the absence of cell stimulation, Abeta downregulates basal BDNF levels via Abeta-induced CREB transcriptional downregulation, not changes in CREB phosphorylation. Thus, Abeta reduces basal and activity-induced BDNF expression by different mechanisms.",

However, some data are controversial and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this report, two populations of Abeta were found in human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. Notably, one of the Abeta populations was tightly inserted into the plasma membrane whilst the other was only peripherally associated with it. Here we show that reducing membrane cholesterol decreased the number of membrane-embedded Abetas and increased the number of membrane-attached Abetas. We also found that cholesterol depletion inhibited Abeta degradation and exacerbated Abeta-mediated cytotoxicity. Our detailed and direct observations provide specific insights into the mechanism of Abeta membrane-associated toxicity.",

While both are therapeutically promising, not much is known about their interactions with proteins other than gamma-secretase. Signal peptide peptidase (SPP), like gamma-secretase, is a multispan transmembrane aspartyl protease that catalyzes regulated intramembrane proteolysis. We used active site-directed photophore walking probes to study the effects of different GSIs and GSMs on the active sites of gamma-secretase and SPP and found that nontransition state GSIs inhibit labeling of gamma-secretase by activity-based probes but enhance labeling of SPP. The opposite is true of GSMs, which have little effect on the labeling of gamma-secretase but diminish labeling of SPP. These results demonstrate that GSIs and GSMs are altering the structure of not only gamma-secretase but also SPP, leading to potential changes in enzyme activity and specificity that may impact the clinical outcomes of these molecules.",

However, whether the influence of beta-amyloid pathology on hippocampus-dependent memory is, in part, driven by impairments of NREM slow wave activity (SWA) and associated overnight memory consolidation is unknown. Here we show that beta-amyloid burden in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) correlates significantly with the severity of impairment in NREM SWA generation. Moreover, reduced NREM SWA generation was further associated with impaired overnight memory consolidation and impoverished hippocampal-neocortical memory transformation. Furthermore, structural equation models revealed that the association between mPFC beta-amyloid pathology and impaired hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation was not direct, but instead statistically depended on the intermediary factor of diminished NREM SWA. By linking beta-amyloid pathology with impaired NREM SWA, these data implicate sleep disruption as a mechanistic pathway through which beta-amyloid pathology may contribute to hippocampus-dependent cognitive decline in the elderly.",

Novel neuroimaging techniques can help elucidating how these disorders spread across brain networks. Recent knowledge from structural and functional connectivity studies suggests that the relation between neurodegenerative diseases and distinct brain networks is likely to be a strict consequence of diffuse network dynamics. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging also showed that measurement of white matter tract involvement can be a valid surrogate to assess the in vivo spreading of pathological proteins in these conditions. This review will introduce briefly the main molecular and pathological substrates of the most frequent neurodegenerative diseases and provide a comprehensive overview of neuroimaging findings that support the \"network-based neurodegeneration\" hypothesis in these disorders.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal and complex neurodegenerative disorder for which effective treatment remains the unmet challenge. Using donepezil as a starting point, we aimed to develop novel potential anti-AD agents with a multidirectional biological profile. We designed the target compounds as dual binding site acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, where the N-benzylamine pharmacophore is responsible for interactions with the catalytic anionic site of the enzyme. The heteroaromatic fragment responsible for interactions with the peripheral anionic site was modified and three different heterocycles were introduced: isoindoline, isoindolin-1-one, and saccharine. Based on the results of the pharmacological evaluation, we identified compound 8b with a saccharine moiety as the most potent and selective human acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (IC50  = 33 nM) and beta amyloid aggregation inhibitor. It acts as a non-competitive acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and is able to cross the blood-brain barrier in vitro. We believe that compound 8b represents an important lead compound for further development as potential anti-AD agent.",

Our aim was to evaluate whether polymorphisms previously established as predictors of LOAD also predict worse cognitive function and accelerated decline across multiple cognitive domains. We analyzed data from the 3C-Dijon study, in which 4931 respondents aged 65+ were examined up to 5 times over 10 years with a neuropsychological assessment. We evaluated the associations of polymorphisms in APOE, CR1, BIN1, CLU, PICALM, ABCA7, MS4A6A, CD33, MS4A4E and CD2AP with level and change in 5 neuropsychological tests, assuming a dominant effect model. To optimize measurement, we used a mixed regression model with a latent process for each cognitive domain: global cognition (Mini Mental State Examination); verbal fluency (Isaac's Set Test); visual memory (Benton Visual Retention Test); information processing (Trail Making Test B) and literacy (National Adult Reading Test). APOE was associated with accelerated decline in global cognition and verbal fluency. Only two non-APOE genetic polymorphisms were associated with cognitive decline: CR1 was associated with rate of change in verbal fluency and BIN1 was associated with rate of change in global cognition. In a large prospective population-based study of dementia-free individuals, only a few cognitive domains were associated with established LOAD risk alleles. The most consistent associations were for global cognition and verbal fluency.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers amyloid-beta (Abeta), tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau181) are now used for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta40 is the most abundant Abeta peptide isoform in the CSF, and the Abeta 42/40 ratio has been proposed to better reflect brain amyloid production. However, its additional value in the clinical setting remains uncertain. METHODS: A total of 367 subjects with cognitive disorders who underwent a lumbar puncture were prospectively included at three French memory centers (Paris-North, Lille and Montpellier; the PLM Study). The frequency of positive, negative and indeterminate CSF profiles were assessed by various methods, and their adequacies with the diagnosis of clinicians were tested using net reclassification improvement (NRI) analyses. RESULTS: On the basis of local optimum cutoffs for Abeta42 and p-tau181, 22% of the explored patients had indeterminate CSF profiles. The systematic use of Abeta 42/40 ratio instead of Abeta42 levels alone decreased the number of indeterminate profiles (17%; P = 0.03), but it failed to improve the classification of subjects (NRI = -2.1%; P = 0.64). In contrast, the use of Abeta 42/40 ratio instead of Abeta42 levels alone in patients with a discrepancy between p-tau181 and Abeta42 led to a reduction by half of the number of indeterminate profiles (10%; P < 0.001) and was further in agreement with clinician diagnosis (NRI = 10.5%; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a discrepancy between CSF p-tau181 and CSF Abeta42, the assessment of Abeta 42/40 ratio led to a reliable biological conclusion in over 50% of cases that agreed with a clinician's diagnosis.",

We therefore sought to determine the relationship between age, amyloidosis, and amyloid-beta (Abeta) kinetics in the central nervous system (CNS) of humans. METHODS: Abeta kinetics were analyzed in 112 participants and compared to the ages of participants and the amount of amyloid deposition. RESULTS: We found a highly significant correlation between increasing age and slowed Abeta turnover rates (2.5-fold longer half-life over five decades of age). In addition, we found independent effects on Abeta42 kinetics specifically in participants with amyloid deposition. Amyloidosis was associated with a higher (>50%) irreversible loss of soluble Abeta42 and a 10-fold higher Abeta42 reversible exchange rate. INTERPRETATION: These findings reveal a mechanistic link between human aging and the risk of amyloidosis, which may be owing to a dramatic slowing of Abeta turnover, increasing the likelihood of protein misfolding that leads to deposition. Alterations in Abeta kinetics associated with aging and amyloidosis suggest opportunities for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. More generally, this study provides an example of how changes in protein turnover kinetics can be used to detect physiological and pathophysiological changes and may be applicable to other proteinopathies.",

    "abstract": "Modulation of protein self-assembly has been a powerful strategy for controlling and understanding amyloid protein aggregation. Most modulators of amyloid aggregation only involve simple inhibition or acceleration. Here we report a new multivalent molecular motif, the polyethylenimine-perphenazine (PEI-P) conjugate which has a dual \"acceleration-inhibition\" modulation effect on amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation. Dose dependent results from Thioflavin T fluorescence assays, circular dichroism, and atomic force microscopy show that PEI-P conjugates accelerate formation of Abeta prefibrillar intermediates and then inhibit Abeta fibrillation. Furthermore, compared to perphenazine alone, PEI-P conjugates exhibit an enhanced inhibitory effect due to multivalency. Cell viability assays indicate that the PEI-P conjugates reduce the cytotoxicity of Abeta aggregates in a dose-dependent manner. This new modulation strategy may shed light on controlling amyloid aggregation, which offers a general concept for designing new modulators.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether neuroimaging biomarkers of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and neurodegeneration (ND) are associated with greater self-reported subjective cognitive concerns (SCC) in clinically normal older individuals. METHODS: A total of 257 participants underwent Pittsburgh compound B PET, PET with fluorodeoxyglucose (18)F, and structural MRI, as well as a battery of neuropsychological measures including several questionnaires regarding SCC. Individuals were classified into 4 biomarker groups: biomarker negative (Abeta-/ND-), amyloidosis alone (Abeta+/ND-), amyloidosis plus ND (Abeta+/ND+), and ND alone (Abeta-/ND+). RESULTS: Both Abeta and ND were independently associated with greater SCC controlling for objective memory performance. By contrast, neither Abeta nor ND was associated with objective memory performance controlling for SCC. Further examination revealed greater SCC in individuals with Abeta or ND positivity compared to biomarker-negative individuals. In addition, greater SCC predicted Abeta positivity when controlling for ND status. CONCLUSIONS: When individuals were grouped by biomarker status, those who were positive on Abeta or ND had the highest report of SCC compared to biomarker-negative individuals. Findings were consistent when SCC was used to predict Abeta positivity. Taken together, results suggest that both Abeta and ND are associated with SCC, independent of objective memory performance. Enrichment of individuals with SCC may increase likelihood of Abeta and ND markers in potential participants for secondary prevention trials.",

However, the effect of EPO on Abeta-induced Alzheimer-like cognitive deficits and pathological changes remains unclear.

    "abstract": "The intervertebral discs (IVDs) are roughly cylindrical, fibrocartilaginous, articulating structures connecting the vertebral bodies, and allowing movement in the otherwise rigid anterior portion of the vertebral column. They also transfer loads and dissipate energy. Macroscopically the intervertebral disc can be divided into an outer annulus fibrosus surrounding a centrally located nucleus pulposus. The endplates surround the IVD from both the cranial and caudal ends, and separate them from the vertebral bodies and prevent the highly hydrated nucleus pulposus from bulging into the adjacent vertebrae. The IVD develop from the mesodermal notochord and receive nutrients mostly through the cartilaginous endplates. Physiologically they are innervated only in the outer annulus fibrosus by sensory and sympathetic perivascular nerve fibres, branches from the sinuvertebral nerve, the ventral rami of spinal nerves or from the grey rami communicantes. The IVD undergo changes with ageing and degeneration, the latter having two types i.e. \"endplate-driven\" involving endplate defects and inward collapse of the annulus fibrosus and \"annulus-driven\" involving a radial fissure and/or an IVD prolapse. This review summarises and updates the current state of knowledge on the embryology, structure, and biomechanics of the IVD and its endplates. To further translate this into a more clinical context this review also demonstrates the impact of ageing and degeneration on the above properties of both the IVD and its endplates.",

We found that at sub-micromolar concentrations, Q1 selectively decreased the mitochondrial iron pool and was extremely effective in protecting against rotenone-induced oxidative damage and death. Q4, in turn, preferentially chelated the cytoplasmic iron pool and presented a decreased capacity to protect against rotenone-induced oxidative damage and death. Oral administration of Q1 to mice protected substantia nigra pars compacta neurons against oxidative damage and MPTP-induced death. Taken together, our results support the concept that oral administration of Q1 is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NBIA.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease can be a result of an age-induced disparity between increase in cellular metabolism of Abeta peptides and decrease in maximal activity of a membrane-embedded protease gamma-secretase. RESULTS: We compared activity of WT gamma-secretase with the activity of 6 FAD mutants in its presenilin-1 component and 5 FAD mutants in Abeta-part of its APP substrate (Familial Alzheimer's disease). All 11 FAD mutations show linear correlation between the decrease in maximal activity and the clinically observed age-of-onset and age-of-death. Biphasic-inhibitors showed that a higher ratio between physiological Abeta-production and the maximal activity of gamma-secretase can be observed in cells that can facilitate pathogenic changes in Abeta-products. For example, Abeta production in cells with WT gamma-secretase is at 11% of its maximal activity, with delta-exon-9 mutant at 26%, while with M139V mutant is at 28% of the maximal activity. In the same conditions, G384A mutant is fully saturated and at its maximal activity. Similarly, Abeta production in cells with gamma-secretase complex carrying Aph1AL component is 12% of its maximal activity, while in cells with Aph1B complex is 26% of its maximal activity. Similar to the cell-based studies, clinical studies of biphasic dose-response in plasma samples of 54 healthy individuals showed variable ratios between physiological Abeta production and the maximal activity of gamma-secretase. CONCLUSIONS: The increase in the ratio between physiological Abeta production and maximal activity of gamma-secretase can be an early sign of pathogenic processes in enzyme-based, cell-based, and clinical studies of sporadic and Familiar Alzheimer's disease.",

However, there are numerous potentially toxic oligomers and little is known about their neurological effects when generated in the living brain. Here we show that Abeta oligomers can be assigned to one of at least two classes (type 1 and type 2) based on their temporal, spatial, and structural relationships to amyloid fibrils. The type 2 oligomers are related to amyloid fibrils and represent the majority of oligomers generated in vivo, but they remain confined to the vicinity of amyloid plaques and do not impair cognition at levels relevant to AD. Type 1 oligomers are unrelated to amyloid fibrils and may have greater potential to cause global neural dysfunction in AD because they are dispersed.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently being addressed by intensive investment in pre-clinical and clinical research on the amyloid hypothesis, but concern remains about the validity of the concept that soluble Abeta oligomers are principally responsible for initiating AD phenotypes. Here, we apply well-defined Abeta oligomers isolated from AD brains or made synthetically to document a systematic accrual of first subtle and then more profound changes in certain synaptic proteins in both primary neuronal cultures and behaving adult mice. Among the first (within hours) synaptic changes are selective decreases in surface levels of certain (e.g., GluA1) but not other (e.g., GluN2B) glutamate receptors and subtle microglial activation. After 4 days, numerous additional synaptic proteins are altered. Moreover, Abeta oligomers induce hyperphosphorylation of tau and subsequent neuritic dystrophy. All changes are prevented by scyllo-inositol in a dose- and stereoisomer-specific manner. Mechanistically, scyllo-inositol interferes quantitatively with the binding of Abeta oligomers to plasma membranes. These comprehensive analyses in culture and in vivo provide direct evidence that diffusible oligomers of human Abeta (without plaques) induce multiple phenotypic changes in healthy neurons, indicating their role as principal endogenous cytotoxins in AD. Our data recommend a re-examination of scyllo-inositol as an anti-oligomer therapeutic in humans with early AD.",

    "title": "Vitamin E: Curse or Benefit in Alzheimer's Disease? A Systematic Investigation of the Impact of alpha-, gamma- and delta-Tocopherol on Ass Generation and Degradation in Neuroblastoma Cells.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The E vitamins are a class of lipophilic compounds including tocopherols, which have high antioxidative properties. Because of the elevated lipid peroxidation and increased reactive oxidative species in Alzheimer's disease (AD) many attempts have been made to slow down the progression of AD by utilizing the antioxidative action of vitamin E. Beside the mixed results of these studies nothing is known about the impact of vitamin E on the mechanisms leading to amyloid-beta production and degradation being responsible for the plaque formation, one of the characteristic pathological hallmarks in AD. Here we systematically investigate the influence of different tocopherols on Abeta production and degradation in neuronal cell lines. MEASUREMENTS: Beside amyloid-beta level the mechanisms leading to Abeta production and degradation are examined. RESULTS: Surprisingly, all tocopherols have shown to increase Abeta level by enhancing the Abeta production and decreasing the Abeta degradation. Abeta production is enhanced by an elevated activity of the involved enzymes, the beta- and gamma-secretase. These secretases are not directly affected, but tocopherols increase their protein level and expression. We could identify significant differences between the single tocopherols; whereas alpha-tocopherol had only minor effects on Abeta production, delta-tocopherol showed the highest potency to increase Abeta generation. Beside Abeta production, Abeta clearance was decreased by affecting IDE, one of the major Abeta degrading enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that beside the beneficial antioxidative effects of vitamin E, tocopherol has in respect to AD also a potency to increase the amyloid-beta level, which differ for the analysed tocopherols. We therefore recommend that further studies are needed to clarify the potential role of these various vitamin E species in respect to AD and to identify the form which comprises an antioxidative property without having an amyloidogenic potential.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial biogenesis is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial content, morphology, and function. Impaired mitochondrial biogenesis has been observed in Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) has been shown to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured neurons, but its role in mitochondrial biogenesis in neurons remains poorly defined. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) are key energy-sensing molecules regulating mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1alpha), the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, is a target for SIRT1 deacetylase activity. In this study, we investigated the effects of Abeta25-35 on mitochondrial biogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons and the underlying mechanisms. In primary hippocampal neurons, we found that 24-h incubation with Abeta25-35 suppressed both phosphorylations of AMPK and SIRT1 expression and increased PGC-1alpha acetylation expression. In addition, Abeta25-35 also resulted in a decrease in mitochondrial DNA copy number, as well as decreases in the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis factors (PGC-1alpha, NRF 1, NRF 2, and Tfam). Taken together, these data show that Abeta25-35 suppresses mitochondrial biogenesis in hippocampal neurons. Abeta25-35-induced impairment of mitochondrial biogenesis may be associated with the inhibition of the AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1alpha pathway.",

    "abstract": "In a positron-emission tomography (PET) study with the beta-amyloid (Abeta) tracer [(18)F]-florbetaben, we previously showed that Abeta deposition in transgenic mice expressing Swedish mutant APP (APP-Swe) mice can be tracked in vivo. gamma-Secretase modulators (GSMs) are promising therapeutic agents by reducing generation of the aggregation prone Abeta42 species without blocking general gamma-secretase activity. We now aimed to investigate the effects of a novel GSM [8-(4-Fluoro-phenyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-yl]-[1-(3-methyl-[1,2,4]thiadiazol-5-yl)-piperidin-4-yl]-amine (RO5506284) displaying high potency in vitro and in vivo on amyloid plaque burden and used longitudinal Abeta-microPET to trace individual animals. Female transgenic (TG) APP-Swe mice aged 12 months (m) were assigned to vehicle (TG-VEH, n=12) and treatment groups (TG-GSM, n=12), which received daily RO5506284 (30 mg kg(-1)) treatment for 6 months. A total of 131 Abeta-PET recordings were acquired at baseline (12 months), follow-up 1 (16 months) and follow-up 2 (18 months, termination scan), whereupon histological and biochemical analyses of Abeta were performed. We analyzed the PET data as VOI-based cortical standard-uptake-value ratios (SUVR), using cerebellum as reference region. Individual plaque load assessed by PET remained nearly constant in the TG-GSM group during 6 months of RO5506284 treatment, whereas it increased progressively in the TG-VEH group. Baseline SUVR in TG-GSM mice correlated with Delta%-SUVR, indicating individual response prediction. Insoluble Abeta42 was reduced by 56% in the TG-GSM versus the TG-VEH group relative to the individual baseline plaque load estimates. Furthermore, plaque size histograms showed differing distribution between groups of TG mice, with fewer small plaques in TG-GSM animals. Taken together, in the first Abeta-PET study monitoring prolonged treatment with a potent GSM in an AD mouse model, we found clear attenuation of de novo amyloidogenesis. Moreover, longitudinal PET allows non-invasive assessment of individual plaque-load kinetics, thereby accommodating inter-animal variations.",

METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated self-reported histories of recent and past cognitive activity, self-reported history of recent physical activity, and objective recent walking activity in 186 clinically normal individuals with mean age of 74 +- 6 years. Using backward elimination general linear models, we tested the hypotheses that greater cognitive or physical activity would be associated with lower Pittsburgh compound B-PET retention, greater (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET metabolism, and larger hippocampal volume, as well as better cognitive performance on neuropsychological testing. RESULTS: Linear regression demonstrated that history of greater cognitive activity was correlated with greater estimated IQ and education, as well as better neuropsychological testing performance. Self-reported recent physical activity was related to objective exercise monitoring. However, contrary to hypotheses, we did not find evidence of an association of Pittsburgh compound B retention, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, or hippocampal volume with past or current levels of cognitive activity, or with current physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a history of lifelong cognitive activity may support better cognitive performance by a mechanism that is independent of brain beta-amyloid burden, brain glucose metabolism, or hippocampal volume.",

    "abstract": "Although amyloid fibrils and amorphous aggregates are two types of aggregates formed by denatured proteins, their relationship currently remains unclear. We used beta2-microglobulin (beta2m), a protein responsible for dialysis-related amyloidosis, to clarify the mechanism by which proteins form either amyloid fibrils or amorphous aggregates. When ultrasonication was used to accelerate the spontaneous fibrillation of beta2m at pH 2.0, the effects observed depended on ultrasonic power; although stronger ultrasonic power effectively accelerated fibrillation, excessively strong ultrasonic power decreased the amount of fibrils formed, as monitored by thioflavin T fluorescence. An analysis of the products formed indicated that excessively strong ultrasonic power generated fibrillar aggregates that retained beta-structures but without high efficiency as seeds. On the other hand, when the spontaneous fibrillation of beta2m was induced at higher concentrations of NaCl at pH 2.0 with stirring, amorphous aggregates became more dominant than amyloid fibrils. These apparent complexities in fibrillation were explained comprehensively by a competitive mechanism in which supersaturation-limited reactions competed with supersaturation-unlimited reactions. We link the kinetics of protein aggregation and a conformational phase diagram, in which supersaturation played important roles.",

    "abstract": "Self-assembly of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in human brain tissue leads to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid fibrils, whose structures have been extensively characterized by solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) and other methods, are the thermodynamic end point of Abeta self-assembly. Oligomeric and protofibrillar assemblies, whose structures are less well-understood, are also observed as intermediates in the assembly process in vitro and have been implicated as important neurotoxic species in AD. We report experiments in which the structural evolution of 40-residue Abeta (Abeta40) is monitored by ssNMR measurements on frozen solutions prepared at four successive stages of the self-assembly process. Measurements on transient intermediates are enabled by ssNMR signal enhancements from dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) at temperatures below 30 K. DNP-enhanced ssNMR data reveal a monotonic increase in conformational order from an initial state comprised primarily of monomers and small oligomers in solution at high pH, to larger oligomers near neutral pH, to metastable protofibrils, and finally to fibrils. Surprisingly, the predominant molecular conformation, indicated by (13)C NMR chemical shifts and by side chain contacts between F19 and L34 residues, is qualitatively similar at all stages. However, the in-register parallel beta-sheet supramolecular structure, indicated by intermolecular (13)C spin polarization transfers, does not develop before the fibril stage. This work represents the first application of DNP-enhanced ssNMR to the characterization of peptide or protein self-assembly intermediates.",

Nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, along with single-touch atomic force microscopy, are used to establish the structural transitions involved in fibril formation. We show that under conditions favorable for the nucleated conformation conversion, the Abeta42 peptide aggregates into largely unstructured low-molecular weight (MW) oligomers that are able to stack to form high-MW oligomers and to laterally associate to form protofibrils. beta-Sheet secondary structure develops during the irreversible lateral association of the oligomers. The first step in this conversion is the formation of an antiparallel beta-hairpin stabilized by intramonomer hydrogen bonding. The antiparallel beta-hairpins then associate into a cross beta-sheet structure with parallel and in-register beta-strands having intermonomer hydrogen bonding.",

    "abstract": "We have explored an effect of Hofmeister anions, Na2SO4, NaCl, NaBr, NaNO3, NaSCN and NaClO4, on stability and amyloid fibrillization of hen egg white lysozyme at pH 2.7. The stability of the protein was analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry. The Hofmeister effect of the anions was assessed by the parameter dT trs/d[anion] (T trs, transition temperature). We show that dT trs/d[anion] correlates with anion surface tension effects and anion partition coefficients indicating direct interactions between anions and lysozyme. The kinetic of amyloid fibrillization of lysozyme was followed by Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence. Negative correlation between dT trs/d[anion] and the nucleation rate of fibrillization in the presence of monovalent anions indicates specific effect of anions on fibrillization rate of lysozyme. The efficiency of monovalent anions to accelerate fibrillization correlates with inverse Hofmeister series. The far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy findings show that conformational properties of fibrils depend on fibrillization rate. In the presence of sodium chloride, lysozyme forms typical fibrils with elongated structure and with the secondary structure of the beta-sheet. On the other hand, in the presence of both chaotropic perchlorate and kosmotropic sulfate anions, the fibrils form clusters with secondary structure of beta-turn. Moreover, the acceleration of fibril formation is accompanied by decreased amount of the formed fibrils as indicated by ThT fluorescence. Taken together, our study shows Hofmeister effect of monovalent anions on: (1) lysozyme stability; (2) ability to accelerate nucleation phase of lysozyme fibrillization; (3) amount, and (4) conformational properties of the formed fibrils.",

Our previous studies have shown that icariin protects neurons from neurotoxic and ischemic conditions. This study aims to investigate the effect of icariin on the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the level of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), as well as neurogenesis in the brain of Tg2576 mice, an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tg2576 mice and wild-type littermates (WT) were randomized into the following three groups: Tg2576, Tg2576+icariin, and WT groups. All 9-month-old mice were treated with icariin (60mg/kg/d) or distilled water for 3months. Following this, the spatial working memory of Tg2576+icariin mice, as examined in the Y-maze task, was found to improve. Furthermore, reduced levels of insoluble Abeta1-40 (69%) and Abeta1-42 (50%) after icariin treatment were determined in the brain by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Western blot analysis indicated the downregulation of APP expression after icariin treatment, and double staining showed an increased number of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)/Neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) double-positive cells in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus in Tg2576+icariin mice compared with the Tg2576 mice. The current study demonstrated that icariin improved memory function, decreased the levels of Abeta and APP in the brain, and enhanced neurogenesis in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice. Collectively, these results suggest the potential therapeutic value of icariin in AD.",

    "abstract": "There is great interest in blood-based markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially in its pre-symptomatic stages. Therefore, we aimed to identify plasma proteins whose levels associate with potential markers of pre-symptomatic AD. We also aimed to characterise confounding by genetics and the effect of genetics on blood proteins in general. Panel-based proteomics was performed using SOMAscan on plasma samples from TwinsUK subjects who are asymptomatic for AD, measuring the level of 1129 proteins. Protein levels were compared with 10-year change in CANTAB-paired associates learning (PAL; n = 195), and regional brain volumes (n = 34). Replication of proteins associated with regional brain volumes was performed in 254 individuals from the AddNeuroMed cohort. Across all the proteins measured, genetic factors were found to explain ~26% of the variability in blood protein levels on average. The plasma level of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) MAPKAPK5 protein was found to positively associate with the 10-year change in CANTAB-PAL in both the individual and twin difference context. The plasma level of protein MAP2K4 was found to suggestively associate negatively (Q < 0.1) with the volume of the left entorhinal cortex. Future studies will be needed to assess the specificity of MAPKAPK5 and MAP2K4 to eventual conversion to AD.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid precursor protein (APP) derivative beta-amyloid (Abeta) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sequential proteolysis of APP by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase generates Abeta. Conversely, the alpha-secretase \"a disintegrin and metalloproteinase\" 10 (ADAM10) cleaves APP within the eventual Abeta sequence and precludes Abeta generation. Therefore, up-regulation of ADAM10 represents a plausible therapeutic strategy to combat overproduction of neurotoxic Abeta. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) is a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in fatty acid metabolism. Here, we determined that the Adam10 promoter harbors PPAR response elements; that knockdown of PPARalpha, but not PPARbeta or PPARgamma, decreases the expression of Adam10; and that lentiviral overexpression of PPARalpha restored ADAM10 expression in Ppara(-/-) neurons. Gemfibrozil, an agonist of PPARalpha, induced the recruitment of PPARalpha:retinoid x receptor alpha, but not PPARgamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC1alpha), to the Adam10 promoter in wild-type mouse hippocampal neurons and shifted APP processing toward the alpha-secretase, as determined by augmented soluble APPalpha and decreased Abeta production. Accordingly, Ppara(-/-) mice displayed elevated SDS-stable, endogenous Abeta and Abeta1-42 relative to wild-type littermates, whereas 5XFAD mice null for PPARalpha (5X/alpha(-/-)) exhibited greater cerebral Abeta load relative to 5XFAD littermates. These results identify PPARalpha as an important factor regulating neuronal ADAM10 expression and, thus, alpha-secretase proteolysis of APP.",

Whereas clinical biomarkers are not yet optimized, HS-Aging has distinctive pathological features that distinguish it from other diseases with \"hippocampal sclerosis\" pathology, such as epilepsy, cerebrovascular perturbations, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. By definition, HS-Aging brains show neuronal cell loss and gliosis in the hippocampal formation out of proportion to AD-type pathology; it is strongly associated with aberrant TDP-43 pathology and arteriolosclerosis. Here, we describe 2 cases of \"segmental\" HS-Aging in which \"sclerosis\" in the hippocampus was evident only in a subset of brain sections by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. In these cases, TDP-43 pathology was more widespread on immunostained sections than the neuronal cell loss and gliosis seen in H&E stains. The 2 patients were cognitively intact at baseline and were tracked longitudinally over a decade using cognitive studies with at least 1 neuroimaging scan. We discuss the relevant HS-Aging literature, which indicates the need for a clearer consensus-based delineation of \"hippocampal sclerosis\" and TDP-43 pathologies in aged subjects.",

    "abstract": "Human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contains diverse lipid particles, including lipoproteins that are distinct from their plasma counterparts and contain apolipoprotein (apo) E isoforms, apoJ, and apoAI, and extracellular vesicles, which can be detected by annexin V binding. The aim of this study was to develop a method to quantify CSF particles and evaluate their relationship to aging and neurodegenerative diseases. We used a flow cytometric assay to detect annexin V-, apoE-, apoAI-, apoJ-, and amyloid (A) beta42-positive particles in CSF from 131 research volunteers who were neurologically normal or had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia, or Parkinson disease. APOE epsilon4/epsilon4 participants had CSF apoE-positive particles that were more frequently larger but at an 88% lower level versus those in APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 or APOE epsilon3/epsilon4 patients; this finding was reproduced in conditioned medium from mouse primary glial cell cultures with targeted replacement of apoE. Cerebrospinal fluid apoE-positive and beta-amyloid (Abeta42)-positive particle concentrations were persistently reduced one-third to one-half in middle and older age subjects; apoAI-positive particle concentration progressively increased approximately 2-fold with age. Both apoAI-positive and annexin V-positive CSF particle levels were reduced one-third to one-half in CSF of MCI and/or AD dementia patients versus age-matched controls. Our approach provides new methods to investigate CNS lipid biology in relation to neurodegeneration and perhaps develop new biomarkers for diagnosis or treatment monitoring.",

Abeta may exert its neurotoxic effects via multiple mechanisms and in particular through degradation of excitatory synaptic transmission associated with impaired synaptic plasticity. In contrast, much less is known about Abeta effects at inhibitory synapses. This study investigates the impact of acute Abeta1-42 application on GABAergic synaptic transmission in rat somatosensory cortex in vitro. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from layer V pyramidal cells, and monosynaptic GABA(A) receptor-mediated IPSCs were elicited. Bath-applied Abeta (1 mum) depressed the IPSCs on average to 60% of control, whereas a reversed sequence control peptide was ineffective. Paired-pulse stimuli indicated a postsynaptic site of action. This was further corroborated by a decreased postsynaptic responsiveness to local puffs of the GABAA receptor agonist isoguvacine. The Abeta-induced IPSC decline could be prevented with intracellular applications of p4, a blocker of GABA(A) receptor internalization. It is concluded that Abeta weakens synaptic inhibition via downregulation of GABA(A) receptors.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The ability to identify individuals at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) may streamline biomarker and drug trials and aid clinical and personal decision making. METHODS: We evaluated the discriminative ability of a genetic risk score (GRS) covering 22 published genetic risk loci for AD in 1162 Flanders-Belgian AD patients and 1019 controls and assessed correlations with family history, onset age, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (Abeta1-42, T-Tau, P-Tau181P). RESULTS: A GRS including all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and age-specific APOE epsilon4 weights reached area under the curve (AUC) 0.70, which increased to AUC 0.78 for patients with familial predisposition. Risk of AD increased with GRS (odds ratio, 2.32 (95% confidence interval 2.08-2.58 per unit; P < 1.0e(-15)). Onset age and CSF Abeta1-42 decreased with increasing GRS (Ponset_age = 9.0e(-11); PAbeta = 8.9e(-7)). DISCUSSION: The discriminative ability of this 22-SNP GRS is still limited, but these data illustrate that incorporation of age-specific weights improves discriminative ability. GRS-phenotype correlations highlight the feasibility of identifying individuals at highest susceptibility.",

    "title": "Calcium flux-independent NMDA receptor activity is required for Abeta oligomer-induced synaptic loss.",
    "abstract": "Synaptic loss is one of the major features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and correlates with the degree of dementia. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) have been shown to mediate downstream effects of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in AD models. NMDARs can trigger intracellular cascades via Ca(2+) entry, however, also Ca(2+)-independent (metabotropic) functions of NMDARs have been described. We aimed to determine whether ionotropic or metabotropic NMDAR signaling is required for the induction of synaptic loss by Abeta. We show that endogenous Abeta as well as exogenously added synthetic Abeta oligomers induced dendritic spine loss and reductions in pre- and postsynaptic protein levels in hippocampal slice cultures. Synaptic alterations were mitigated by blocking glutamate binding to NMDARs using NMDAR antagonist APV, but not by preventing ion flux with Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA or open-channel blockers MK-801 or memantine. Abeta increased the activity of p38 MAPK, a kinase involved in long-term depression and inhibition of p38 MAPK abolished the loss of dendritic spines. Abeta-induced increase of p38 MAPK activity was prevented by APV but not by BAPTA, MK-801 or memantine treatment highlighting the role of glutamate binding to NMDARs but not Ca(2+) flux for synaptic degeneration by Abeta. We further show that treatment with the G protein inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX) did not prevent dendritic spine loss in the presence of Abeta oligomers. Our data suggest that Abeta induces the activation of p38 MAPK and subsequent synaptic loss through Ca(2+) flux- and G protein-independent mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid fiber formation is a key event in many misfolding disorders. The ability to monitor the kinetics of fiber formation and other prefibrillar assemblies is therefore crucial for understanding these diseases. Here we compare three fluorescent probes for their ability to monitor fiber formation, ANS (1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid) and bis-ANS (4,4'-dianilino-1,1'-binaphthyl-5,5'-disulfonic acid) along with the more widely used thioflavin T (ThT). For this, we have used two highly amyloidogenic peptides: amyloid-beta (Abeta) from Alzheimer's disease and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) associated with type II diabetes. Using a well-plate reader, we show all three fluorophores can report the kinetics of fiber formation. Indeed, bis-ANS is markedly more sensitive to fiber detection than ThT and has a submicromolar affinity for Abeta fibers. Furthermore, we show that fluorescence detection is very sensitive to the presence of excess fluorophore. In particular, beyond a 1:1 stoichiometry these probes demonstrate marked fluorescence quenching, for both Abeta and IAPP. Indeed, the fiber-associated fluorescence signal is almost completely quenched in the presence of excess ThT. There is also intense interest in the detection of prefibrillar amyloid assemblies, as oligomers and protofibrils are believed to be highly cytotoxic. We generate stable, fiber-free, prefibrillar assemblies of Abeta and survey their fluorescence with ANS and bis-ANS. Fluorescence from ANS has often been used as a marker for oligomers; however, we show ANS can fluoresce more strongly in the presence of fibers and should therefore be used as a probe for oligomers with caution.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Indigenous populations may be at increased risk, compared with majority populations, for the development of dementia due to lower education levels and socio-economic status, higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and alcohol abuse, an aging population structure, and poorer overall health. This is the first systematic review investigating the prevalence and incidence of dementia in indigenous populations worldwide. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycInfo for relevant papers published up to April 2015. Studies were included if they reported prevalence or incidence, the disease typically occurred after the age of 45, the study population included indigenous people, and the study was conducted in the general population. RESULTS: Fifteen studies representing five countries (Canada, Australia, the USA, Guam, Brazil) met the inclusion criteria. Dementia prevalence ranged from 0.5% to 20%. Retrospective studies relying on medical records for diagnoses had much lower prevalence rates and a higher risk of bias than population-based prospective studies performing their own diagnoses with culturally appropriate cognitive assessment methods. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of dementia among indigenous populations appears to be higher than it is for non-indigenous populations. Despite a building body of evidence supporting the need for dementia research among indigenous populations, there is a paucity of epidemiological research, none of which is of high quality.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and characterized by deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein and smooth muscle cell (SMC) death in cerebral vessel walls. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is of importance in both Abeta accumulation and Abeta-mediated toxicity towards SMCs in the cerebral vessel wall, although its exact role in CAA pathogenesis remains unclear. Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is an enzyme capable of inducing both protein complexes and altered protein bioactivity via post-translational cross-linking. In CAA, tTG and its catalytic activity are associated with deposited Abeta. Furthermore, several apolipoproteins are known substrates of tTG. We therefore investigated whether ApoE is a substrate for tTG and if this affects ApoE's bioactivity. We found strong binding of different ApoE isoforms with tTG and demonstrated tTG-catalysed ApoE multimers. In post-mortem human AD cases, ApoE colocalized with in situ active tTG in CAA. Moreover, human brain SMCs treated with Abeta demonstrated enhanced secretion of both ApoE and tTG, and of TG cross-links in the extracellular matrix. Interestingly, tTG-catalysed cross-linked ApoE failed to protect SMCs against Abeta-mediated cytotoxicity. Together, our data demonstrate a novel tTG-driven post-translational modification of ApoE that might play an important role in CAA. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein deposition and cerebral smooth muscle cell (SMC) death. We found that, in contrast to normal vessels, in CAA apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is cross-linked by tissue transglutaminase (tTG) resulting in stable ApoE complexes. These complexes no longer protect cerebral SMC from Abeta-mediated toxicity. Our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism explaining the Abeta-mediated cerebral SMC cell death characteristic of CAA in AD cases.",

Studies have shown the beneficial effects of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha) agonists on the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases. The aim of the present study is to examine the ability of GW7647 (a PPAR-alpha agonist) to regulate amyloid precursor protein (APP) amyloidogenic processing in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells transfected with APPswe gene. After administration of GW7647 for 24 h, the levels of APP, soluble APPbeta (sAPPbeta), and presenilin 1 (PS-1) were assessed by Western blot. Cellular culture medium levels of amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42) were analyzed by ELISA, and the activity of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) was measured by fluorometric assay. We found that GW7647 decreased the expression of sAPPbeta and the activity of BACE-1, and also reduced Abeta42 release. However, GW7647 did not modify the levels of APP and PS-1. Furthermore, LY294002, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor, reversed the effects of GW7647 on the BACE-1 activity and the levels of sAPPbeta and Abeta42. Our data demonstrate that GW7647 may reduce Abeta production via inhibiting BACE-1 activity, and this may involve in PI3-K pathway.",

    "abstract": "Cholesterol is essential for maintaining lipid raft integrity and has been regarded as a crucial regulatory factor for amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The vast majority of studies on amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism and amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) production have focused on neurons. The role of astrocytes remains largely unexplored, despite the presence of activated astrocytes in the brains of most patients with AD and in transgenic models of the disease. The role of cholesterol in Abeta production has been thoroughly studied in neurons and attributed to the participation of lipid rafts in APP metabolism. Thus, in this study, we analyzed the effect of cholesterol loading in astrocytes and analyzed the expression and processing of APP. We found that cholesterol exposure induced astrocyte activation, increased APP content, and enhanced the interaction of APP with BACE-1. These effects were associated with an enrichment of ganglioside GM1-cholesterol patches in the astrocyte membrane and with increased ROS production. GLIA 2015;63:2010-2022.",

Nonfibrillar Abeta aggregates have been considered as an important intermediate in the pathway of fibrillization, but little is known about the formation mechanism. The on-pathway beta-sheet intermediates of Abeta40 peptides can be trapped by incubating the peptides in liposomes formed by zwitterionic lipids. The aggregates of Abeta40 peptides have been prepared at a peptide concentration of less than 10 mum. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy data show that the backbone conformation of the aggregates is almost identical to that of the fibrils formed in free solution. In contrast to anionic lipids, zwitterionic lipids, which are typical of neuronal soma, did not induce any significant conformational difference in Abeta40 fibrils. This liposome-Abeta system may serve as a useful model to study the fibril formation mechanism.",

OBJECTIVE: To define the scope and needs of computational pathology. DATA SOURCES: A meeting was convened in Boston, Massachusetts, in July 2014 prior to the annual Association of Pathology Chairs meeting, and it was attended by a variety of pathologists, including individuals highly invested in pathology informatics as well as chairs of pathology departments. CONCLUSIONS: The meeting made recommendations to promote computational pathology, including clearly defining the field and articulating its value propositions; asserting that the value propositions for health care systems must include means to incorporate robust computational approaches to implement data-driven methods that aid in guiding individual and population health care; leveraging computational pathology as a center for data interpretation in modern health care systems; stating that realizing the value proposition will require working with institutional administrations, other departments, and pathology colleagues; declaring that a robust pipeline should be fostered that trains and develops future computational pathologists, for those with both pathology and nonpathology backgrounds; and deciding that computational pathology should serve as a hub for data-related research in health care systems. The dissemination of these recommendations to pathology and bioinformatics departments should help facilitate the development of computational pathology.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn)-rich Lewy bodies are the major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease, respectively. An overlap of pathologies is found in most individuals with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and in more than 50% of AD cases. Their brains display substantial alpha-syn accumulation not only in Lewy bodies, but also in dystrophic neurites decorating Abeta plaques. Several studies report binding and coaggregation of Abeta and alpha-syn, yet the precise role of alpha-syn in amyloid plaque formation remains elusive. Here we performed intracerebral injections of alpha-syn-containing preparations into amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice (expressing APP695(KM670/671NL) and PSEN1(L166P) under the control of the neuron-specific Thy-1 promoter; referred to here as 'APPPS1'). Unexpectedly, alpha-syn failed to cross-seed Abeta plaques in vivo, but rather it inhibited plaque formation in APPPS1 mice coexpressing SNCA(A30P) (referred to here as 'APPPS1 x [A30P]aSYN' double-transgenic mice). This was accompanied by increased Abeta levels in cerebrospinal fluid despite unchanged overall Abeta levels. Notably, the seeding activity of Abeta-containing brain homogenates was considerably reduced by alpha-syn, and Abeta deposition was suppressed in grafted tissue from [A30P]aSYN transgenic mice. Thus, we conclude that an interaction between Abeta and alpha-syn leads to inhibition of Abeta deposition and to reduced plaque formation.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes dementia, affects millions of elderly Americans and represents a growing problem with the aging of the population. There has been an increasing effort for improved and earlier diagnosis for AD. Several newly developed radiolabeled compounds targeting beta-amyloid plaques, one of the major pathologic biomarkers of AD, have recently become available for clinical use. These radiopharmaceuticals allow for in vivo noninvasive visualization of abnormal beta-amyloid deposits in the brain using positron emission tomography (PET). Amyloid PET imaging has demonstrated high sensitivity for pathologic cerebral amyloid deposition in multiple studies. Principal drawbacks to this new diagnostic test are declining specificity in older age groups and uncertain clinical role given lack of disease-modifying therapy for AD. Although there is strong evidence for the utility of amyloid PET in certain situations, detailed in a set of guidelines for appropriate use from the Alzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, the question of overdiagnosis, the diagnosis of a disease that would result in neither symptoms nor deaths, using this new medical tool needs to be carefully considered in light of efforts to secure reimbursement for the new technology that is already widely available for use as a clinical tool.",

The molecular basis of this biological process is still unknown and there is a strong need of developing effective strategies to control the occurring events. To this purpose the exploitation of small molecules interacting with Abeta aggregation represents one of the possible routes. Moreover, the use specific labeling has represented so far one of the most common and effective methods to investigate such a process. This possibility in turn rests on the reliability of the probe/labels involved. Here we present evidences of the effect of Thioflavin T (ThT), a worldwide used fluorescent dye to monitor amyloid growth, on the Abeta(1-40) conformation, stability and aggregation. By combining experimental information and Molecular Dynamics simulation results, we show that the presence of ThT in solution affects peptide conformation inducing peculiar supramolecular association. In particular ThT interactions with specific Abeta(1-40) residues promote a rigid partially-folded conformation which shifts the balance between different species in solution toward a more aggregation-prone ensemble of peptides, leading to aggregation. Our findings suggest ways for developing strategies to reverse and block aggregation or to stimulate supramolecular assembly and consequently reduce the presence of transient oligomers. This investigation underlines the need of developing label-free techniques for unbiased quantitative studies of Abeta(1-40) aggregation processes.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To detect rare coding variants underlying loci detected by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of late onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD). METHODS: We conducted targeted sequencing of ABCA7, BIN1, CD2AP, CLU, CR1, EPHA1, MS4A4A/MS4A6A, and PICALM in 3 independent LOAD cohorts: 176 patients from 124 Caribbean Hispanics families, 120 patients and 33 unaffected individuals from the 129 National Institute on Aging LOAD Family Study; and 263 unrelated Canadian individuals of European ancestry (210 sporadic patients and 53 controls). Rare coding variants found in at least 2 data sets were genotyped in independent groups of ancestry-matched controls. Additionally, the Exome Aggregation Consortium was used as a reference data set for population-based allele frequencies. RESULTS: Overall we detected a statistically significant 3.1-fold enrichment of the nonsynonymous mutations in the Caucasian LOAD cases compared with controls (p = 0.002) and no difference in synonymous variants. A stop-gain mutation in ABCA7 (E1679X) and missense mutation in CD2AP (K633R) were highly significant in Caucasian LOAD cases, and mutations in EPHA1 (P460L) and BIN1 (K358R) were significant in Caribbean Hispanic families with LOAD. The EPHA1 variant segregated completely in an extended Caribbean Hispanic family and was also nominally significant in the Caucasians. Additionally, BIN1 (K358R) segregated in 2 of the 6 Caribbean Hispanic families where the mutations were discovered. INTERPRETATION: Targeted sequencing of confirmed GWAS loci revealed an excess burden of deleterious coding mutations in LOAD, with the greatest burden observed in ABCA7 and BIN1. Identifying coding variants in LOAD will facilitate the creation of tractable models for investigation of disease-related mechanisms and potential therapies.",

By employing microdialysis technique, we report local increase in the amyloid-beta42 levels and elevated amyloid-beta42/40 ratio in the interstitial fluid within 6h of direct infusion of oxidizing agents into the hippocampus of living and awake wild type mice. The increase in the amyloid-beta42/40 ratio correlated with the pathogenic conformational change of the amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme, presenilin1/gamma-secretase. Furthermore, we found that the product of lipid peroxidation 4-hydroxynonenal, binds to both nicastrin and BACE, differentially affecting gamma- and beta-secretase activity, respectively. The present study demonstrates a direct cause-and-effect correlation between oxidative stress and altered amyloid-beta production, and provides a molecular mechanism by which naturally occurring product of lipid peroxidation may trigger generation of toxic amyloid-beta42 species.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. This disease is a progressive and irreversible brain disorder accompanied with severe learning and memory impairment. This study investigated whether treatment with standardized Lycii Fructus Extract (LFE) would improve the cognitive function and the pathological features of AD in 3xTg-AD mice. ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Lycii Fructus is a fruit of Lycium chinense Miller and widely distributed in East Asia and has been used traditionally for anti-aging purposes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cognitive function of 3xTg-AD mice was assessed using the Morris water maze test. The levels of the amyloid beta deposits and NeuN in the hippocampus were evaluated with immunohistochemistry. Brain neurotrophic derived factor (BDNF) and tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) expressions were examined by western blot analysis. RESULTS: LFE treatment significantly ameliorated learning and memory deficits in AD mice, as shown by increased time spent in the target zone during probe tests. In addition, LFE significantly decreased Abeta deposits, increased NeuN-positive cells, and upregulated the expression of BDNF and TrkB in the 3xTg AD mice. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that LFE treatment can be a useful strategy for treating memory impairment induced by several neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Kisspeptin (KP), the endogenous ligand of GPR54, is a recently discovered neuropeptide shown to be involved in regulating reproductive system, anxiety-related behavior, locomotion, food intake, and suppression of metastasis across a range of cancers. KP is transcribed within the hippocampus, and GPR54 has been found in the amygdala and hippocampus, suggesting that KP might be involved in mediating learning and memory. However, the role of KP in cognition was largely unclear. Here, we investigated the role of KP-13, one of the endogenous active isoforms, in memory processes, and determined whether KP-13 could mitigate memory impairment induced by Abeta1-42 in mice, using novel object recognition (NOR) and object location recognition (OLR) tasks. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of KP-13 (2mug) immediately after training not only facilitated memory formation, but also prolonged memory retention in both tasks. The memory-improving effects of KP-13 could be blocked by the GPR54 receptor antagonist, kisspeptin-234 (234), and GnRH receptors antagonist, Cetrorelix, suggesting pharmacological specificity. Then the memory-enhancing effects were also presented after infusion of KP-13 into the hippocampus. Moreover, we found that i.c.v. injection of KP-13 was able to reverse the memory impairment induced by Abeta1-42, which was inhibited by 234. To sum up, the results of our work indicate that KP-13 could facilitate memory formation and prolong memory retention through activation of the GPR54 and GnRH receptors, and suppress memory-impairing effect of Abeta1-42 through activation of the GPR54, suggesting that KP-13 may be a potential drug for enhancing memory and treating Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Esculentoside A (EsA) is a saponin isolated from the roots of Phytolacca esculenta. Previous studies have demonstrated that EsA exerts strong anti-inflammatory effects in peripheral immune inflammation. This study is to determine whether EsA is effective in inflammation-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Male C57BL/6(B6) mice were divided into three groups of six mice as follows: (1) control group; (2) AD model group (Abeta(1-42)-induced AD mice with saline); (3) EsA group (Abeta(1-42)-induced AD mice with EsA, 5  mg/kg/day, i.p. for 15 days). Behavioural testing was performed after 15  days of EsA treatment. Real time PCR and Western blot were used to assess the level of inflammation factors and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Immunostaining was used to determine the level of activated microglia and astrocyte. RESULTS: The results showed that EsA attenuated memory deficits in Abeta(1-42)-induced AD mice. Esculentoside A decreased the pro-inflammatory factors and microglia and astrocyte activation in the hippocampi of Abeta(1-42)-induced AD mice. Moreover, Abeta(1-42) activated phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAPKs in the hippocampi of mice in the AD model group, while EsA significantly decreased the phosphorylation levels. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that EsA provides protective effects against neuroinflammation triggered by beta-amyloid.",

    "title": "Age-related increases in amyloid beta and membrane attack complex: evidence of inflammasome activation in the rodent eye.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The membrane attack complex (MAC) is a key player in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and is a putative activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Amyloid beta (Abeta), a component of drusen deposits, has also been implicated in inflammasome activation by our work and those of others. However, the interactions of MAC and Abeta are still poorly understood, especially their roles in aging and retinal degenerative pathologies. Since inflammasome activation may represent a key cellular pathway underlying age-related chronic inflammation in the eye, the purpose of this study is to identify the effects associated with MAC and inflammasome activation in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid and to evaluate the therapeutic merits of MAC suppression. METHODS: Adult Long-Evans rats were divided into treatment and control groups. Treatment groups received oral aurin tricarboxylic acid complex (ATAC), a MAC inhibitor, in drinking-water, and control groups received drinking-water alone (No ATAC). Groups were sacrificed at 7.5 or 11.5 months, after approximately 40 days of ATAC treatment. To study age-related changes of Abeta and MAC in RPE/choroid, naive animals were sacrificed at 2.5, 7.5, and 11.5 months. Eye tissues underwent immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis for MAC, Abeta, NF-kappaB activation, as well as cleaved caspase-1 and IL-18. Vitreal samples were collected and assessed by multiplex assays for secreted levels of IL-18 and IL-1beta. Statistical analyses were performed, and significance level was set at p <= 0.05. RESULTS: In vivo studies demonstrated an age-dependent increase in MAC, Abeta, and NF-kappaB activation in the RPE/choroid. Systemic ATAC resulted in a prominent reduction in MAC formation and a concomitant reduction in inflammasome activation measured by cleaved caspase-1 and secreted levels of IL-18 and IL-1beta, but not in NF-kappaB activation. In vitro studies demonstrated Abeta-induced MAC formation on RPE cells. CONCLUSIONS: Age-dependent increases in Abeta and MAC are present in the rodent outer retina. Our results suggest that suppressing MAC formation and subsequent inflammasome activation in the RPE/choroid may reduce chronic low-grade inflammation associated with IL-18 and IL-1beta in the outer retina.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with type II diabetes (T2D) and obesity in several epidemiologic studies. To determine whether AD neuropathology can cause peripheral metabolic impairments, we investigated metabolic parameters in the triple-transgenic (3xTg)-AD mouse model of AD, compared with those in nontransgenic (non-Tg) controls, at 6, 8, and 14 mo of age. We found a more pronounced cortical Abeta accumulation (2- and 3.5-fold increase in Abeta42 in the soluble and insoluble protein fractions, respectively) in female 3xTg-AD mice than in the males. Furthermore, female 3xTg-AD mice displayed a significant deterioration in glucose tolerance (AUC, +118% vs. non-Tg mice at 14 mo). Fasting plasma insulin levels rose 2.5-fold from 6 to 14 mo of age in female 3xTg-AD mice. Glucose intolerance and cortical amyloid pathology worsened with age, and both were more pronounced in the females. Pancreatic amyloidopathy was revealed and could underlie the observed deficit in glycemic response in 3xTg-AD mice. The present results suggest that AD-like neuropathology extends to the pancreas in the 3xTg-AD mouse, leading to glucose intolerance and contributing to a pathologic self-amplifying loop between AD and T2D.",

    "abstract": "Mast cells (MCs) store an array of proinflammatory mediators in secretory granules that are rapidly released upon activation by diverse conditions including amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides. In the present work, we found a rapid degranulation of cultured MCs through a pannexin1 hemichannel (Panx1 HC)-dependent mechanism induced by Abeta25-35 peptide. Accordingly, Abeta25-35 peptide also increased membrane current and permeability, as well as intracellular Ca(2+) signal, mainly via Panx1 HCs because all of these responses were drastically inhibited by Panx1 HC blockers and absent in the MCs of Panx1(-/-) mice. Moreover, in acute coronal brain slices of control mice, Abeta25-35 peptide promoted both connexin 43 (Cx43)- and Panx1 HC-dependent MC dye uptake and histamine release, responses that were only Cx43 HC dependent in Panx1(-/-) mice. Because MCs have been found close to amyloid plaques of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), their distribution in brain slices of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, a murine model of AD, was also investigated. The number of MCs in hippocampal and cortical areas increased drastically even before amyloid plaque deposits became evident. Therefore, MCs might act as early sensors of amyloid peptide and recruit other cells to the neuroinflammatory response, thus playing a critical role in the onset and progression of AD.",

    "title": "Identifying in vivo DCE MRI markers associated with microvessel architecture and gleason grades of prostate cancer.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To identify computer extracted in vivo dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI markers associated with quantitative histomorphometric (QH) characteristics of microvessels and Gleason scores (GS) in prostate cancer. METHODS: This study considered retrospective data from 23 biopsy confirmed prostate cancer patients who underwent 3 Tesla multiparametric MRI before radical prostatectomy (RP). Representative slices from RP specimens were stained with vascular marker CD31. Tumor extent was mapped from RP sections onto DCE MRI using nonlinear registration methods. Seventy-seven microvessel QH features and 18 DCE MRI kinetic features were extracted and evaluated for their ability to distinguish low from intermediate and high GS. The effect of temporal sampling on kinetic features was assessed and correlations between those robust to temporal resolution and microvessel features discriminative of GS were examined. RESULTS: A total of 12 microvessel architectural features were discriminative of low and intermediate/high grade tumors with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) > 0.7. These features were most highly correlated with mean washout gradient (WG) (max rho = -0.62). Independent analysis revealed WG to be moderately robust to temporal resolution (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.63) and WG variance, which was poorly correlated with microvessel features, to be predictive of low grade tumors (AUC = 0.77). Enhancement ratio was the most robust (ICC = 0.96) and discriminative (AUC = 0.78) kinetic feature but was moderately correlated with microvessel features (max rho = -0.52). CONCLUSION: Computer extracted features of prostate DCE MRI appear to be correlated with microvessel architecture and may be discriminative of low versus intermediate and high GS.",

    "abstract": "One of the most common pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain is the large number of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides accumulating in lesion areas. Ginsenosides are the most active components extracted from ginseng. Ginsenoside Rd (GRd) is a newly discovered saponin that has a stronger pharmacological activity than other ginsenosides, especially in neuroprotection. Here we examined the neuroprotective effects of GRd against neuronal insults induced by Abeta25-35 in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. A 10muM GRd treatment significantly prevented the loss of hippocampal neurons induced by Abeta25-35. In addition, GRd significantly ameliorated Abeta25-35-induced oxidative stress by decreasing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and increasing the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px); which is similar in treatments with 10muM of probucol (PB) and 100muM of edaravone (EDA). Moreover, our present study demonstrated that GRd significantly enhanced the expression of Bcl-2 mRNA, and decreased the expressions of Bax mRNA and Cyt c mRNA. GRd also downregulated the protein level of cleaved Caspase-3 compared to controls. These results highlighted the neuroprotective effects of GRd against Abeta25-35-induced oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis, suggesting that this may be a promising therapeutics against AD.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide mediates several neurodegenerative diseases. The 42 amino acid (Abeta1-42) is the predominant form of peptide found in the neuritic plaques and has been demonstrated to be neurotoxic in vivo and in vitro. The availability of large quantities of Abeta peptide will help in several biochemical and biophysical studies that may help in exploring the aggregation mechanism and toxicity of Abeta peptide. We report a convenient and economical method to obtain such a peptide biologically. Synthetic oligonucleotides encoding Abeta1-42 were constructed and amplified through the polymerase cycling assembly (also known as assembly PCR), followed by the amplification PCR. Abeta1-42 gene was cloned into pET41a(+) vector for expression. Interestingly, the addition of 3% (v/v) ethanol to the culture medium resulted in the production of large amounts of soluble Abeta fusion protein. The Abeta fusion protein was subjected to a Ni-NTA affinity chromatography followed by enterokinase digestion, and the Abeta peptide was purified using glutathione Sepharose affinity chromatography. The peptide yield was ~15mg/L culture, indicating the utility of this method for high-yield production of soluble Abeta peptide. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and immunoblotting with anti-His antibody confirmed the identity of purified Abeta fusion protein and Abeta peptide. In addition, this method provides an advantage over the chemical synthesis and other conventional methods used for large-scale production of recombinant Abeta peptide.",

    "title": "The Distinct Role of ADAM17 in APP Proteolysis and Microglial Activation Related to Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with the symptom of cognitive impairment. The deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide is believed to be the primary cause to neuronal dystrophy and eventually dementia. Abeta is the proteolytic product from its precursor amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma- secretase. An optional cleavage by alpha-secretase happens inside the Abeta domain. ADAM17 is supposed to be the regulated alpha-secretase of APP. Enhanced activity of ADAM17 leads to the increasing secretion of neuroprotective soluble APP alpha fragment and reduction of Abeta generation, which may be benefit to the disease. ADAM17 is then considered the potential therapeutic target for AD. Microglia activation and neuroinflammation is another important event in AD pathogenesis. Interestingly, ADAM17 also participates in the cleavage of many other membrane-bound proteins, especially some inflammatory factors related to microglia activation. The facilitating role of ADAM17 in inflammation and further neuronal damage has also been illustrated. In results, the activation of ADAM17 as the solution to AD may be a tricky task. The comprehensive consideration and evaluation has to be carried out carefully before the final treatment. In the present review, the distinct role of ADAM17 in AD-related APP shedding and neuroinflammatory microglial activation will be carefully discussed.",

OBJECTIVE: To characterize and compare structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), resting-state and task-dependent functional MRI, and plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) measurements in presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A mutation-carrying and noncarrying children with ADAD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional measures of structural and functional MRI and plasma Abeta assays were assessed in 18 PSEN1 E280A carriers and 19 noncarriers aged 9 to 17 years from a Colombian kindred with ADAD. Recruitment and data collection for this study were conducted at the University of Antioquia and the Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe in Medellin, Colombia, between August 2011 and June 2012. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All participants had blood sampling, structural MRI, and functional MRI during associative memory encoding and resting-state and cognitive assessments. Outcome measures included plasma Abeta1-42 concentrations and Abeta1-42:Abeta1-40 ratios, memory encoding-dependent activation changes, resting-state connectivity, and regional gray matter volumes. Structural and functional MRI data were compared using automated brain mapping algorithms and search regions related to AD. RESULTS: Similar to findings in adult mutation carriers, in the later preclinical and clinical stages of ADAD, mutation-carrying children were distinguished from control individuals by significantly higher plasma Abeta1-42 levels (mean [SD]: carriers, 18.8 [5.1] pg/mL and noncarriers, 13.1 [3.2] pg/mL; P < .001) and Abeta1-42:Abeta1-40 ratios (mean [SD]: carriers, 0.32 [0.06] and noncarriers, 0.21 [0.03]; P < .001), as well as less memory encoding task-related deactivation in parietal regions (eg, mean [SD] parameter estimates for the right precuneus were -0.590 [0.50] for noncarriers and -0.087 [0.38] for carriers; P < .005 uncorrected). Unlike carriers in the later stages, mutation-carrying children demonstrated increased functional connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex with medial temporal lobe regions (mean [SD] parameter estimates were 0.038 [0.070] for noncarriers and 0.190 [0.057] for carriers), as well as greater gray matter volumes in temporal regions (eg, left parahippocampus; P < . 049, corrected for multiple comparisons). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Children at genetic risk for ADAD have functional and structural brain changes and abnormal levels of plasma Abeta1-42. The extent to which the underlying brain changes are either neurodegenerative or developmental remains to be determined. This study provides additional information about the earliest known biomarker changes associated with ADAD.",

    "abstract": "This article is part of a Special Issue \"SBN 2014\". Hormonal changes associated with ageing have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Reductions in serum testosterone and increases in luteinizing hormone (LH) are established AD risk factors for dementia in men and have important roles in modulating AD pathogenesis. One of the defining features of AD is the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain, which has a key role in the neurodegenerative cascade. Both testosterone and LH have been shown to modulate CNS Abeta accumulation in animal studies, and associations with cerebral amyloid load in human studies have supported this. The underlying mechanisms by which these hormones modulate Abeta accumulation and contribute to neurodegeneration are not completely understood, however they have been shown to regulate Abeta metabolism, enhance its clearance and alter the processing of its parent molecule, the amyloid precursor protein. This review will discuss underlying mechanisms by which testosterone and LH modulate Abeta and provide an update on therapeutic approaches targeting these hormones.",

    "title": "Melatonin regulates the transcription of betaAPP-cleaving secretases mediated through melatonin receptors in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.",
    "abstract": "Melatonin is involved in the control of various physiological functions, such as sleep, cell growth and free radical scavenging. The ability of melatonin to behave as an antioxidant, together with the fact that the Alzheimer-related amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) triggers oxidative stress through hydroxyl radical-induced cell death, suggests that melatonin could reduce Alzheimer's pathology. Although the exact etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains to be established, excess Abeta is believed to be the primary contributor to the dysfunction and degeneration of neurons that occurs in AD. Abeta peptides are produced via the sequential cleavage of beta-secretase beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and gamma-secretase (PS1/PS2), while alpha-secretase (ADAM10) prevents the production of Abeta peptides. We hypothesized that melatonin could inhibit BACE1 and PS1/PS2 and enhance ADAM10 expression. Using the human neuronal SH-SY5Y cell line, we found that melatonin inhibited BACE1 and PS1 and activated ADAM10 mRNA level and protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner and mediated via melatonin G protein-coupled receptors. Melatonin inhibits BACE1 and PS1 protein expressions through the attenuation of nuclear factor-kappaB phosphorylation (pNF-kappaB). Moreover, melatonin reduced BACE1 promoter transactivation and consequently downregulated beta-secretase catalytic activity. The present data show that melatonin is not only a potential regulator of beta/gamma-secretase but also an activator of alpha-secretase expression through the activation of protein kinase C, thereby favoring the nonamyloidogenic pathway over the amyloidogenic pathway. Altogether, our findings suggest that melatonin may be a potential therapeutic agent for reducing the risk of AD in humans.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in synaptic mitochondria is associated with mitochondrial and synaptic injury. The underlying mechanisms and strategies to eliminate Abeta and rescue mitochondrial and synaptic defects remain elusive. Presequence protease (PreP), a mitochondrial peptidasome, is a novel mitochondrial Abeta degrading enzyme. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that increased expression of active human PreP in cortical neurons attenuates Alzheimer disease's (AD)-like mitochondrial amyloid pathology and synaptic mitochondrial dysfunction, and suppresses mitochondrial oxidative stress. Notably, PreP-overexpressed AD mice show significant reduction in the production of proinflammatory mediators. Accordingly, increased neuronal PreP expression improves learning and memory and synaptic function in vivo AD mice, and alleviates Abeta-mediated reduction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Our results provide in vivo evidence that PreP may play an important role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function by clearance and degradation of mitochondrial Abeta along with the improvement in synaptic and behavioral function in AD mouse model. Thus, enhancing PreP activity/expression may be a new therapeutic avenue for treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "The main hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates in the brain. An early diagnosis of the disease requires a fast and accurate detection of such aggregates in vivo. NIAD-4 is one of the most promising in vivo markers developed due to its high emission at lambda > 600 nm and its ability to rapidly cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and target Abeta deposits. Furthermore, it shows a dramatic fluorescence enhancement upon binding to amyloid fibrils, which is essential for attaining good imaging contrast. Aiming at establishing novel design concepts for the preparation of optimized optical probes, the current work rationalizes the excellent performance of NIAD-4 by using a pool of computational (TD-DFT and CASPT2 calculations, ab initio molecular dynamics and protein energy landscape exploration) and spectroscopic techniques. Unlike other markers operating as molecular rotors or polarity-sensitive dyes, we uncover herein that the high fluorescence imaging contrast observed upon NIAD-4 binding to amyloid fibrils results from reversible aggregation. NIAD-4 forms non-emissive assemblies in aqueous solution already at very low concentrations, which convert into the highly fluorescent monomeric species by diffusion into the hydrophobic voids of Abeta deposits. This result paves the way to exploit aggregation-induced processes as a new strategy towards advanced fluorescence markers for amyloid detection.",

    "title": "Massive accumulation of luminal protease-deficient axonal lysosomes at Alzheimer's disease amyloid plaques.",
    "abstract": "Through a comprehensive analysis of organellar markers in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, we document a massive accumulation of lysosome-like organelles at amyloid plaques and establish that the majority of these organelles reside within swollen axons that contact the amyloid deposits. This close spatial relationship between axonal lysosome accumulation and extracellular amyloid aggregates was observed from the earliest stages of beta-amyloid deposition. Notably, we discovered that lysosomes that accumulate in such axons are lacking in multiple soluble luminal proteases and thus are predicted to be unable to efficiently degrade proteinaceous cargos. Of relevance to Alzheimer's disease, beta-secretase (BACE1), the protein that initiates amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein and which is a substrate for these proteases, builds up at these sites. Furthermore, through a comparison between the axonal lysosome accumulations at amyloid plaques and neuronal lysosomes of the wild-type brain, we identified a similar, naturally occurring population of lysosome-like organelles in neuronal processes that is also defined by its low luminal protease content. In conjunction with emerging evidence that the lysosomal maturation of endosomes and autophagosomes is coupled to their retrograde transport, our results suggest that extracellular beta-amyloid deposits cause a local impairment in the retrograde axonal transport of lysosome precursors, leading to their accumulation and a blockade in their further maturation. This study both advances understanding of Alzheimer's disease brain pathology and provides new insights into the subcellular organization of neuronal lysosomes that may have broader relevance to other neurodegenerative diseases with a lysosomal component to their pathology.",

There is controversy in the field over the question of which species of the aggregates, fibrils or protofibrils, are toxic. Moreover, compelling evidence suggested the exposure to heavy metals to be a risk of PD. Nevertheless, the mechanism of metal ions in promoting PD remains unclear. In this research, we investigated the structural basis of Cu(II) induced aggregation of alpha-synuclein. Using transmission electron microscopy experiments, Cu(II) was found to promote in vitro aggregation of alpha-synuclein by facilitating annular protofibril formation rather than fibril formation. Furthermore, neuroprotective baicalein disaggregated annular protofibrils accompanied by considerable decrease of beta-sheet content. These results strongly support the hypothesis that annular protofibrils are the toxic species, rather than fibrils, thereby inspiring us to search novel therapeutic strategies for the suppression of the toxic annular protofibril formation.",

METHODS: Fifty-one healthy controls (HCs), 72 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 90 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) from a European cohort were scanned with [11C]Pittsburgh compound-B (PIB) and compared with an age-, sex- and disease severity-matched population of 51 HC, 72 MCI and 84 AD patients from a North American cohort who were scanned with [18F]Florbetapir. An additional North American population of 246 HC, 342 MCI and 138 AD patients with a Florbetapir scan was split by age (55-75 vs 76-93 y) into groups matched for gender and disease severity. PET template-based analyses were used to quantify regional tracer uptake. RESULTS: The mean regional uptake patterns were similar and strong correlations were found between the two tracers across the regions of interest in HC (rho = 0.671, p = 0.02), amyloid-positive MCI (rho = 0.902, p < 0.001) and AD patients (rho = 0.853, p < 0.001). The application of the Florbetapir cut-off point resulted in a higher proportion of amyloid-positive HC and a lower proportion of amyloid-positive AD patients in the older group (28 and 30 %, respectively) than in the younger group (19 and 20 %, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results illustrate the comparability of Florbetapir and PIB in unrelated but matched patient populations. The role of amyloid PET imaging becomes increasingly important with increasing age in the diagnostic assessment of clinically impaired patients.",

    "abstract": "Amyloids are associated with diseases, including Alzheimer's, as well as functional roles such as storage of peptide hormones. It is still unclear what differences exist between aberrant and functional amyloids. However, it is known that soluble oligomers formed during amyloid aggregation are more toxic than the final fibrils. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to study the aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide Abeta25-35, associated with Alzheimer's disease, and two functional amyloid-forming tachykinin peptides: kassinin and neuromedin K. Although the three peptides have similar primary sequences, tachykinin peptides, in contrast to Abeta25-35, form nontoxic amyloids. Our simulations reveal that the charge of the C-terminus is essential to controlling the aggregation process. In particular, when the kassinin C-terminus is not amidated, the aggregation kinetics decreases considerably. In addition, we observe that the monomeric peptides in extended conformations aggregate faster than those in collapsed hairpin-like conformations.",

    "title": "Directional dominance on stature and cognition in diverse human populations.",
    "abstract": "Homozygosity has long been associated with rare, often devastating, Mendelian disorders, and Darwin was one of the first to recognize that inbreeding reduces evolutionary fitness. However, the effect of the more distant parental relatedness that is common in modern human populations is less well understood. Genomic data now allow us to investigate the effects of homozygosity on traits of public health importance by observing contiguous homozygous segments (runs of homozygosity), which are inferred to be homozygous along their complete length. Given the low levels of genome-wide homozygosity prevalent in most human populations, information is required on very large numbers of people to provide sufficient power. Here we use runs of homozygosity to study 16 health-related quantitative traits in 354,224 individuals from 102 cohorts, and find statistically significant associations between summed runs of homozygosity and four complex traits: height, forced expiratory lung volume in one second, general cognitive ability and educational attainment (P < 1 x 10(-300), 2.1 x 10(-6), 2.5 x 10(-10) and 1.8 x 10(-10), respectively). In each case, increased homozygosity was associated with decreased trait value, equivalent to the offspring of first cousins being 1.2 cm shorter and having 10 months' less education. Similar effect sizes were found across four continental groups and populations with different degrees of genome-wide homozygosity, providing evidence that homozygosity, rather than confounding, directly contributes to phenotypic variance. Contrary to earlier reports in substantially smaller samples, no evidence was seen of an influence of genome-wide homozygosity on blood pressure and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, or ten other cardio-metabolic traits. Since directional dominance is predicted for traits under directional evolutionary selection, this study provides evidence that increased stature and cognitive function have been positively selected in human evolution, whereas many important risk factors for late-onset complex diseases may not have been.",

    "title": "Harpagoside ameliorates the amyloid-beta-induced cognitive impairment in rats via up-regulating BDNF expression and MAPK/PI3K pathways.",
    "abstract": "So far, no effective disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) aiming at protecting or reversing neurodegeneration of the disease have been established yet. The present work aims to elucidate the effect of Harpagoside (abbreviated HAR), an iridoid glycosides purified from the Chinese medicinal herb Scrophularia ningpoensis, on neurodegeneration induced by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) and the underlying molecular mechanism. Here we show that HAR exerts neuroprotective effects against Abeta neurotoxicity. Rats injected aggregated Abeta1-40 into the bilateral hippocampus displayed impaired spatial learning and memory ability in a Y-maze test and novel object recognition test, while HAR treatment ameliorated Abeta1-40-induced behavioral deficits. Moreover, administration of HAR increased the expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activated the extracellular-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) pathways both in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the Abeta1-40-insulted rat model. Furthermore, in cultured primary cortical neurons, Abeta1-42 induced significant decrease of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neuron number and neurite outgrowth length, both of which were dose dependently increased by HAR. In addition, HAR pretreatment also significantly attenuated the decrease of cell viability in Abeta1-42-injured primary cortical neurons. Finally, when K252a, an inhibitor of Trk tyrosine kinases, and a BDNF neutralizing antibody were added to the culture medium 2 h prior to HAR addition, the protective effect of HAR on Abeta1-42-induced neurodegeneration in the primary cortical neuron was almost inhibited. Taken together, HAR exerting neuroprotection effect and ameliorating learning and memory deficit appears to be associated, at least in part, with up-regulation of BDNF content as well as activating its downstream signaling pathways, e.g., MAPK/PI3K pathways. It raises the possibility that HAR has potential to be a therapeutic agent against AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the misfolding and self-assembly of the amyloidogenic protein amyloid-beta (Abeta). The aggregation of Abeta leads to diverse oligomeric states, each of which may be potential targets for intervention. Obtaining insight into Abeta oligomers at the atomic level has been a major challenge to most techniques. Here, we use magic angle spinning recoupling (1)H-(1)H NMR experiments to overcome many of these limitations. Using (1)H-(1)H dipolar couplings as a NMR spectral filter to remove both high and low molecular weight species, we provide atomic-level characterization of a non-fibrillar aggregation product of the Abeta1-40 peptide using non-frozen samples without isotopic labeling. Importantly, this spectral filter allows the detection of the specific oligomer signal without a separate purification procedure. In comparison to other solid-state NMR techniques, the experiment is extraordinarily selective and sensitive. A resolved 2D spectra could be acquired of a small population of oligomers (6 micrograms, 7% of the total) amongst a much larger population of monomers and fibers (93% of the total). By coupling real-time (1)H-(1)H NMR experiments with other biophysical measurements, we show that a stable, primarily disordered Abeta1-40 oligomer 5-15 nm in diameter can form and coexist in parallel with the well-known cross-beta-sheet fibrils.",

    "abstract": "Delirium and dementia are two of the most common causes of cognitive impairment in older populations, yet their interrelation remains poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that dementia is the leading risk factor for delirium and that delirium is an independent risk factor for subsequent development of dementia. However, a major area of controversy is whether delirium is simply a marker of vulnerability to dementia, whether the effect of delirium is solely related to its precipitating factors, or whether delirium itself can cause permanent neuronal damage and lead to dementia. Ultimately, all of these hypotheses are likely to be true. Emerging evidence from epidemiological, clinicopathological, neuroimaging, biomarker, and experimental studies lends support to a strong relation between delirium and dementia, and to both shared and distinct pathological mechanisms. New preventive and therapeutic approaches that target delirium might offer a sought-after opportunity for early intervention, preservation of cognitive reserve, and prevention of irreversible cognitive decline in ageing.",

    "abstract": "Among putative downstream synaptic targets of beta-amyloid (Abeta) are signaling molecules involved in synaptic function, memory formation and cognition, such as the MAP kinases, MKPs, CaMKII, CREB, Fyn, and Tau. Here, we assessed the activation and interaction of signaling pathways upon prolonged exposure to Abeta in model nerve cells expressing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Our goal was to characterize the steps underlying sensitization of the nerve cells to neurotoxicity when Abeta-target receptors are present. Of particular focus was the connection of the activated signaling molecules to oxidative stress. Differentiated neuroblastoma cells expressing mouse alpha4beta2-nAChRs were exposed to Abeta1-42 for intervals from 30 min to 3 days. The cells and cell-derived protein extracts were then probed for activation of signaling pathway molecules (ERK, JNK, CaMKII, CREB, MARCKS, Fyn, tau). Our results show substantial, progressive activation of ERK in response to nanomolar Abeta exposure, starting at the earliest time point. Increased ERK activation was followed by JNK activation as well as an increased expression of PHF-tau, paralleled by increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The impact of prolonged Abeta on the levels of pERK, pJNK, and ROS was attenuated by MEK-selective and JNK-selective inhibitors. In addition, the MEK inhibitor as well as a JNK inhibitor attenuated Abeta-induced nuclear fragmentation, which followed the changes in ROS levels. These results demonstrate that the presence of nAChRs sensitizes neurons to the neurotoxic action of Abeta through the timed activation of discrete intracellular signaling molecules, suggesting pathways involved in the early stages of Alzheimer disease.",

    "title": "The behavioural/dysexecutive variant of Alzheimer's disease: clinical, neuroimaging and pathological features.",
    "abstract": "A 'frontal variant of Alzheimer's disease' has been described in patients with predominant behavioural or dysexecutive deficits caused by Alzheimer's disease pathology. The description of this rare Alzheimer's disease phenotype has been limited to case reports and small series, and many clinical, neuroimaging and neuropathological characteristics are not well understood. In this retrospective study, we included 55 patients with Alzheimer's disease with a behavioural-predominant presentation (behavioural Alzheimer's disease) and a neuropathological diagnosis of high-likelihood Alzheimer's disease (n = 17) and/or biomarker evidence of Alzheimer's disease pathology (n = 44). In addition, we included 29 patients with autopsy/biomarker-defined Alzheimer's disease with a dysexecutive-predominant syndrome (dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease). We performed structured chart reviews to ascertain clinical features. First symptoms were more often cognitive (behavioural Alzheimer's disease: 53%; dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease: 83%) than behavioural (behavioural Alzheimer's disease: 25%; dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease: 3%). Apathy was the most common behavioural feature, while hyperorality and perseverative/compulsive behaviours were less prevalent. Fifty-two per cent of patients with behavioural Alzheimer's disease met diagnostic criteria for possible behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia. Overlap between behavioural and dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease was modest (9/75 patients). Sixty per cent of patients with behavioural Alzheimer's disease and 40% of those with the dysexecutive syndrome carried at least one APOE epsilon4 allele. We also compared neuropsychological test performance and brain atrophy (applying voxel-based morphometry) with matched autopsy/biomarker-defined typical (amnestic-predominant) Alzheimer's disease (typical Alzheimer's disease, n = 58), autopsy-confirmed/Alzheimer's disease biomarker-negative behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (n = 59), and controls (n = 61). Patients with behavioural Alzheimer's disease showed worse memory scores than behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and did not differ from typical Alzheimer's disease, while executive function composite scores were lower compared to behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and typical Alzheimer's disease. Voxel-wise contrasts between behavioural and dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease patients and controls revealed marked atrophy in bilateral temporoparietal regions and only limited atrophy in the frontal cortex. In direct comparison with behavioural and those with dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease, patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia showed more frontal atrophy and less posterior involvement, whereas patients with typical Alzheimer's disease were slightly more affected posteriorly and showed less frontal atrophy (P < 0.001 uncorrected). Among 24 autopsied behavioural Alzheimer's disease/dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease patients, only two had primary co-morbid FTD-spectrum pathology (progressive supranuclear palsy). In conclusion, behavioural Alzheimer's disease presentations are characterized by a milder and more restricted behavioural profile than in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, co-occurrence of memory dysfunction and high APOE epsilon4 prevalence. Dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease presented as a primarily cognitive phenotype with minimal behavioural abnormalities and intermediate APOE epsilon4 prevalence. Both behavioural Alzheimer's disease and dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease presentations are distinguished by temporoparietal-predominant atrophy. Based on the relative sparing of frontal grey matter, we propose to redefine these clinical syndromes as 'the behavioural/dysexecutive variant of Alzheimer's disease' rather than frontal variant Alzheimer's disease. Further work is needed to determine whether behavioural and dysexecutive-predominant presentations of Alzheimer's disease represent distinct phenotypes or a single continuum.",

    "title": "Mutations in ABCA7 in a Belgian cohort of Alzheimer's disease patients: a targeted resequencing study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: ABCA7 was identified as a risk gene for Alzheimer's disease in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). It was one of the genes most strongly associated with risk of Alzheimer's disease in a Belgian cohort. Using targeted resequencing, we investigated ABCA7 in this cohort with the aim to directly detect rare and common variations in this gene associated with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. METHODS: We did massive parallel resequencing of ABCA7 after HaloPlex target enrichment of the exons, introns, and regulatory regions in 772 unrelated patients with Alzheimer's disease (mean age at onset 74 6 years [SD 8 9]) recruited at two memory clinics in Flanders, Belgium, and 757 geographically matched community-dwelling controls (mean age at inclusion 73 9 years [8 0]). After bioinformatic processing, common variants were analysed with conditional logistic regression and rare variant association analysis was done in Variant Association Tools. To explore an observed founder effect, additional unrelated patients with Alzheimer's disease (n=183, mean age at onset 78 8 years [SD 6 0]) and control individuals (n=265, mean age at inclusion 56 9 years [10 8]) from the same cohort who had not been included in massive parallel resequencing because of insufficient biosamples were screened for the ABCA7 frameshift mutation Glu709fs with Sanger sequencing. The effect of loss-of-function mutations on ABCA7 expression was investigated with quantitative real-time PCR in post-mortem brains of patients (n=3) and control individuals (n=4); nonsense mediated mRNA decay was investigated in lymphoblast cell lines from three predicted loss-of-function mutation carriers from the cohort of 772 patients with Alzheimer's disease. FINDINGS: An intronic low-frequency variant rs78117248 (minor allele frequency 3 8% in 58 patients with Alzheimer's disease and in controls 1 8% in 28 controls) showed strongest association with Alzheimer's disease (odds ratio 2 07, 95% CI 1 31-3 27; p=0 0016), and remained significant after conditioning for the GWAS top single nucleotide polymorphisms rs3764650, rs4147929, and rs3752246 (2 00, 1 22-3 26; p=0 006). We identified an increased frequency of predicted loss-of-function mutations in the patients compared with the controls (relative risk 4 03, 95% CI 1 75-9 29; p=0 0002). One frameshift mutation (Glu709fs) showed a founder effect in the study population, and was found to segregate with disease in a family with autosomal dominant inheritance of Alzheimer's disease. Expression of ABCA7 was reduced in the two carriers of loss-of-function mutations found only in patients with Alzheimer's disease (Glu709fs and Trp1214*) compared with four non-carrier controls (relative expression 0 45, 95% CI 0 25-0 84; p=0 002) and in lymphoblast cell lines from three carriers of Glu709fs compared with those from two non-carrier controls. INTERPRETATION: We propose that a low-frequency variant can explain the association between ABCA7 and Alzheimer's disease, and the evidence of loss-of-function mutations in this risk gene suggests that partial loss-of-function of ABCA7 could be a potential pathogenetic mechanism of Alzheimer's disease.

    "title": "Reduction of amyloid-beta levels in mouse eye tissues by intra-vitreally delivered neprilysin.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a group of aggregation-prone, 38- to 43-amino acid peptides generated in the eye and other organs. Numerous studies suggest that the excessive build-up of low-molecular-weight soluble oligomers of Abeta plays a role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease and other brain degenerative diseases. Recent studies raise the hypothesis that excessive Abeta levels may contribute also to certain retinal degenerative diseases. These findings, together with evidence that a major portion of Abeta is released as monomer into the extracellular space, raise the possibility that a technology enabling the enzymatic break-down of monomeric Abeta in the living eye under physiological conditions could prove useful for research on ocular Abeta physiology and, perhaps ultimately, for therapeutic applications. Neprilysin (NEP), an endopeptidase known to cleave Abeta monomer into inactive products, is a membrane-associated protein. However, sNEP, a recombinant form of the NEP catalytic domain, is soluble in aqueous medium. With the aim of determining the Abeta-cleaving activity of exogenous sNEP in the microenvironment of the intact eye, we analyzed the effect of intra-vitreally delivered sNEP on ocular Abeta levels in mice that exhibit readily measurable, aqueous buffer-extractable Abeta40 and Abeta42, two principal forms of Abeta. Anesthetized 10-month wild-type (C57BL/6J) and 2-3-month 5XFAD transgenic mice received intra-vitreal injections of sNEP (0.004-10 mug) in one eye and were sacrificed at defined post-treatment times (30 min - 12 weeks). Eye tissues (combined lens, vitreous, retina, RPE and choroid) were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed for Abeta40 and Abeta42 (ELISA) and for total protein (Bradford assay). The fellow, untreated eye of each mouse served as control, and concentrations of Abeta (pmol/g protein) in the treated eye were normalized to that of the untreated control eye. In C57BL/6J mice, as measured at 2 h after sNEP treatment, increasing amounts of injected sNEP yielded progressively greater reductions of Abeta40, ranging from 12% +- 3% (mean +- SEM; n = 3) with 4 ng sNEP to 85% +- 13% (n = 5) with 10 mug sNEP. At 4 ng sNEP the average Abeta40 reduction reached >70% by 24 h following treatment and remained near this level for about 8 weeks. In 5XFAD mice, 10 mug sNEP produced an Abeta40 decrease of 99% +- 1% (n = 4) and a substantial although smaller decrease in Abeta42 (42% +- 36%; n = 4) within 24 h. Electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded from eyes of C57BL/6J and 5XFAD mice at 9 days following treatment with 4 ng or 10 mug sNEP, conditions that on average led, respectively, to an 82% and 91% Abeta40 reduction in C57BL/6J eyes, an 87% and 92% Abeta40 reduction in 5XFAD eyes, and a 23% and 52% Abeta42 reduction in 5XFAD eyes. In all cases, sNEP-treated eyes exhibited robust ERG responses, consistent with a general tolerance of the posterior eye tissues to the investigated conditions of sNEP treatment. The sNEP-mediated decrease of ocular Abeta levels reported here represents a possible approach for determining effects of Abeta reduction in normally functioning eyes and in models of retinal degenerative disease.",

    "title": "System tradeoffs in siting a solar photovoltaic material recovery infrastructure.",
    "abstract": "The consumption and disposal of rare and hazardous metals contained in electronics and emerging technologies such as photovoltaics increases the material complexity of the municipal waste stream. Developing effective waste policies and material recovery systems is required to inhibit landfilling of valuable and finite resources. This work developed a siting and waste infrastructure configuration model to inform the management and recovery of end-of-life photovoltaics. This model solves the siting and waste location-allocation problem for a New York State case study by combining multi-criteria decision methods with spatial tools, however this methodology is generalizable to any geographic area. For the case study, the results indicate that PV installations are spatially statistically significant (i.e., clustered). At least 9 sites, which are co-located with landfills and current MRFs, were 'highly' suitable for siting according to our criteria. After combining criteria in an average weighted sum, 86% of the study area was deemed unsuitable for siting while less than 5% is characterized as highly suitable. This method implicitly prioritized social and environmental concerns and therefore, these concerns accounted for the majority of siting decisions. As we increased the priority of economic criteria, the likelihood of siting near ecologically sensitive areas such as coastline or socially vulnerable areas such as urban centers increased. The sensitivity of infrastructure configurations to land use and waste policy are analyzed. The location allocation model results suggest current tip fees are insufficient to avoid landfilling of photovoltaics. Scenarios where tip fees were increased showed model results where facilities decide to adopt limited recycling technologies that bypass compositionally complex materials; a result with strong implications for global PV installations as well as other waste streams. We suggest a multi-pronged approach that lowers technology cost, imposes a minimum collection rate, and implements higher tip fees would encourage exhaustive material recovery for solar photovoltaic modules at end-of-life, beyond New York State. These results have important implications for policy makers and waste managers especially in locations where there is rapid adoption of renewable energy technologies.",

    "title": "Longitudinal Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarker Changes in Preclinical Alzheimer Disease During Middle Age.",
    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Individuals in the presymptomatic stage of Alzheimer disease (AD) are increasingly being targeted for AD secondary prevention trials. How early during the normal life span underlying AD pathologies begin to develop, their patterns of change over time, and their relationship with future cognitive decline remain to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the within-person trajectories of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD over time and their association with changes in brain amyloid deposition and cognitive decline in cognitively normal middle-aged individuals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: As part of a cohort study, cognitively normal (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] of 0) middle-aged research volunteers (n = 169) enrolled in the Adult Children Study at Washington University, St Louis, Missouri, had undergone serial CSF collection and longitudinal clinical assessment (mean, 6 years; range, 0.91-11.3 years) at 3-year intervals at the time of analysis, between January 2003 and November 2013. A subset (n = 74) had also undergone longitudinal amyloid positron emission tomographic imaging with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) in the same period. Serial CSF samples were analyzed for beta-amyloid 40 (Abeta40), Abeta42, total tau, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau181), visinin-like protein 1 (VILIP-1), and chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40). Within-person measures were plotted according to age and AD risk defined by APOE genotype (epsilon4 carriers vs noncarriers). Linear mixed models were used to compare estimated biomarker slopes among middle-age bins at baseline (early, 45-54 years; mid, 55-64 years; late, 65-74 years) and between risk groups. Within-person changes in CSF biomarkers were also compared with changes in cortical PiB binding and progression to a CDR higher than 0 at follow-up. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in Abeta40, Abeta42, total tau, P-tau181, VILIP-1, and YKL-40 and, in a subset of participants, changes in cortical PiB binding. RESULTS: While there were no consistent longitudinal patterns in Abeta40 (P = .001-.97), longitudinal reductions in Abeta42 were observed in some individuals as early as early middle age (P <= .05) and low Abeta42 levels were associated with the development of cortical PiB-positive amyloid plaques (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.9352; 95% CI, 0.8895-0.9808), especially in mid middle age (P < .001). Markers of neuronal injury (total tau, P-tau181, and VILIP-1) dramatically increased in some individuals in mid and late middle age (P <= .02), whereas the neuroinflammation marker YKL-40 increased consistently throughout middle age (P <= .003). These patterns were more apparent in at-risk epsilon4 carriers (Abeta42 in an allele dose-dependent manner) and appeared to be associated with future cognitive deficits as determined by CDR. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Longitudinal CSF biomarker patterns consistent with AD are first detectable during early middle age and are associated with later amyloid positivity and cognitive decline. Such measures may be useful for targeting middle-aged, asymptomatic individuals for therapeutic trials designed to prevent cognitive decline.",

METHODS: One-hundred forty-two patients with PEX have been included for this study; median age: 75 years (Q1 = 71,5; Q3 = 80,0). Control group comprised 93 subjects aged 74 years (Q1 = 68,0; Q3 = 80,0). Amyloid beta-40 and beta-42 (Abeta-40, Abeta-42) concentrations were assessed in plasma in 73 PEX patients and 49 controls. Abeta-40 concentration in aqueous humor was measured in 31 patients from each group. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clock Drawing Tests were performed in 83 PEX patients and 36 controls. RESULTS: The differences between amyloid concentrations both in plasma and in aqueous humor in PEX and control groups were not statistically significant. There were no differences in MMSE and Clock Drawing Tests between groups. CONCLUSION: Our results do not indicate any relation between PEX and Alzheimer's amyloids or cognitive functions in cataract patients.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a currently incurable neurodegenerative disorder and is the most common form of dementia in people over the age of 65 years. The predominant genetic risk factor for AD is the epsilon4 allele encoding apolipoprotein E (ApoE4). The secreted glycoprotein Reelin enhances synaptic plasticity by binding to the multifunctional ApoE receptors apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (Apoer2) and very low density lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr). We have previously shown that the presence of ApoE4 renders neurons unresponsive to Reelin by impairing the recycling of the receptors, thereby decreasing its protective effects against amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomer-induced synaptic toxicity in vitro. We showed that when Reelin was knocked out in adult mice, these mice behaved normally without overt learning or memory deficits. However, they were strikingly sensitive to amyloid-induced synaptic suppression and had profound memory and learning disabilities with very low amounts of amyloid deposition. Our findings highlight the physiological importance of Reelin in protecting the brain against Abeta-induced synaptic dysfunction and memory impairment.",

    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide aggregates in the brain to form progressively larger oligomers, fibrils, and plaques. The aggregation process is strongly influenced by the presence of other macromolecular species, called crowders, that can exert forces on the proteins. One very common attribute of macromolecular crowders is their hydrophobicity. We examined the effect of hydrophobic crowders on protein aggregation by using discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations in combination with an intermediate resolution protein model, PRIME20. The systems considered contained 48 Abeta (16-22) peptides and crowders with diameters of 5 A, 20 A, and 40 A, represented by hard spheres or spheres with square-well/square-shoulder interactions, at a crowder volume fraction of phi = 0.10. Results show that low levels of crowder hydrophobicity are capable of increasing the fibrillation lag time and high levels of crowder hydrophobicity can fully prevent the formation of fibrils. The types of structures that remain during the final stages of the simulations are summarized in a global phase diagram that shows fibril, disordered oligomer, or beta-sheet phases in the space spanned by crowder size and crowder hydrophobicity. In particular, at high levels of hydrophobicity, simulations with 5 A crowders result in only disordered oligomers and simulations with 40 A crowders result in only beta-sheets. The presence of hydrophobic crowders reduces the antiparallel beta-sheet content of fibrils, whereas hard sphere crowders increase it. Finally, strong hydrophobic crowders alter the secondary structure of the Abeta (16-22) monomers, bending them into a shape that is incapable of forming ordered beta-sheets or fibrils. These results qualitatively agree with previous theoretical and experimental work.",

P-gp also extrudes brain amyloid-beta (Abeta). Accumulation of Abeta is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta accumulates in normal aging and in AD primarily due to decreased Abeta clearance. This is a preliminary report on the relative protein and messenger RNA expression of P-gp in human brains, ages 20-100 years, including AD subjects. In these preliminary studies, cortical endothelial P-gp expression decreased in AD compared with controls (p < 0.001). Trends in P-gp expression in human aging are similar to aging rats. Microvessel P-gp messenger RNA remained unchanged with aging and AD. Abeta plaques were found in 42.8% of normal subjects (54.5% of those older than 50 years). A qualitative analysis showed that P-gp expression is lower than the group mean in subjects older than 75 years but increased if younger. Decreased P-gp expression may be related to Abeta plaques in aging and AD. Downregulating P-gp to allow pharmaceuticals into the central nervous system may increase Abeta accumulation.",

    "title": "Estimating Total Cerebral Microinfarct Burden From Diffusion-Weighted Imaging.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral microinfarcts (CMI) are important contributors to vascular cognitive impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensities have been suggested to represent acute CMI. We aim to describe a mathematical method for estimating total number of CMI based on the presence of incidental DWI lesions. METHODS: We reviewed magnetic resonance imaging scans of subjects with cognitive decline, cognitively normal subjects and previously reported subjects with past intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Based on temporal and spatial characteristics of DWI lesions, we estimated the annual rate of CMI needed to explain the observed rate of DWI lesion detection in each group. To confirm our estimates, we performed extensive sampling for CMI in the brain of a deceased subject with past lobar ICH who found to have a DWI lesion during life. RESULTS: Clinically silent DWI lesions were present in 13 of 343 (3.8%) cognitively impaired and 10 of 199 (5%) cognitively intact normal non-ICH patients, both lower than the incidence in the past ICH patients (23 of 178; 12.9%; P<0.0006). The predicted annual incidence of CMI ranges from 16 to 1566 for non-ICH and 50 to 5041 for ICH individuals. Histological sampling revealed a total of 60 lesions in 32 sections. Based on previously reported methods, this density of CMI yields an estimated total brain burden maximum likelihood estimate of 9321 CMIs (95% confidence interval, 7255-11 990). CONCLUSIONS: Detecting even a single DWI lesion suggests an annual incidence of hundreds of new CMI. The cumulative effects of these lesions may directly contribute to small-vessel-related vascular cognitive impairment.",

    "title": "Heme Stabilization of alpha-Synuclein Oligomers during Amyloid Fibril Formation.",
    "abstract": "alpha-Synuclein (alphaSyn), which forms amyloid fibrils, is linked to the neuronal pathology of Parkinson's disease, as it is the major fibrillar component of Lewy bodies, the inclusions that are characteristic of the disease. Oligomeric structures, common to many neurodegenerative disease-related proteins, may in fact be the primary toxic species, while the amyloid fibrils exist either as a less toxic dead-end species or even as a beneficial mechanism for clearing damaged proteins. To alter the progression of the aggregation and gain insights into the prefibrillar structures, we determined the effect of heme on alphaSyn oligomerization by several different techniques, including native (nondenaturing) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thioflavin T fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, circular dichroism, and membrane permeation using a calcein release assay. During aggregation, heme is able to bind the alphaSyn in a specific fashion, stabilizing distinct oligomeric conformations and promoting the formation of alphaSyn into annular structures, thereby delaying and/or inhibiting the fibrillation process. These results indicate that heme may play a regulatory role in the progression of Parkinson's disease; in addition, they provide insights into how the aggregation process may be altered, which may be applicable to the understanding of many neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) are antidepressant drugs currently studied for their neuroprotective properties in neurodegenerative disorders. In the present work MAOIs such as tranylcypromine [trans-(+)-2-phenylcyclopropanamine, TCP] and its amide derivatives, TCP butyramide (TCP-But) and TCP acetamide (TCP-Ac), were tested for their ability to protect cortical neurons challenged with synthetic amyloid-beta (Abeta)-(1-42) oligomers (100 nM) for 48 h. TCP significantly prevented Abeta-induced neuronal death in a concentration-dependent fashion and was maximally protective only at 10 microM. TCP-But was maximally protective in mixed neuronal cultures at 1 microM, a lower concentration compared to TCP, whereas the new derivative, TCP-Ac, was more efficacious than TCP and TCP-But and significantly protected cortical neurons against Abeta toxicity at nanomolar concentrations (100 nM). Experiments carried out with the Thioflavin-T (Th-T) fluorescence assay for fibril formation showed that TCP and its amide derivatives influenced the early events of the Abeta aggregation process in a concentration-dependent manner. TCP-Ac was more effective than TCP-But and TCP in slowing down the Abeta(1-42) aggregates formation through a lengthening at the lag phase. In our experimental model co-incubation of Abeta(1-42) oligomers with TCP-Ac was able to almost completely prevent Abeta-induced neurodegeneration. These results suggest that inhibition of Abeta oligomer-mediated aggregation significantly contributes to the overall neuroprotective activity of TCP-Ac and also raise the possibility that TCP, and in particular the new compound TCP-Ac, might represent new pharmacological tools to yield neuroprotection in AD.",

The development of new tools for the quantitative measurement of biomarkers is gaining experimental momentum due to recent advances in high-throughput screening analysis and with the optimization of assays for their quantification in biological fluids, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based immunoassays have demonstrated to achieve clinical quality performance in a variety of sample types due to its high sensitivity and dynamic range. Here, we quantified the CSF levels of Tau-protein, beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta42) and alpha-synuclein, as important biomarkers in CSF used in the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders in 12 AD, 12 sCJD and 12 control cases by singleplex ECL-based technology. Its performance has been compared to classical enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to confront their clinical accuracy. ECL-based technology validates previous data obtained with ELISA and presents a higher performance in the discrimination of three analysed groups as determined by increased area under the curve (AUC) values for the three biomarkers. Importantly, alpha-synuclein levels detected by ECL allow an excellent discrimination between sCJD cases and AD and control cases, unveiling a new clinical approach for the differential diagnosis of sCJD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the extracellular accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta), which is accompanied by a robust inflammatory response in the brain. Both of these pathogenic processes are regulated by nuclear receptors, including the liver X receptors (LXRs) and peroxisome-proliferator receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Agonists of LXRs have been demonstrated previously to reduce Abeta levels and improve cognitive deficits in AD mouse models by inducing the transcription and lipidation of apolipoprotein E (apoE). Agonists targeting PPARgamma reduce the microglial expression of proinflammatory genes and have also been shown to modulate apoE expression. Here we investigate whether a combination therapy with both LXR and PPARgamma agonists results in increased benefits in an AD mouse model. We found that the LXR agonist GW3965 and the PPARgamma agonist pioglitazone were individually able to increase the levels of apoE and related genes, decrease the expression of proinflammatory genes, and facilitate Abeta decreases in the hippocampus. Combined treatment with both agonists provoked a further increase in the expression of apoE and a decrease in the soluble and deposited forms of Abeta. The decrease in plaques was associated with increased colocalization between microglia and plaques. In addition, the PPARgamma agonist in the combined treatment paradigm was able to counteract the elevation in plasma triglycerides that is a side effect of LXR agonist treatment. These results suggest that combined LXR/PPARgamma agonist treatment merits further investigation for the treatment of AD.",

This study was carried out to examine the effects of LTG on cognitive dysfunction, beta-amyloid1-42 accumulation, and tau protein hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus of ischemic rats. Transient ischemic stroke was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. The Morris water maze test was used to evaluate the cognitive function of rats. We found that LTG significantly attenuated ischemia-induced cognitive deficits and decreased neuronal injury in the hippocampal CA1 zone. Moreover, LTG reduced beta-amyloid1-42 and phosphorylated tau (AT8) in the hippocampus after ischemia. These results suggested that the cognition-protective effects of LTG after cerebral ischemia might involve inhibition of toxic beta-amyloid accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation in the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The variant amyloid deposits (VAD) include cotton wool plaques and diffuse plaques, which are associated with various motor deficits (e.g. spastic paraparesis, myoclonus, parkinsonism and ataxia). VADs have been repeatedly identified in presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutations. It is still unknown the effect of VAD on the motor deficits as well as on the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature using MEDLINE, AD&FTDMDB and China National Knowledge Infrastructure database. RESULTS: A total of 46 studies on 84 patients were included. We found that the odds ratio of the motor deficits in the VAD group (56 patients) was 4.231 times of the non-VAD group (28 patients). Moreover, VAD group displayed older age of onset (42.80+-9.12 years) and longer duration (9.05+-4.75 years) of the diseases. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that the VADs might be associated with the increased occurrence of the motor deficits. Moreover, the VADs might act as a protective modifier of the disease course of AD.",

    "abstract": "We examined the contribution of candidates genes for Alzheimer's disease (AD) to individual differences in levels of beta amyloid peptides in adults with Down syndrom, a population at high risk for AD. Participants were 254 non-demented adults with Down syndrome, 30-78 years of age. Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid was genotyped using an Illumina GoldenGate custom array. We used linear regression to examine differences in levels of Abeta peptides associated with the number of risk alleles, adjusting for age, sex, level of intellectual disability, race and/or ethnicity, and the presence of the APOE epsilon4 allele. For Abeta42 levels, the strongest gene-wise association was found for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on CAHLM1; for Abeta40 levels, the strongest gene-wise associations were found for SNPs in IDE and SOD1, while the strongest gene-wise associations with levels of the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio were found for SNPs in SORCS1. Broadly classified, variants in these genes may influence amyloid precursor protein processing (CALHM1, IDE), vesicular trafficking (SORCS1), and response to oxidative stress (SOD1).",

Contributions of ROHs to the genetic architecture of coronary artery disease and regulation of gene expression in cells relevant to atherosclerosis are not known. Our combined analysis of 24,320 individuals from 11 populations of white European ethnicity showed an association between coronary artery disease and both the count and the size of ROHs. Individuals with coronary artery disease had approximately 0.63 (95% CI: 0.4-0.8) excess of ROHs when compared to coronary-artery-disease-free control subjects (p = 1.49 x 10(-9)). The average total length of ROHs was approximately 1,046.92 (95% CI: 634.4-1,459.5) kb greater in individuals with coronary artery disease than control subjects (p = 6.61 x 10(-7)). None of the identified individual ROHs was associated with coronary artery disease after correction for multiple testing. However, in aggregate burden analysis, ROHs favoring increased risk of coronary artery disease were much more common than those showing the opposite direction of association with coronary artery disease (p = 2.69 x 10(-33)). Individual ROHs showed significant associations with monocyte and macrophage expression of genes in their close proximity-subjects with several individual ROHs showed significant differences in the expression of 44 mRNAs in monocytes and 17 mRNAs in macrophages when compared to subjects without those ROHs. This study provides evidence for an excess of homozygosity in coronary artery disease in outbred populations and suggest the potential biological relevance of ROHs in cells of importance to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling disturbances in Alzheimer s disease (AD) have been demonstrated. BDNF levels fall in AD, but the ratio between truncated and full-length BDNF receptors TrkB.T1 and TrkB.TK, respectively, increases in brains of AD patients and APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) AD model mice. Dopaminergic (DAergic) system disturbances in AD and detrimental effects of BDNF signaling deficits on DAergic system functions have also been indicated. Against this, we investigated changes in nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) system in mice carrying APP/PS1 and/or TrkB.T1 transgenes, the latter line modeling the TrkB.T1/TK ratio change in AD. Employing in vivo voltammetry, we found normal short-term DA release in caudate-putamen of mice carrying APP/PS1 or TrkB.T1 transgenes but impaired capacity to recruit more DA upon prolonged stimulation. However, mice carrying both transgenes did not differ from wild-type controls. Immunohistochemistry revealed normal density of tyrosine hydroxylase positive axon terminals in caudate-putamen in all genotypes and intact presynaptic machinery for DA release and reuptake, as shown by unchanged levels of SNAP-25, alpha-synuclein and DA transporter. However, we observed increased DAergic neurons in substantia nigra of TrkB.T1 mice resulting in decreased tyrosine hydroxylase per neuron in TrkB.T1 mice. The finding of unchanged nigral DAergic neurons in APP/PS1 mice largely confirms earlier reports, but the unexpected increase in midbrain DA neurons in TrkB.T1 mice is a novel finding. We suggest that both APP/PS1 and TrkB.T1 genotypes disrupt DAergic signaling, but via separate mechanisms.",

The Abeta1-x (x=16/28/40/42) peptides have been the primary focus of Cu(II) binding studies for more than 15 years; however, the N-truncated Abeta4-42 peptide is a major Abeta isoform detected in both healthy and diseased brains, and it contains a novel N-terminal FRH sequence. Proteins with His at the third position are known to bind Cu(II) avidly, with conditional log K values at pH 7.4 in the range of 11.0-14.6, which is much higher than that determined for Abeta1-x peptides. By using Abeta4-16 as a model, it was demonstrated that its FRH sequence stoichiometrically binds Cu(II) with a conditional Kd value of 3x10(-14)  M at pH 7.4, and that both Abeta4-16 and Abeta4-42 possess negligible redox activity. Combined with the predominance of Abeta4-42 in the brain, our results suggest a physiological role for this isoform in metal homeostasis within the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the role of multiple pathologies in the expression of dementia in the oldest-old. METHODS: A total of 183 participants of The 90+ Study with longitudinal follow-up and autopsy were included in this clinical-pathologic investigation. Eight pathologic diagnoses (Alzheimer disease [AD], microinfarcts, hippocampal sclerosis, macroinfarcts, Lewy body disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, white matter disease, and others) were dichotomized. We estimated the odds of dementia in relation to each individual pathologic diagnosis and to the total number of diagnoses. We also examined dementia severity in relation to number of pathologic diagnoses. RESULTS: The presence of multiple pathologic diagnoses was common and occurred more frequently in those with dementia compared with those without dementia (45% vs 14%). Higher numbers of pathologic diagnoses were also associated with greater dementia severity. Participants with intermediate/high AD pathology alone were 3 times more likely to have dementia (odds ratio = 3.5), but those with single non-AD pathologies were 12 times more likely to have dementia (odds ratio = 12.4). When a second pathology was present, the likelihood of dementia increased 4-fold in those with intermediate/high AD pathology but did not change in those with non-AD pathologies, suggesting that pathologies may interrelate in different ways. CONCLUSIONS: In the oldest-old, the presence of multiple pathologies is associated with increased likelihood and severity of dementia. The effect of the individual pathologies may be additive or perhaps synergistic and requires further research. Multiple pathologies will need to be targeted to reduce the burden of dementia in the population.",

    "title": "Network Disruption and Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid-Beta and Phospho-Tau Levels in Mild Cognitive Impairment.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Synaptic dysfunction is a core deficit in Alzheimer's disease, preceding hallmark pathological abnormalities. Resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to assess whether functional connectivity patterns, as an index of synaptic dysfunction, are associated with CSF biomarkers [i.e., phospho-tau (p-tau) and amyloid beta (Abeta42) levels]. We studied 12 human subjects diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, comparing those with normal and abnormal CSF levels of the biomarkers. We also evaluated the association between aberrant functional connections and structural connectivity abnormalities, measured with diffusion tensor imaging, as well as the convergent impact of cognitive deficits and CSF variables on network disorganization. One-third of the patients converted to Alzheimer's disease during a follow-up period of 2.5 years. Patients with abnomal CSF p-tau and Abeta42 levels exhibited both reduced and increased functional connectivity affecting limbic structures such as the anterior/posterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and medial temporal areas in different frequency bands. A reduction in posterior cingulate functional connectivity mediated by p-tau was associated with impaired axonal integrity of the hippocampal cingulum. We noted that several connectivity abnormalities were predicted by CSF biomarkers and cognitive scores. These preliminary results indicate that CSF markers of amyloid deposition and neuronal injury in early Alzheimer's disease associate with a dual pattern of cortical network disruption, affecting key regions of the default mode network and the temporal cortex. MEG is useful to detect early synaptic dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease brain pathology in terms of functional network organization. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In this preliminary study, we used magnetoencephalography and an integrative approach to explore the impact of CSF biomarkers, neuropsychological scores, and white matter structural abnormalities on neural function in mild cognitive impairment. Disruption in functional connectivity between several pairs of cortical regions associated with abnormal levels of biomarkers, cognitive deficits, or with impaired axonal integrity of hippocampal tracts. Amyloid deposition and tau protein-related neuronal injury in early Alzheimer's disease are associated with synaptic dysfunction and a dual pattern of cortical network disorganization (i.e., desynchronization and hypersynchronization) that affects key regions of the default mode network and temporal areas.",

    "abstract": "The Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) regulates neuronal RNA metabolism, and its absence or mutations leads to the Fragile X syndrome (FXS). The beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is involved in Alzheimer's disease, plays a role in synapse formation, and is upregulated in intellectual disabilities. Here, we show that during mouse synaptogenesis and in human FXS fibroblasts, a dual dysregulation of APP and the alpha-secretase ADAM10 leads to the production of an excess of soluble APPalpha (sAPPalpha). In FXS, sAPPalpha signals through the metabotropic receptor that, activating the MAP kinase pathway, leads to synaptic and behavioral deficits. Modulation of ADAM10 activity in FXS reduces sAPPalpha levels, restoring translational control, synaptic morphology, and behavioral plasticity. Thus, proper control of ADAM10-mediated APP processing during a specific developmental postnatal stage is crucial for healthy spine formation and function(s). Downregulation of ADAM10 activity at synapses may be an effective strategy for ameliorating FXS phenotypes.",

Here, we compared cognitive functioning, vascular risk factors, and patterns of cortical thickness between cognitively intact elderly subjects with low (N = 60) and high (N = 60) plasma Abeta levels (cutoffs: 225 pg/mL and 23 pg/mL for Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42, respectively). Overall, subjects with high Abeta levels showed lower cognitive performance and thinner cortex than those with low Abeta levels. More specifically, subjects with high Abeta1-40 showed bilateral thinning of the prefrontal cortex, poorer objective memory, slower processing speed, and lower nonverbal reasoning skills, whereas subjects with high Abeta1-42 had thinner temporal lobe, poorer everyday memory, and increased levels of homocysteine. Overall, these results suggest that high plasma Abeta levels in normal elderly subjects are associated with subclinical markers of vulnerable aging, which may be helpful at predicting different trajectories of aging in cognitively intact older adults.",

Several underlying etiologies to this failure are proposed. First, accumulating evidence from past trials suggests a preventive as opposed to therapeutic paradigm, and the precise temporal and mechanistic relationship of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau protein should be elucidated to confirm this hypothesis. Second, we are in urgent need of revised diagnostic criteria to support future trials.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several studies have attempted to investigate whether variations in the Circle of Willis (COW) are more common in migraine patients and whether the subsequent changes in perfusion may contribute to the pathomechanism of migraine. However, studies are not in agreement as to whether or not there is an increased prevalence of COW variations in migraineurs. OBJECTIVE: To determine if migraine headaches are associated with variations in morphology of the COW. METHODS: A systemic search of the major electronic databases was performed for articles studying the association of variations in the COW and migraine. Data on the prevalence of variations in patients with migraine were extracted and pooled into the meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of four articles (n=807 patients) were deemed eligible for the meta-analysis. Migraine, regardless of subtype, was found to be associated with variations in the COW (OR=2.27, 95%CI 1.53-3.38, p<0.0001). An incomplete posterior circle (OR=2.60, 95%CI 1.79-3.76, p<0.00001) was found to be more strongly associated with migraine than an incomplete anterior circle (OR=2.01, 95%CI 1.15-3.53, p=0.01). In sub-group analysis, migraine with aura was found to be associated with both an incomplete posterior (OR=3.55, 95%CI 2.25-5.59, p<0.00001) and an incomplete anterior circle (OR=2.35, 95%CI 1.20-4.62, p=0.01). Migraine without aura was found only to be associated with an incomplete posterior circle (OR=2.10, 95%CI 1.39-3.17, p=0.0004). CONCLUSIONS: Migraine is associated with anatomical variations in both the anterior and posterior portions of the COW. However, larger prospective trials are needed to determine the true prevalence of variations and their pathological significance.",

    "abstract": "Although amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary pathology play important roles in Alzheimer disease (AD), our understanding of AD is incomplete, and the contribution of microglia and iron to neurodegeneration is unknown. High-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is exquisitely sensitive to microscopic iron. To explore iron-associated neuroinflammatory AD pathology, we studied AD and control human brain specimens by (1) performing ultra-high resolution ex vivo 7 Tesla MRI, (2) coregistering the MRI with successive histologic staining for iron, microglia, amyloid beta, and tau, and (3) quantifying the relationship between magnetic resonance signal intensity and histological staining. In AD, we identified numerous small MR hypointensities primarily within the subiculum that were best explained by the combination of microscopic iron and activated microglia (p = 0.025), in contradistinction to the relatively lesser contribution of tau or amyloid. Neuropathologically, this suggests that microglial-mediated neurodegeneration may occur in the hippocampal formation in AD and is detectable by ultra-high resolution MRI.",

    "abstract": "Sulfuretin, one of the major flavonoid glycosides found in the stem bark of Albizzia julibrissin and heartwood of Rhus verniciflua, is a known anti-oxidant. We previously demonstrated that sulfuretin inhibits neuronal death via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanisms in human SH-SY5Y cells, although other relevant mechanisms of action of this compound remain largely uncharacterized. As part of our ongoing exploration of the pharmacological actions of sulfuretin, we studied the neuroprotective effects of sulfuretin against amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity in human SH-SY5Y and primary hippocampal neuron cells and investigated the possible mechanisms involved. Specifically, we found in the present study that sulfuretin significantly attenuates the decrease in cell viability, release of lactate dehydrogenase, and accumulation of ROS associated with Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity in neuronal cells. Furthermore, sulfuretin stimulated the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K)/Akt. We demonstrated that sulfuretin induces the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an anti-oxidant response gene. Notably, we found that the neuroprotective effects of sulfuretin were diminished by an Nrf2 small interfering RNA (siRNA), the HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP), as well as the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002. Taken together, these results indicated that sulfuretin protects neuronal cells from Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity through activation of Nrf/HO-1 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Our results also indicate that sulfuretin-induced induction of Nrf2-dependent HO-1 expression via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway has preventive and/or therapeutic potential for the management of Alzheimer's disease.",

We identified seven types of tau modifications at 63 sites in wild-type mice. Wild-type and hAPP mice had similar modifications, supporting the hypothesis that neuronal dysfunction in hAPP mice is enabled by physiological forms of tau. Our findings provide clear evidence for acetylation and ubiquitination of the same lysine residues; some sites were also targeted by lysine methylation. Our findings refute the hypothesis of extensive O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification of endogenous tau.

    "abstract": "beta-Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its cleaved products are strongly implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Endosomes are highly active APP processing sites, and endosome anomalies associated with upregulated expression of early endosomal regulator, rab5, are the earliest known disease-specific neuronal response in AD. Here, we show that the rab5 effector APPL1 (adaptor protein containing pleckstrin homology domain, phosphotyrosine binding domain and leucine zipper motif) mediates rab5 overactivation in Down syndrome (DS) and AD, which is caused by elevated levels of the beta-cleaved carboxy-terminal fragment of APP (betaCTF). betaCTF recruits APPL1 to rab5 endosomes, where it stabilizes active GTP-rab5, leading to pathologically accelerated endocytosis, endosome swelling and selectively impaired axonal transport of rab5 endosomes. In DS fibroblasts, APPL1 knockdown corrects these endosomal anomalies. betaCTF levels are also elevated in AD brain, which is accompanied by abnormally high recruitment of APPL1 to rab5 endosomes as seen in DS fibroblasts. These studies indicate that persistent rab5 overactivation through betaCTF-APPL1 interactions constitutes a novel APP-dependent pathogenic pathway in AD.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of toxic protein aggregates-amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles-is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). Abeta accumulation has been hypothesized to result from an imbalance between Abeta production and clearance; indeed, Abeta clearance seems to be impaired in both early and late forms of AD. To develop efficient strategies to slow down or halt AD, it is critical to understand how Abeta is cleared from the brain. Extracellular Abeta deposits can be removed from the brain by various clearance systems, most importantly, transport across the blood-brain barrier. Findings from the past few years suggest that astroglial-mediated interstitial fluid (ISF) bulk flow, known as the glymphatic system, might contribute to a larger portion of extracellular Abeta (eAbeta) clearance than previously thought. The meningeal lymphatic vessels, discovered in 2015, might provide another clearance route. Because these clearance systems act together to drive eAbeta from the brain, any alteration to their function could contribute to AD. An understanding of Abeta clearance might provide strategies to reduce excess Abeta deposits and delay, or even prevent, disease onset. In this Review, we describe the clearance systems of the brain as they relate to proteins implicated in AD pathology, with the main focus on Abeta.",

    "abstract": "Cholinergic neuronal loss is a common finding in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD model mice. We previously transplanted neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells into the hippocampus of human amyloid precursor protein transgenic AD model mice. In the present study, we examined the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the alleviation of cognitive dysfunction in transplanted mice. After transplant, mice showed improvement in cognitive function, confirming our previous findings. Human choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive cholinergic neurons were distributed throughout the cortex of the grafted mice. Human and mouse ChAT-positive neurons and alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR)-positive neurons were significantly increased in the cortex and hippocampus of the grafted mice compared with the vehicle-injected mice. In addition, human and mouse vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT)-positive neurons were located mainly in the hippocampus and, though the number was small, human VGAT-positive neurons were observed in the cortex. In the grafted mouse cortex, the number of GABA receptor (GABAR)-positive neurons of both human origin and mouse origin were significantly increased compared with those in the vehicle-injected mouse cortex. The alpha7nAChR-positive and GABAR-positive neurons expressed phosphorylated Akt and c-fos in the cortex, suggesting that these receptor-expressing neurons were possibly activated by the neurotransmitters secreted from the grafted neurons. Collectively, the grafted and host neurons may form positive feedback loops via neurotransmitter secretion in both the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, leading to alleviation of cognitive dysfunction in dementia model mice.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) that has been suggested to be the trigger of AD pathology. However, whether oxidative damage precedes and contributes directly to the intracellular accumulation of beta amyloid 1-42 (betaA42) peptide remains a matter of debate. Chronic exposure to low doses of ozone similar to the levels during a day of high pollution in Mexico City causes a state of oxidative stress that elicits progressive neurodegeneration in the hippocampi of rats. Several reports have demonstrated that the mitochondria are among the first organelles to be affected by oxidative stress and betaA42 toxicity and act as sites of the accumulation of betaA42, which affects energy metabolism. However, the mechanisms related to the neurodegeneration process and organelle damage that occur in conditions of chronic exposure to low doses of ozone have not been demonstrated. To analyze the effect of chronic ozone chronic exposure on changes in the production and accumulation of the betaA42 and betaA40 peptides in the mitochondria of hippocampal neurons of rats exposed to ozone, we examined the mitochondrial expression levels of Presenilins 1 and 2 and ADAM10 to detect changes related to the oxidative stress caused by low doses of ozone (0.25ppm). The results revealed significant accumulations of betaA42 peptide in the mitochondrial fractions on days 60 and 90 of ozone exposure along with reductions in beta amyloid 1-40 accumulation, significant overexpressions of Pres2 and significant reductions in ADAM10 expression. Beta amyloid immunodetection revealed that there were some intracellular deposits of betaA42 and that betaA42 and the mitochondrial markers OPA1 and COX1 colocalized. These results indicate that the time of exposure to ozone and the accumulation of betaA42 in the mitochondria of the hippocampal cells of rats were correlated. Our results suggest that the accumulation of the betaA42 peptide may promote mitochondrial dysfunction due to its accumulation and overproduction.",

The contact of Abeta with the extracellular membrane promotes RhoA activation, leading to growth cone collapse and neurite retraction, which might be responsible for hampered neuronal pathfinding and migration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The inhibition of HDAC6 by Abeta increases the level of heterodimeric acetylated tubulin and acetylated tau, both of which have been found altered in AD. We also find that the loss of HDAC6 activity perturbs the integrity of axon initial segment (AIS), resulting in mislocalization of ankyrin G and increased MT instability in the AIS concomitant with loss of polarized localization of tau and impairment of action potential firing.",

    "title": "Near-infrared fluorescence molecular imaging of amyloid beta species and monitoring therapy in animal models of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) molecular imaging has been widely applied to monitoring therapy of cancer and other diseases in preclinical studies; however, this technology has not been applied successfully to monitoring therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although several NIRF probes for detecting amyloid beta (Abeta) species of AD have been reported, none of these probes has been used to monitor changes of Abetas during therapy. In this article, we demonstrated that CRANAD-3, a curcumin analog, is capable of detecting both soluble and insoluble Abeta species. In vivo imaging showed that the NIRF signal of CRANAD-3 from 4-mo-old transgenic AD (APP/PS1) mice was 2.29-fold higher than that from age-matched wild-type mice, indicating that CRANAD-3 is capable of detecting early molecular pathology. To verify the feasibility of CRANAD-3 for monitoring therapy, we first used the fast Abeta-lowering drug LY2811376, a well-characterized beta-amyloid cleaving enzyme-1 inhibitor, to treat APP/PS1 mice. Imaging data suggested that CRANAD-3 could monitor the decrease in Abetas after drug treatment. To validate the imaging capacity of CRANAD-3 further, we used it to monitor the therapeutic effect of CRANAD-17, a curcumin analog for inhibition of Abeta cross-linking. The imaging data indicated that the fluorescence signal in the CRANAD-17-treated group was significantly lower than that in the control group, and the result correlated with ELISA analysis of brain extraction and Abeta plaque counting. It was the first time, to our knowledge, that NIRF was used to monitor AD therapy, and we believe that our imaging technology has the potential to have a high impact on AD drug development.",

    "title": "Dual pathways mediate beta-amyloid stimulated glutathione release from astrocytes.",
    "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays an important role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative conditions. Glutathione (GSH), the major antioxidant in the central nervous system, is primarily synthesized and released by astrocytes. We determined if beta-amyloid (Abeta42), crucially involved in Alzheimer's disease, affected GSH release. Monomeric Abeta (mAbeta) stimulated GSH release from cultured cortical astrocytes more effectively than oligomeric Abeta (oAbeta) or fibrillary Abeta (fAbeta). Monomeric Abeta increased the expression of the transporter ABCC1 (also referred to as MRP1) that is the main pathway for GSH release. GSH release from astrocytes, with or without mAbeta stimulation, was reduced by pharmacological inhibition of ABCC1. Astrocytes robustly express connexin proteins, especially connexin43 (Cx43), and mAbeta also stimulated Cx43 hemichannel-mediated glutamate and GSH release. Abeta-stimulation facilitated hemichannel opening in the presence of normal extracellular calcium by reducing astrocyte cholesterol level. Abeta treatment did not alter the intracellular concentration of reduced or oxidized glutathione. Using a mouse model of AD with early onset Abeta deposition (5xFAD), we found that cortical ABCC1 was significantly increased in temporal register with the surge of Abeta levels in these mice. ABCC1 levels remained elevated from 1.5 to 3.5 months of age in 5xFAD mice, before plunging to subcontrol levels when amyloid plaques appeared. Similarly, in cultured astrocytes, prolonged incubation with aggregated Abeta, but not mAbeta, reduced induction of ABCC1 expression. These results support the hypothesis that in the early stage of AD pathogenesis, less aggregated Abeta increases GSH release from astrocytes (via ABCC1 transporters and Cx43 hemichannels) providing temporary protection from oxidative stress which promotes AD development.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To examine the associations between amyloid-beta brain deposition and physical activity (PA) in elderly adults without dementia and to investigate whether the association has a dose-response relationship. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: French community-dwelling people. PARTICIPANTS: Elderly adults with normal or mildly impaired cognition (mean age 74.7 +- 4.2; 60.4% female) with available information on current self-reported PA and amyloid-beta brain deposition measured using positron emission tomography (PET) using the PET-ligand florbetapir F 18 (n = 268). MEASUREMENTS: A standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was obtained for each subject. Participants were divided according to amyloid plaque cortical retention defined according to a SUVR cutoff of 1.10 (SUVR+ vs SUVR-). RESULTS: Bivariate and multivariate analyses showed that PA was not significantly associated with SUVR. SUVR+ and SUVR- participants did not differ in terms of volume (continuous PA variables) and levels (categorical PA variables) of PA. PA was not correlated with SUVR in apolipoprotein E epsilon4 carriers or noncarriers. PA was not associated with cognitive function. CONCLUSION: Although PA protects against dementia, there is no solid evidence that this protection involves a reduction in amyloid-beta brain deposition. Further studies are needed to determine whether PA (ideally measured at several time-points using objective measures) is involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging biomarkers, namely hippocampal volume loss, temporoparietal hypometabolism, and neocortical beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition, are included in the recent research criteria for preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how to use these biomarkers is still being debated, especially regarding their sequence. Our aim was to characterize the cognitive and brain profiles of elders classified as positive or negative for each biomarker to further our understanding of their use in the preclinical diagnosis of AD. Fifty-four cognitively normal individuals (age = 65.8 +- 8.3 years) underwent neuropsychological tests (structural MRI, FDG-PET, and Florbetapir-PET) and were dichotomized into positive or negative independently for each neuroimaging biomarker. Demographic, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging data were compared between positive and negative subgroups. The MRI-positive subgroup had lower executive performances and mixed patterns of lower volume and metabolism in AD-characteristic regions and in the prefrontal cortex. The FDG-positive subgroup showed only hypometabolism, predominantly in AD-sensitive areas extending to the whole neocortex, compared with the FDG-negative subgroup. The amyloid-positive subgroup was older and included more APOE epsilon4 carriers compared with the amyloid-negative subgroup. When considering MRI and/or FDG biomarkers together (i.e., the neurodegeneration-positive), there was a trend for an inverse relationship with Abeta deposition such that those with neurodegeneration tended to show less Abeta deposition and the reverse was true as well. Our findings suggest that: (1) MRI and FDG biomarkers provide complementary rather than redundant information and (2) relatively young cognitively normal elders tend to have either neurodegeneration or Abeta deposition, but not both, suggesting additive rather than sequential/causative links between AD neuroimaging biomarkers at this age. Significance statement: Neuroimaging biomarkers are included in the recent research criteria for preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how to use these biomarkers is still being debated, especially regarding their sequence. Our findings suggest that MRI and FDG-PET biomarkers should be used in combination, offering an additive contribution instead of reflecting the same process of neurodegeneration. Moreover, the present study also challenges the hierarchical use of the neuroimaging biomarkers in preclinical AD because it suggests that the neurodegeneration observed in this population is not due to beta-amyloid deposition. Rather, our results suggest that beta-amyloid- and tau-related pathological processes may interact but not necessarily appear in a systematic sequence.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Because of its genetic underpinnings and consistent age of onset within families, autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) provides a unique opportunity to conduct clinical trials of investigational agents as preventative or symptom-delaying treatments. The design of such trials may be complicated by low rates of genetic testing and disclosure among persons at risk of inheriting disease-causing mutations. METHODS: To better understand the attitudes toward genetic testing and clinical trials of persons at risk for ADAD, we surveyed participants in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN), a multisite longitudinal study of clinical and biomarker outcomes in ADAD that does not require learning genetic status to participate. RESULTS: Eighty participants completed a brief anonymous survey by mail or on-line; 40 % reported knowing if they carried a gene mutation, 15 % did not know but expressed a desire to learn their genetic status, and 45 % did not know and did not desire to know their genetic status. Among participants who knew or wished to know their genetic status, 86 % were interested in participating in a clinical trial. Seventy-two percent of participants who did not wish to learn their genetic status reported that they would change their mind, if learning that they carried a mutation gave them the opportunity to participate in a clinical trial. Nearly all participants responded that they would be interested if an open-label extension were offered. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the availability of clinical trials to prevent ADAD can affect persons' desire to undergo genetic testing and that consideration can be given to performing studies in which such testing is required.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cellular uptake of vitamin B12 (B12) demands binding of the vitamin to transcobalamin (TC) and recognition of TC-B12 (holoTC) by the receptor CD320. Recently, we identified a soluble form of CD320 (sCD320) in human plasma. Here we present data on the occurrence of this soluble receptor in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and show its correlations to dementia-related biomarkers tau proteins and amyloid-beta. METHODS: We collected 223 cerebrospinal fluid samples and corresponding plasma samples (n = 46). We measured CSF and plasma sCD320, holoTC and total TC employing in-house ELISA methods and CSF phospho-tau (181P) (p-tau), total tau (t-tau) and amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta) (n = 177) employing commercial ELISA kits (Innogenetics Company). Size exclusion chromatography was performed on a Superdex 200 column. RESULTS: The median sCD320 concentration in CSF (14 pmol/L) is around five times lower than in plasma (72 pmol/L). No correlation was observed between plasma and CSF sCD320 levels (n = 46), while the behavior upon size exclusion chromatography was the same. In CSF, sCD320 correlates to holoTC and total TC (Spearman's correlation (Rs) = 0.325, 0.232 (n = 218, 217) respectively, p < 0.01). Interestingly, sCD320 correlates to p-tau and t-tau (Rs = 0.599, 0.569 (n = 173, 176) respectively, p < 0.001) and to Abeta (Rs = 0.265, p < 0.001 (n = 177)). CONCLUSION: We document for the first time the occurrence of sCD320 in human CSF. We report that the concentration of sCD320 correlates to the dementia-related biomarkers p-tau, t-tau and Abeta.",

Here, we show that liraglutide has prophylactic properties. When injecting liraglutide once-daily ip. in two months old mice for 8 months, the main hallmarks of AD were much reduced. Memory formation in object recognition and Morris water maze were normalised and synapse loss and the loss of synaptic plasticity was prevented. In addition, amyloid plaque load, including dense core congophilic plaques, was much reduced. Chronic inflammation (activated microglia) was also reduced in the cortex, and neurogenesis was enhanced in the dentate gyrus. The results demonstrate that liraglutide may protect from progressive neurodegeneration that develops in AD. The drug is currently in clinical trials in patients with AD.",

These Abeta peptides are considered an important family of biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Due to their extremely low abundance in CSF (down to sub nM ranges), batch-wise preconcentration via magneto-immunocapture with enrichment factors up to 100 was implemented. The Abeta peptides were first captured onto magnetic micro-beads. Then, on-beads fluorescent labeling of the captured Abeta peptides were carried out to avoid the unwanted presence of extra fluorescent dye in the eluent as in the case of in-solution labeling. Finally thermal elution was performed and eluted labeled peptides were analyzed off line with CE-LIF. The Abeta-capturing efficiencies of different commercially available antibodies grafted onto magnetic beads were tested. Abeta peptides in CSF samples collected from AD's patients and healthy persons (used as controls) were measured and evaluated. As a proof of concept, the developed strategy was adapted into a miniaturized fluidized bed configuration that has the potential for coupling with a microchip separation system.",

However, there is a great need for standardization of methods used for quantification. To overcome problems associated with immunoassays, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has emerged as a critical orthogonal alternative. METHODS: We compared results for CSF Abeta42 quantification in a round robin study performed in four laboratories using similar sample preparation methods and LC-MS instrumentation. RESULTS: The LC-MS results showed excellent correlation between laboratories (r(2) >0.98), high analytical precision, and good correlation with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (r(2) >0.85). The use of a common reference sample further decreased interlaboratory variation. DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that LC-MS is suitable for absolute quantification of Abeta42 in CSF and highlight the importance of developing a certified reference material.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of still unknown etiology and the leading cause of dementia worldwide. Besides its main neuropathological hallmarks, a dysfunctional homeostasis of transition metals has been reported to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Dysregulation of iron (Fe) metabolism in AD has been suggested, particularly at the level of cellular iron efflux. Herein, we intended to further clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying Fe homeostasis in AD. In order to achieve this goal, the expression of specific Fe metabolism-related genes directly involved in Fe regulation and export was assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 73AD patients and 74 controls by quantitative PCR. The results obtained showed a significant decrease in the expression of aconitase 1 (ACO1; P=0.007); ceruloplasmin (CP; P<0.001) and amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP; P=0.006) genes in AD patients compared with healthy volunteers. These observations point out to a significant downregulation in the expression of genes associated with ferroportin-mediated cellular Fe export in PBMCs from AD patients, when compared to controls. Taken together, these findings support previous studies suggesting impairment of Fe homeostasis in AD, which may lead to cellular Fe retention and oxidative stress, a typical feature of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, progressive neurological disorder affecting elderly population of above 65 years of age, characterized by failure of memory, loss of acquired skills leading to apraxia, agnosia, aphasia and frequent disturbances in emotion with interpersonal and social deterioration. The extracellular senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of amyloid beta protein and highly phosphorylated tau protein, the key components involved in pathogenesis of AD are considered as the pathological hallmark of this disease. This has led to immense development in the field of treatment for AD. Recent evidences suggest that removal of protein deposits from AD brains are the newer attempts for treating AD. The major developments in this direction are the amyloid and tau based therapeutics, which could hold the key to treatment of AD in the near future. Several putative drugs have been thoroughly investigated in preclinical studies, but many of them have failed to produce results in the clinical scenario. Therefore, failures from the past can be treated as lessons for the development of efficacious drugs. In addition to this, various non- pharmacological interventions and miscellaneous drugs are also being used now for combating the AD like disease progression. Thus, present review discusses about the disease modifying therapies together with the various non-pharmacological interventions and miscellaneous drugs for treating AD.",

    "abstract": "At least 57 murine transgenic models for Alzheimer's disease (Tg-AD) have been developed to overexpress the 42 amino acid amyloid-beta (Abeta42) peptide in the central nervous system (CNS). These 'humanized murine Tg-AD models' have greatly expanded our understanding of the contribution of Abeta42 peptide-mediated pro-inflammatory neuropathology to the AD process. A number of independent laboratories using different amyloid-overexpressing Tg-AD models have shown that supplementation of murine Tg-AD diets and/or drinking water with aluminum significantly enhances Abeta42 peptide-mediated inflammatory pathology and AD-type cognitive change compared to animals receiving control diets. In humans AD-type pathology appears to originate in the limbic system and progressively spreads into primary processing and sensory regions such as the retina. In these studies, for the first time, we assess the propagation of Abeta42 and inflammatory signals into the retina of 5xFAD Tg-AD amyloid-overexpressing mice whose diets were supplemented with aluminum. The two most interesting findings were (1) that similar to other Tg-AD models, there was a significantly accelerated development of Abeta42 and inflammatory pathology in 5xFAD Tg-AD mice fed aluminum; and (2) in aluminum-supplemented animals, markers for inflammatory pathology appeared in both the brain and the retina as evidenced by an evolving presence of Abeta42 peptides, and accompanied by inflammatory markers - cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The results indicate that in the 5xFAD Tg-AD model aluminum not only enhances an Abeta42-mediated inflammatory degeneration of the brain but also appears to induce AD-type pathology in an anatomically-linked primary sensory area that involves vision.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) is causatively associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and N-terminally truncated and pyroglutamylated Abeta peptides (AbetapE) exert hypertoxic effect by an unknown mechanism. Recent evidence has identified the prefibrillar oligomers of Abeta, not the fibrils, as the prevalent cytotoxic species. Structural characterization of Abeta and AbetapE oligomers is therefore important for better understanding of their toxic effect. Here we have used isotope-edited Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to identify the conformational changes in Abeta(1-42) and AbetapE(3-42) upon aggregation, individually and in 1 : 1 molar combination. During the first two hours of exposure to aqueous buffer, the peptides undergo transition from mostly alpha-helical to mostly beta-sheet structure. Data on peptides (13)C,(15)N-labeled at K(16)L(17)V(18) or V(36)G(37)G(38)V(39) allowed construction of structural models for the monomer and early oligomers. The peptide monomer comprises a beta-hairpin that involves residues upstream of the K(16)L(17)V(18) sequence and an N-terminal alpha-helix. The oligomers form by non-H-bonding interactions between the beta-strands of neighboring beta-hairpins, in lateral or staggered manner, with the strands running parallel or antiparallel. Relative alpha-helical and beta-sheet propensities of Abeta(1-42) and AbetapE(3-42) depend on the ionic strength of the buffer, emphasizing the importance of ionic interactions in Abeta peptide structure and aggregation. It is inferred that N-terminal modification of AbetapE(3-42) affects the helix stability and thereby modulates beta-sheet oligomer formation. The data thus provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of Abeta oligomerization by emphasizing the role of the N-terminal transient alpha-helical structure and by identifying structural constraints for molecular organization of the oligomers.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, and innate immune cells have been shown to contribute to disease pathogenesis. In two transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease (5xFAD and 3xTg-AD mice), neutrophils extravasated and were present in areas with amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits, where they released neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and IL-17. Abeta42 peptide triggered the LFA-1 integrin high-affinity state and rapid neutrophil adhesion to integrin ligands. In vivo, LFA-1 integrin controlled neutrophil extravasation into the CNS and intraparenchymal motility. In transgenic Alzheimer's disease models, neutrophil depletion or inhibition of neutrophil trafficking via LFA-1 blockade reduced Alzheimer's disease-like neuropathology and improved memory in mice already showing cognitive dysfunction. Temporary depletion of neutrophils for 1 month at early stages of disease led to sustained improvements in memory. Transgenic Alzheimer's disease model mice lacking LFA-1 were protected from cognitive decline and had reduced gliosis. In humans with Alzheimer's disease, neutrophils adhered to and spread inside brain venules and were present in the parenchyma, along with NETs. Our results demonstrate that neutrophils contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and cognitive impairment and suggest that the inhibition of neutrophil trafficking may be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease.",

The importance of characterizing their aggregation has steadily increased because of their link to human diseases and material science applications. In particular, misfolding and aggregation of the Josephin domain of ataxin-3 is implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia-3. Infrared nanospectroscopy, simultaneously exploiting atomic force microscopy and infrared spectroscopy, can characterize at the nanoscale the conformational rearrangements of proteins during their aggregation. Here we demonstrate that we can individually characterize the oligomeric and fibrillar species formed along the amyloid aggregation. We describe their secondary structure, monitoring at the nanoscale an alpha-to-beta transition, and couple these studies with an independent measurement of the evolution of their intrinsic stiffness. These results suggest that the aggregation of Josephin proceeds from the monomer state to the formation of spheroidal intermediates with a native structure. Only successively, these intermediates evolve into misfolded aggregates and into the final fibrils.",

    "abstract": "PrP 106-126 conserves the pathogenic and physicochemical properties of the Scrapie isoform of the prion protein. PrP 106-126 and other amyloidal proteins are capable of inducing ion permeability through cell membranes, and this property may represent the common primary mechanism of pathogenesis in the amyloid-related degenerative diseases. However, for many amyloidal proteins, despite numerous phenomenological observations of their interactions with membranes, it has been difficult to determine the molecular mechanisms by which the proteins cause ion permeability. One approach that has not been undertaken is the kinetic study of protein-membrane interactions. We found that the reaction time constant of the interaction between PrP 106-126 and membranes is suitable for such studies. The kinetic experiment with giant lipid vesicles showed that the membrane area first increased by peptide binding but then decreased. The membrane area decrease was coincidental with appearance of extramembranous aggregates including lipid molecules. Sometimes, the membrane area would increase again followed by another decrease. The kinetic experiment with small vesicles was monitored by circular dichroism for peptide conformation changes. The results are consistent with a molecular simulation following a simple set of well-defined rules. We deduced that at the molecular level the formation of peptide amyloids incorporated lipid molecules as part of the aggregates. Most importantly the amyloid aggregates desorbed from the lipid bilayer, consistent with the macroscopic phenomena observed with giant vesicles. Thus we conclude that the main effect of membrane-mediated amyloid formation is extraction of lipid molecules from the membrane. We discuss the likelihood of this effect on membrane ion permeability.",

    "abstract": "Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial adult tumor. All Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)-associated meningiomas and ~60% of sporadic meningiomas show loss of NF2 tumor suppressor protein. There are no effective medical therapies for progressive and recurrent meningiomas. Our previous work demonstrated aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling that led to ongoing clinical trials with rapamycin analogs for NF2 and sporadic meningioma patients. Here we performed a high-throughput kinome screen to identify kinases responsible for mTORC1 pathway activation in NF2-deficient meningioma cells. Among the emerging top candidates were the mTORC2-specific target serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) and p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1). In NF2-deficient meningioma cells, inhibition of SGK1 rescues mTORC1 activation, and SGK1 activation is sensitive to dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD2014, but not to rapamycin. PAK1 inhibition also leads to attenuated mTORC1 but not mTORC2 signaling, suggesting that mTORC2/SGK1 and Rac1/PAK1 pathways are independently responsible for mTORC1 activation in NF2-deficient meningiomas. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we generated isogenic human arachnoidal cell lines (ACs), the origin cell type for meningiomas, expressing or lacking NF2. NF2-null CRISPR ACs recapitulate the signaling of NF2-deficient meningioma cells. Interestingly, we observe increased SGK1 transcription and protein expression in NF2-CRISPR ACs and in primary NF2-negative meningioma lines. Moreover, we demonstrate that the dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor, AZD2014 is superior to rapamycin and PAK inhibitor FRAX597 in blocking proliferation of meningioma cells. Importantly, AZD2014 is currently in use in several clinical trials of cancer. Therefore, we believe that AZD2014 may provide therapeutic advantage over rapalogs for recurrent and progressive meningiomas.",

In this study lysozyme prefibrillar oligomers and fibrils in both mature and sonicated states have been isolated through an optimized ultrafiltration/ultracentrifugation method and characterized with various optical spectroscopic techniques, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. We examined their level and mode of toxicity on rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells in both differentiated and undifferentiated states. We find that oligomers and fibrils display cytotoxic capabilities toward cultured cells in vitro, with oligomers producing elevated levels of cellular injury toward undifferentiated PC12 cells (PC12(undiff)). Furthermore, dual flow cytometry staining experiments demonstrate that the oligomers and mature fibrils induce divergent cellular death pathways (apoptosis and secondary necrosis, respectively) in these PC12 cells. We have also shown that oligomers but not sonicated mature fibrils inhibit hippocampal long term potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity implicated in learning and memory, in vivo. We conclude that our in vitro and in vivo findings confer a level of resistance toward amyloid fibrils, and that the PC 12-based comparative cytotoxicity assay can provide insights into toxicity differences between differently aggregated protein species.",

    "title": "TAR DNA-binding protein 43 and pathological subtype of Alzheimer's disease impact clinical features.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the frequency of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) differs across pathologically defined AD subtypes (hippocampal sparing [HpSp]; typical and limbic) and further examine the relationship between TDP-43, pathological subtype, and clinical features in AD. METHODS: We identified all cases with pathologically confirmed AD (NIA-Reagan intermediate-high probability, Braak stage IV-VI) independent of cognitive status (n = 188). Neurofibrillary tangle counts were performed using thioflavin-S microscopy in hippocampus and three neocortical regions, and all cases were subtyped: HpSp AD pathology (n = 19); typical AD pathology (n = 136); and limbic AD pathology (n = 33). TDP-43 immunoreactivity was performed in multiple brain regions to assess for the presence of TDP-43 and TDP-43 stage. All cases were clinically subclassified at presentation as amnestic AD dementia versus atypical AD dementia. Statistical analysis was performed using linear and penalized logistic regression to assess associations with pathological subtype, and the effects of TDP-43, accounting for possible interactions between pathological subtype and TDP-43. RESULTS: TDP-43 deposition was frequent in typical (59%) and limbic AD pathologies (67%), but not HpSp AD pathology (21%; p = 0.003). The observed associations of TDP-43 with greater memory loss, naming and functional decline, and smaller hippocampal volumes, closest to death, did not differ across AD pathological subtype. Clinical presentation was associated with pathological subtype (p = 0.01), but not TDP-43 (p = 0.69). INTERPRETATION: Although the frequency of TDP-43 deposition in AD varies by pathological subtype, the observed effects of TDP-43 on clinical/magnetic resonance imaging features are consistent across pathological subtypes. Clinical presentation in AD is driven by pathological subtype, not by TDP-43.",

    "title": "C-Terminally Truncated Forms of Tau, But Not Full-Length Tau or Its C-Terminal Fragments, Are Released from Neurons Independently of Cell Death.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Recent evidence suggests that tau aggregation may spread via extracellular release and subsequent uptake by synaptically connected neurons, but little is known about the processes by which tau is released or the molecular forms of extracellular tau. To gain insight into the nature of extracellular tau, we used highly sensitive ELISAs, which, when used in tandem, are capable of differentiating between full-length (FL) tau, mid-region-bearing fragments, and C-terminal (CT) fragments. We applied these assays to the systematic study of the conditioned media of N2a cells, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human cortical neurons, and primary rat cortical neurons, each of which was carefully assessed for viability. In all three neuronal models, the bulk of extracellular tau was free-floating and unaggregated and <0.2% was encapsulated in exosomes. Although most intracellular tau was FL, the majority of extracellular tau was CT truncated and appeared to be released both actively by living neurons and passively by dead cells. In contrast, only a small amount of extracellular tau was aggregation-competent tau (i.e., contained the microtubule-binding regions) and this material appears to be released solely due to a low level of cell death that occurs in all cell culture systems. Importantly, amyloid beta-protein (Abeta)-induced neuronal compromise significantly increased the quantity of all forms of extracellular tau, but the presence of Abeta before detectable cell compromise did not increase extracellular tau. Collectively, these results suggest that factors that induce neuronal death are likely to be necessary to initiate the extracellular spread of tau aggregation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Recent studies suggest that the transfer of tau between neurons underlies the characteristic spatiotemporal progression of neurofibrillary pathology. We searched for tau in the conditioned medium of N2a cells, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human cortical neurons, and primary rat cortical neurons and analyzed the material present using four different tau ELISAs. We demonstrate that the majority of tau released from healthy neurons is C-terminally truncated and lacks the microtubule-binding region (MTBR) thought necessary for self-aggregation. A small amount of MTBR-containing tau is present outside of cells, but this appears to be solely due to cell death. Therefore, if propagation of tau aggregation is mediated by extracellular tau, our findings suggest that neuronal compromise is required to facilitate this process.",

    "title": "An integrated multi-study analysis of intra-subject variability in cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta concentrations collected by lumbar puncture and indwelling lumbar catheter.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) has been investigated as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic drug target. Recent studies found that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta fluctuates over time, including as a diurnal pattern, and increases in absolute concentration with serial collection. It is currently unknown what effect differences in CSF collection methodology have on Abeta variability. In this study, we sought to determine the effect of different collection methodologies on the stability of CSF Abeta concentrations over time. METHODS: Grouped analysis of CSF Abeta levels from multiple industry and academic groups collected by either lumbar puncture (n=83) or indwelling lumbar catheter (n=178). Participants were either placebo or untreated subjects from clinical drug trials or observational studies. Participants had CSF collected by lumbar puncture or lumbar catheter for quantitation of Abeta concentration by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Data from all sponsors was converted to percent of the mean for Abeta40 and Abeta42 for comparison. Repeated measures analysis of variance was performed to assess for factors affecting the linear rise of Abeta concentrations over time. RESULTS: Analysis of studies collecting CSF via lumbar catheter revealed tremendous inter-subject variability of Abeta40 and Abeta42 as well as an Abeta diurnal pattern in all of the sponsors' studies. In contrast, Abeta concentrations from CSF samples collected at two time points by lumbar puncture showed no significant differences. Repeated measures analysis of variance found that only time and draw frequency were significantly associated with the slope of linear rise in Abeta40 and Abeta42 concentrations during the first 6 hours of collection. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we recommend minimizing the frequency of CSF draws in studies measuring Abeta levels and keeping the frequency standardized between experimental groups. The Abeta diurnal pattern was noted in all sponsors' studies and was not an artifact of study design. Averaging Abeta concentrations at each time point is recommended to minimize the effect of individual variability. Indwelling lumbar catheters are an invaluable research tool for following changes in CSF Abeta over 24-48 hours, but factors affecting Abeta concentration such as linear rise and diurnal variation need to be accounted for in planning study designs.",

    "abstract": "We examined the brains of 266 patients with prion disease (PrionD) and found that 46 patients (17%) had Alzheimer disease (AD)-like changes. To explore potential mechanistic links between PrionD and AD, we exposed human brain aggregates (BrnAggs) to a brain homogenate from a patient with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and found that neurons in human BrnAggs produced many beta-amyloid (Abeta; Abeta42) inclusions, whereas uninfected control-exposed human BrnAggs did not. Western blot analysis of 20 pooled Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease-infected BrnAggs verified Abeta42 levels higher than those in controls. We next examined the CA1 region of the hippocampus from 14 patients with PrionD and found that 5 patients had low levels of scrapie-associated prion protein (PrP), many Abeta42 intraneuronal inclusions, low apolipoprotein E-4 (APOE-4), and no significant nerve cell loss. Seven patients had high levels of PrP, low Abeta42, high APOE-4, and 40% nerve cell loss, suggesting that APOE-4 and PrP together cause neuron loss in PrionD. There were also increased levels of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (Htau) and Htau-positive neuropil threads and neuron bodies in both PrionD and AD groups. The brains of 6 age-matched control patients without dementia did not contain Abeta42 deposits; however, there were rare Htau-positive threads in 5 controls, and 2 controls had few Htau-positive nerve cell bodies. We conclude that PrionD may trigger biochemical changes similar to those triggered by AD and suggest that PrionD is a disease involving PrP, Abeta42, APOE-4, and abnormal tau.",

    "title": "Inhibiting amyloid beta-protein assembly: Size-activity relationships among grape seed-derived polyphenols.",
    "abstract": "Epidemiological evidence that red wine consumption negatively correlates with risk of Alzheimer's disease has led to experimental studies demonstrating that grape seed extracts inhibit the aggregation and oligomerization of Abeta in vitro and ameliorate neuropathology and behavioral deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The active agent in the extracts is a mixed population of polyphenolic compounds. To evaluate the relative potency of each of these compounds, HPLC was used to fractionate the mixture into monomers, dimers, and oligomers. Each fraction was analyzed for its effect on Abeta conformational dynamics (circular dichroism), oligomerization (zero-length photochemical cross-linking), aggregation kinetics (Thioflavin T fluorescence), and morphology (electron microscopy). The relative activities of each fraction were determined on the basis of molar concentration (mol/L) or mass concentration (g/L). When molar concentration, the number concentration of each polyphenolic compound, was considered, the oligomer fraction was the most potent inhibitor of Abeta oligomerization and aggregation. However, when mass concentration, the number concentration of phenolic groups, was considered, monomers were the most potent inhibitors. To understand these ostensibly contradictory results, a model of polyphenol:Abeta complexation was developed. This model, which was found to be consistent with published X-ray crystallographic studies, offers an explanation for the effects of functional group polyvalency on inhibitor activity. Our data emphasize the importance of an in-depth understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying 'concentration dependence' in inhibitor systems involving polyfunctional agents.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the fourth major cause of mortality in the elderly in the US and the leading cause of dementia worldwide. While pharmacological targets have been discovered, there are no true disease-modifying therapies. We have recently discovered that multiple low-dose infusions of human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBCs) ameliorate cognitive impairments and reduce Abeta-associated neuropathology in PSAPP transgenic mice. However, the mechanism for these effects of HUCBCs remains unclear. In the present study, we examined whether monocytes, as important components of HUCBCs, would have beneficial outcomes on the reduction of AD-like pathology and associated cognitive impairments in PSAPP transgenic AD model mice. PSAPP mice and their wild-type littermates were treated monthly with an infusion of peripheral human umbilical cord blood cell (HUCBC)-derived monocytes over a period of 2 and 4 months, followed by behavioral evaluations, biochemical, and histological analyses. The principal findings of the present study confirmed that monocytes derived from HUCBCs (CB-M) play a central role in HUCBC-mediated cognition-enhancing and Abeta pathology-ameliorating activities. Most importantly, we found that compared with CB-M, aged monocytes showed an ineffective phagocytosis of Abeta, while exogenous soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPPalpha) could reverse this deficiency. Pretreating monocytes with sAPPalpha upregulates Abeta internalization. Our further studies suggested that sAPPalpha could form a heterodimer with Abetas, with the APP672-688 (Abeta1-16) region being responsible for this effect. This in turn promoted binding of these heterodimers to monocyte scavenger receptors and thus promoted enhanced Abeta clearance. In summary, our findings suggest an interesting hypothesis that peripheral monocytes contribute to Abeta clearance through heterodimerization of sAPPalpha with Abeta. Further, declined or impaired sAPPalpha production, or reduced heterodimerization with Abeta, would cause a deficiency in Abeta clearance and thus accelerate the pathogenesis of AD.",

Many peptides that specifically target Abeta aggregates are known, encompassing efforts from both industrial and academic research settings. However, in clinical terms, not much success has been gained with peptide research; in turn, small drug-like molecules are already globally recognized as showing promise as an alternate approach. Abeta aggregation inhibitors are the most important part of the multifunctional drug design regimen for treating AD. Unfortunately, rational drug design approaches with small molecules are still in the initial stages. Herein we highlight, update, and elaborate on the structural anatomy of Abeta and known Abeta aggregation inhibitors in hopes of helping to optimize their use in structure-based drug design approaches toward inhibitors with greater specificity. Furthermore, we present the first review of efforts to target a previously uncharacterized region of acetylcholinesterase: the N-terminal 7-20 sub-region, which was experimentally elucidated to participate in Abeta aggregation and deposition.",

    "title": "Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibition prevents microglial plaque association and improves cognition in 3xTg-AD mice.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Microglia are dependent upon colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling for their survival in the adult brain, with administration of the dual CSF1R/c-kit inhibitor PLX3397 leading to the near-complete elimination of all microglia brainwide. Here, we determined the dose-dependent effects of a specific CSF1R inhibitor (PLX5622) on microglia in both wild-type and the 3xTg-AD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Wild-type mice were treated with PLX5622 for up to 21 days, and the effects on microglial numbers were assessed. 3xTg-AD mice were treated with PLX5622 for 6 or 12 weeks and effects on microglial numbers and pathology subsequently assessed. RESULTS: High doses of CSF1R inhibitor eliminate most microglia from the brain, but a 75% lower-dose results in sustained elimination of ~30 of microglia in both wild-type and 3xTg-AD mice. No behavioral or cognitive deficits were found in mice either depleted of microglia or treated with lower CSF1R inhibitor concentrations. Aged 3xTg-AD mice treated for 6 or 12 weeks with lower levels of PLX5622 resulted in improved learning and memory. Abeta levels and plaque loads were not altered, but microglia in treated mice no longer associated with plaques, revealing a role for the CSF1R in the microglial reaction to plaques, as well as in mediating cognitive deficits. CONCLUSIONS: We find that inhibition of CSF1R alone is sufficient to eliminate microglia and that sustained microglial elimination is concentration-dependent. Inhibition of the CSF1R at lower levels in 3xTg-AD mice prevents microglial association with plaques and improves cognition.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains exhibit plaques and tangles in association with inflammation. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abl is linked to neuro-inflammation in AD. Abl inhibition by nilotinib or bosutinib facilitates amyloid clearance and may decrease inflammation. Transgenic mice that express Dutch, Iowa and Swedish APP mutations (TgAPP) and display progressive Abeta plaque deposition were treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to determine pre-plaque effects on systemic and CNS inflammation using milliplex  ELISA. Plaque Abeta was detected at 4months in TgAPP and pre-plaque intracellular Abeta accumulation (2.5months) was associated with changes of cytokines and chemokines prior to detection of glial changes. Plaque formation correlated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta) and markers of immunosuppressive and adaptive immunity, including, IL-4, IL-10, IL-2, IL-3, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and IFN-gamma. An inverse relationship of chemokines was observed as CCL2 and CCL5 were lower than WT mice at 2months and significantly increased after plaque appearance, while soluble CX3CL1 decreased. A change in glial profile was only robustly detected at 6months in Tg-APP mice and TKIs reduced astrocyte and dendritic cell number with no effects on microglia, suggesting alteration of brain immunity. Nilotinib decreased blood and brain cytokines and chemokines and increased CX3CL1. Bosutinib increased brain and blood IL-10 and CX3CL1, suggesting a protective role for soluble CX3CL1. Taken together these data suggest that TKIs regulate systemic and CNS immunity and may be useful treatments in early AD through dual effects on amyloid clearance and immune modulation.",

    "title": "Molecular Mechanisms of Alzheimer's Biomarker FDDNP Binding to Abeta Amyloid Fibril.",
    "abstract": "Using isobaric-isothermal replica exchange molecular dynamics and the all-atom explicit water model, we examined the binding of FDDNP biomarkers to the Abeta amyloid fibril fragment. Our results can be summarized as follows. First, FDDNP ligands bind with high affinity to the Abeta fibril, and the hydrophobic effect together with pi-stacking interactions are the dominant factors governing FDDNP binding. In comparison, electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding play a minor role. Second, our simulations reveal a strong tendency of bound FDDNP molecules for self-aggregation. Accordingly, about two-thirds of all bound ligands form aggregated clusters of various sizes, and ligand-ligand interactions make considerable contribution to FDDNP binding. Third, FDDNP ligands bind to two distinct sites on the Abeta fibril. Primary binding sites (NT) are located at the N-terminals of Abeta10-40 peptides, whereas secondary ones (CE) occur on the concave fibril edge near fibril channels. The NT sites are characterized by strong hydrophobic and pi-stacking interactions, favorable binding entropy resulting from multiple FDDNP binding orientations and propensity for self-aggregation but relatively weak van der Waals interactions. In contrast, the CE sites offer stronger van der Waals binding interactions but weaker hydrophobic and aromatic interactions and less favorable binding entropy. By comparing our data with previous studies, we suggest that the primary binding locations identified by us are likely to occur in other Abeta fibril polymorphic structures. We also show that FDDNP binds via distinct mechanisms to Abeta fibrils and monomers. We argue that FDDNP binds with stronger affinity to benign Abeta monomers than to the fibrils, raising questions about the ability of FDDNP to selectively label amyloid deposits.",

Primary findings for both studies have been published. METHODS: Secondary analyses of efficacy, biomarker, and safety endpoints in the pooled (EXPEDTION + EXPEDITION2) mild AD population were performed. RESULTS: In the mild AD population, less cognitive and functional decline was observed with solanezumab (n = 659) versus placebo (n = 663), measured by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living functional scale Instrumental ADLs. Baseline-to-endpoint changes did not differ between treatment groups for Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living functional scale, basic items of the ADCS-ADL, and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes. Plasma/cerebrospinal fluid biomarker findings indicated target engagement by solanezumab. Solanezumab demonstrated acceptable safety. Efficacy findings for the moderate AD population are also provided. DISCUSSION: These findings describe solanezumab effects on efficacy/safety measures in a mild AD population. Another phase 3 study, EXPEDITION3, will investigate solanezumab's effects in a mild AD population.",

The variant also was related to longevity in the Icelandic population. However, because of the extreme rarity of A673T in non-Nordic populations, the association with Alzheimer's disease has not yet been formally replicated. Because the variant has not been reported among the Danes, we aimed to study its frequency among healthy middle-age twins and oldest-old singletons and explore the possible effects on longevity and cognitive abilities. Surprisingly, only 1 of 3487 unrelated Danes carried the A673T variant, (0.014% [95% CI 0.000-0.080]), which was significantly lower than in the other Nordic countries averaging to 0.43% (95% CI 0.40-0.46).

    "title": "Design and Characterization of Chemically Stabilized Abeta42 Oligomers.",
    "abstract": "A popular working hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease causation is amyloid beta-protein oligomers are the key neuropathogenetic agents. Rigorously elucidating the role of oligomers requires the production of stable oligomers of each size. We previously used zero-length photochemical cross-linking to allow stabilization, isolation, and determination of structure-activity relationships of pure populations of Abeta40 dimers, trimers, and tetramers. We also attempted to study Abeta42 but found that Abeta42 oligomers subjected to the same procedures were not completely stable. On the basis of the fact that Tyr is a critical residue in cross-linking chemistry, we reasoned that the chemical accessibility of Tyr10 in Abeta42 must differ from that in Abeta40. We thus chemically synthesized four singly substituted Tyr variants that placed the Tyr in different positions across the Abeta42 sequence. We then studied the stability of the resulting cross-linked oligomers as well as procedures for fractionating the oligomers to obtain pure populations of different sizes. We found that [Phe(10),Tyr(42)]Abeta42 produced stable oligomers yielding highly pure populations of dimers through heptamers. This provides the means to establish formal structure-activity relationships of these important Abeta42 assemblies. In addition, we were able to analyze the dissociation patterns of non-cross-linked oligomers to produce a model for oligomer formation. This work is relevant to the determination of structure-activity relationships that have the potential to provide mechanistic insights into disease pathogenesis.",

Studies of Alzheimer disease biomarkers have largely focused on Abeta in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and there is uncertainty as to what plasma Abeta may be a marker. We examined the association of Abeta levels in the plasma with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-markers of brain aging, including longitudinal changes in global and regional brain volumes, in dementia-free persons. We studied 1530 participants of the Three-City-Dijon cohort, aged 65-80 years. Plasma Abeta measurement and magnetic resonance imaging were performed at baseline and after a 4-year follow up. Total brain, gray matter, and hippocampal volume were estimated using voxel-based morphometry, and annualized change in brain volumes was calculated. Increased plasma Abeta1-40 was associated with lower baseline hippocampal volume. Although baseline plasma Abeta levels were not associated with longitudinal change in brain volumes, consistently high plasma Abeta1-40 levels were associated with faster total brain atrophy and consistently low plasma Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio, with increased total brain atrophy and gray matter atrophy. In dementia-free older adults, high plasma Abeta1-40 and low plasma Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio were associated with smaller hippocampal volume and accelerated global and regional brain atrophy respectively.",

It is thought that this risk is conferred by the presence of three copies of the gene encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP)--an Alzheimer disease risk factor--although the possession of extra copies of other chromosome 21 genes may also play a part. Further study of the mechanisms underlying the development of Alzheimer disease in people with Down syndrome could provide insights into the mechanisms that cause dementia in the general population.",

    "abstract": "Oligomeric states of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) appear to be causally related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, two familial mutations in the amyloid precursor protein gene have been described, both resulting in amino acid substitutions at Ala2 (A2) within Abeta. An A2V mutation causes autosomal recessive early onset AD. Interestingly, heterozygotes enjoy some protection against development of the disease. An A2T substitution protects against AD and age-related cognitive decline in non-AD patients. Here, we use ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) to examine the effects of these mutations on Abeta assembly. These studies reveal different assembly pathways for early oligomer formation for each peptide. A2T Abeta42 formed dimers, tetramers, and hexamers, but dodecamer formation was inhibited. In contrast, no significant effects on Abeta40 assembly were observed. A2V Abeta42 also formed dimers, tetramers, and hexamers, but it did not form dodecamers. However, A2V Abeta42 formed trimers, unlike A2T or wild-type (wt) Abeta42. In addition, the A2V substitution caused Abeta40 to oligomerize similar to that of wt Abeta42, as evidenced by the formation of dimers, tetramers, hexamers, and dodecamers. In contrast, wt Abeta40 formed only dimers and tetramers. These results provide a basis for understanding how these two mutations lead to, or protect against, AD. They also suggest that the Abeta N-terminus, in addition to the oft discussed central hydrophobic cluster and C-terminus, can play a key role in controlling disease susceptibility.",

    "title": "The Effect of Body Posture on Brain Glymphatic Transport.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The glymphatic pathway expedites clearance of waste, including soluble amyloid beta (Abeta) from the brain. Transport through this pathway is controlled by the brain's arousal level because, during sleep or anesthesia, the brain's interstitial space volume expands (compared with wakefulness), resulting in faster waste removal. Humans, as well as animals, exhibit different body postures during sleep, which may also affect waste removal. Therefore, not only the level of consciousness, but also body posture, might affect CSF-interstitial fluid (ISF) exchange efficiency. We used dynamic-contrast-enhanced MRI and kinetic modeling to quantify CSF-ISF exchange rates in anesthetized rodents' brains in supine, prone, or lateral positions. To validate the MRI data and to assess specifically the influence of body posture on clearance of Abeta, we used fluorescence microscopy and radioactive tracers, respectively. The analysis showed that glymphatic transport was most efficient in the lateral position compared with the supine or prone positions. In the prone position, in which the rat's head was in the most upright position (mimicking posture during the awake state), transport was characterized by \"retention\" of the tracer, slower clearance, and more CSF efflux along larger caliber cervical vessels. The optical imaging and radiotracer studies confirmed that glymphatic transport and Abeta clearance were superior in the lateral and supine positions. We propose that the most popular sleep posture (lateral) has evolved to optimize waste removal during sleep and that posture must be considered in diagnostic imaging procedures developed in the future to assess CSF-ISF transport in humans. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The rodent brain removes waste better during sleep or anesthesia compared with the awake state. Animals exhibit different body posture during the awake and sleep states, which might affect the brain's waste removal efficiency. We investigated the influence of body posture on brainwide transport of inert tracers of anesthetized rodents. The major finding of our study was that waste, including Abeta, removal was most efficient in the lateral position (compared with the prone position), which mimics the natural resting/sleeping position of rodents. Although our finding awaits testing in humans, we speculate that the lateral position during sleep has advantage with regard to the removal of waste products including Abeta, because clinical studies have shown that sleep drives Abeta clearance from the brain.",

The characterization of canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome has been restricted to selected laboratory dogs and mongrels, thereby limiting our knowledge of potential breed-related and age-related differences. We examined the brains of 24 dogs from various breeds. The frontal cortex, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex were investigated. Deposits of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau were analyzed phenotypically and quantified stereologically. In all dogs aged 10 years or older, plaques containing pyroglutamyl Abeta and Abeta8-17 were detected. Within the ventral hippocampus, significantly more pyroglutamyl Abeta plaques were deposited in small and medium dogs than in large dogs. Hyperphosphorylated tau with formation of neurofibrillary tangles was observed in 3 animals aged 13 to 15 years. This study provides the first investigation of pyroglutamyl Abeta in comparison with total Abeta (as shown by Abeta8-17 immunoreactivity) in dogs of different breeds, sizes, and ages. Our results indicate that canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome is relatively common among aged canines, thereby emphasizing the relevance of such populations to translational Alzheimer disease research.",

Hence, regulation of meprin activity might be a suitable strategy for the treatment of these conditions. Meprin beta is a type 1 transmembrane protein, but can be released from the cell surface by ectodomain shedding. The protease is expressed as an inactive zymogen and requires proteolytic maturation by tryptic serine proteases. In the present study, we demonstrate, for the first time, the differences in the activation of soluble and membrane bound meprin beta and suggest transmembrane serine protease 6 [TMPRSS6 or matriptase-2 (MT2)] as a new potent activator, cleaving off the propeptide of meprin beta between Arg(61) and Asn(62) as determined by MS. We show that MT2, but not TMPRSS4 or pancreatic trypsin, is capable of activating full-length meprin beta at the cell surface, analysed by specific fluorogenic peptide cleavage assay, Western blotting and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Maturation of full-length meprin beta is required for its activity as a cell surface sheddase, releasing the ectodomains of transmembrane proteins, as previously shown for the amyloid precursor protein (APP).",

The \"beta-amyloid cascade hypothesis\" of AD is the basis of current understanding of AD pathogenesis and drug discovery. However, no AD models have fully validated this hypothesis. We recently developed a human stem cell culture model of AD by cultivating genetically modified human neural stem cells in a three-dimensional (3D) cell culture system. These cells were able to recapitulate key events of AD pathology including beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In this review, we will discuss the progress and current limitations of AD mouse models and human stem cell models as well as explore the breakthroughs of 3D cell culture systems. We will also share our perspective on the potential of dish models of neurodegenerative diseases for studying pathogenic cascades and therapeutic drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of insoluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). As essential tremor (ET) could involve neurodegenerative processes in the cerebellum, we quantified soluble and insoluble Abeta in cerebellar cortices from patients diagnosed with ET (n=9), compared to Controls (n=16) or individuals with Parkinson's disease (n=10). Although ante-mortem cognitive performance was not documented, all individuals included had the diagnosis of AD ruled out by a neuropathologist. ELISA-determined concentrations of insoluble Abeta42 in ET patients displayed a bimodal distribution, with a median 246-fold higher than in Controls (P<0.01, Kruskal-Wallis). Higher Abeta42 concentrations were measured in the parietal cortex of the same ET patients, compared to Controls (107-fold median increase, P<0.01, Kruskal-Wallis), but similar phosphorylated tau levels were detected. The rise in cerebellar insoluble Abeta42 concentrations is not associated to APP expression and processing or the ApoE4 status. However, Abeta42 levels in ET individuals were correlated with cerebellar insoluble phosphorylated tau (r(2)=0.71, P=0.005), unphosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H; r(2)=0.50, P=0.030) and Lingo-1 (r(2)=0.73, P=0.007), indicative of a generalized neurodegenerative process involving the cerebellum. Our results suggest prevalent accumulations of insoluble Abeta42 in the cerebellum of ET, but not in age-matched PD. Whether this anomaly plays a role in ET symptoms warrants further investigations.",

The in vitro results showed that LMWCS blocked Abeta25-35-induced cell viability loss and apoptosis, decreased intracellular calcium concentration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization, and the protein expression of Caspase-3. During in vivo experiments, LMWCS improved the cognitive impairment induced by Abeta1-40, increased the level of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and decreased the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the mouse brain. Moreover, LMWCS decreased the density of pyramidal cells of CA1 regions, and suppressed the protein expression of Bax/Bcl-2 and Caspase-3, -9 in the hippocampus of mice. In conclusion, LMWCS possessed neuroprotective properties against toxic effects induced by Abeta peptides both in vitro and in vivo, which might be related to anti-apoptotic activity. LMWCS might be a useful preventive and therapeutic compound for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Dynamics of protein aggregation and oligomer formation governed by secondary nucleation.",
    "abstract": "The formation of aggregates in many protein systems can be significantly accelerated by secondary nucleation, a process where existing assemblies catalyse the nucleation of new species. In particular, secondary nucleation has emerged as a central process controlling the proliferation of many filamentous protein structures, including molecular species related to diseases such as sickle cell anemia and a range of neurodegenerative conditions. Increasing evidence suggests that the physical size of protein filaments plays a key role in determining their potential for deleterious interactions with living cells, with smaller aggregates of misfolded proteins, oligomers, being particularly toxic. It is thus crucial to progress towards an understanding of the factors that control the sizes of protein aggregates. However, the influence of secondary nucleation on the time evolution of aggregate size distributions has been challenging to quantify. This difficulty originates in large part from the fact that secondary nucleation couples the dynamics of species distant in size space. Here, we approach this problem by presenting an analytical treatment of the master equation describing the growth kinetics of linear protein structures proliferating through secondary nucleation and provide closed-form expressions for the temporal evolution of the resulting aggregate size distribution. We show how the availability of analytical solutions for the full filament distribution allows us to identify the key physical parameters that control the sizes of growing protein filaments. Furthermore, we use these results to probe the dynamics of the populations of small oligomeric species as they are formed through secondary nucleation and discuss the implications of our work for understanding the factors that promote or curtail the production of these species with a potentially high deleterious biological activity.",

    "abstract": "We have explored the potential neuroprotective effect of local lentiviraly-mediated overexpression of nerve growth factor (NGF) on in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat hippocampus under pathological conditions. The suspension of lentiviral particles was prepared using a genetic construct containing the human NGF gene under the control of a neuron-specific CaMKII promoter. Two weeks after the viral injection NGF concentration in the hippocampus doubled. In vivo recordings of total electrical activity in the dentate gyrus were performed. While the increased expression of NGF did not affect the amplitude of evoked postsynaptic potentials recorded after a high-frequency stimulation of the perforant path, it prevented the LTP decline induced by the i.c.v. administration of 50 nM beta-amyloid (25-35) 1h prior to tetanization. Our results demonstrate that increased endogenous NGF concentration can rescue hippocampal neuronal function from beta-amyloid peptide induced impairment.",

    "abstract": "Oligomeric Abeta42 aggregates have been identified as one of the major neurotoxic components of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immunotherapy targeted against these Abeta42 aggregates has been proposed as an appropriate therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD. Here, we report an anti-oligomeric Abeta42 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody, named MO6, obtained from the human antibody library of a healthy donor. ScFv MO6 specifically recognized and bound to the oligomeric Abeta42 (Abeta42 oligomers and immature protofibrils; 18-37 kDa), and reduced their levels mainly by blocking their formation, although scFv MO6 also induced disaggregation of Abeta42 aggregates. More importantly, scFv MO6 ameliorated or attenuated Abeta42-induced cytotoxicity and increased cell viability by up to 33%. Furthermore, scFv MO6 efficiently passed through an in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) model with a delivery efficiency of 66% after 60 min post-administration. ScFv MO6 is a monovalent antibody with an affinity constant (KD) of 5.2x10(-6) M for Abeta42 oligomers. Molecular docking simulations of Abeta42 to scFv MO6 revealed that the approach and specific binding of scFv MO6 to oligomeric Abeta42 aggregates was achieved by conformational recognition and directed induction, which resulted in a more dynamic adaptation of Abeta42 to scFv MO6, occurring mainly in the N-terminal (3-4), middle (12-19) and C-terminal (34-42) regions of Abeta42. This binding mode of scFv MO6 to Abeta42 explains its protective effects against oligomeric Abeta42. Our findings may be applied for the design of a smaller antibody specific for Abeta42 oligermers.",

Their typically low abundance and highly heterogeneous nature, however, make such species challenging to study using traditional biochemical techniques. By combining fast-flow microfluidics with single-molecule fluorescence, we are able to rapidly follow the process by which oligomers of alphaS are formed and to characterize the species themselves. We have used the technique to show that populations of oligomers with different FRET efficiencies have varying stabilities when diluted into low ionic strength solutions. Interestingly, we have found that oligomers formed early in the aggregation pathway have electrostatic repulsions that are shielded in the high ionic strength buffer and therefore dissociate when diluted into lower ionic strength solutions. This property can be used to isolate different structural groups of alphaS oligomers and can help to rationalize some aspects of alphaS amyloid fibril formation.",

In vivo biomarkers for disease processes in PD are important for future development of disease-modifying therapies. OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of a panel of CSF biomarkers in patients with early PD and related disorders. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Regional population-based, prospective cohort study of idiopathic parkinsonism that included patients diagnosed between January 1, 2004, and April 30, 2009, by a movement disorder team at a university hospital that represented the only neurology clinic in the region. Participants were 128 nondemented patients with new-onset parkinsonism (104 with PD, 11 with multiple system atrophy, and 13 with progressive supranuclear palsy) who were followed up for 5 to 9 years. At baseline, CSF from 30 healthy control participants was obtained for comparison. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of neurofilament light chain protein, Abeta1-42, total tau, phosphorylated tau, alpha-synuclein, and heart fatty acid-binding protein were quantified by 2 blinded measurements (at baseline and after 1 year). Follow-up included an extensive neuropsychological assessment. As PD outcome variables, mild cognitive impairment and incident PDD were diagnosed based on published criteria. RESULTS: Among the 128 study participants, the 104 patients with early PD had a different CSF pattern compared with the 13 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (baseline area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.87; P < .0001) and the 30 control participants (baseline area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.69; P = .0021). A CSF biomarker pattern associated with the development of PDD was observed. In PD, high neurofilament light chain protein, low Abeta1-42, and high heart fatty acid-binding protein at baseline were related to future PDD as analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression models. Combined, these early biomarkers predicted PDD with high accuracy (hazard ratio, 11.8; 95% CI, 3.3-42.1; P = .0001) after adjusting for possible confounders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The analyzed CSF biomarkers have potential usefulness as a diagnostic tool in patients with parkinsonism. In PD, high neurofilament light chain protein, low Abeta1-42, and high heart fatty acid-binding protein were related to future PDD, providing new insights into the etiology of PDD.",

In particular, the ganglioside GM1, present with cholesterol in lipid rafts, seems to be able to initiate Abeta aggregation on membrane. We studied the thermodynamic and structural effects of the presence of GM1 on the interaction between Abeta and liposomes, a good membrane model system. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry highlighted the importance of the presence of GM1 in recruiting monomeric Abeta toward the lipid bilayer. Light and Small Angle X-ray Scattering revealed a different pattern for GM1 containing liposomes, both before and after interaction with Abeta. The results suggest that the interaction with GM1 brings to insertion of Abeta in the bilayer, producing a structural perturbation down to the internal layers of the liposome, as demonstrated by the obtained electron density profiles.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes, the main element of the homeostatic system in the brain, are affected in various neurological conditions including Alzheimer's disease (AD). A common astrocytic reaction in pathological state is known as astrocytosis which is characterized by a specific change in astrocyte shape due to cytoskeletal remodeling, cytokine secretion and cellular proliferation. Astrocytes also undergo apoptosis in various neurological conditions or in response to toxic insults. AD is pathologically characterized by progressive deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in senile plaques, intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic dysfunction and neuron death. Astrocytosis and astrocyte death have been reported in AD brain as well as in response to Abeta in vitro. However, how astrocytes undergo both proliferation and death in response to Abeta remains elusive. In this study, we used primary cultures of cortical astrocytes and exposed them to various doses of oligomeric Abeta. We found that cultured astrocytes proliferate and manifest all signs of astrocytosis at a low dose of Abeta. However, at high dose of Abeta the activated astrocytes undergo apoptosis. Astrocytosis was also noticed in vivo in response to Abeta in the rat brain. Next, we investigated the mechanism of astrocyte apoptosis in response to a high dose of Abeta. We found that death of astrocyte induced by Abeta requires a set of molecules that are instrumental for neuron death in response to Abeta. It involves activation of Forkhead transcription factor Foxo3a, induction of its pro-apoptotic target Bim and activation of its downstream molecule, caspase3. Hence, this study demonstrates that the concentration of Abeta decides whether astrocytes do proliferate or undergo apoptosis via a mechanism that is required for neuron death.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) positions tau protein as a downstream mediator of beta-amyloid (Abeta) toxicity This is largely based on genetic cross breeding, which showed that tau ablation in young (3-7-month-old) transgenic mice overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) abolished the phenotype of the APP AD model. This evidence is complicated by the uncertain impact of overexpressing mutant APP, rather than Abeta alone, and for potential interactions between tau and overexpressed APP. Cortical iron elevation is also implicated in AD, and tau promotes iron export by trafficking APP to the neuronal surface. Here, we utilized an alternative model of Abeta toxicity by directly injecting Abeta oligomers into the hippocampus of young and old wild-type and tau knockout mice. We found that ablation of tau protected against Abeta-induced cognitive impairment, hippocampal neuron loss, and iron accumulation. Despite injected human Abeta being eliminated after 5 weeks, enduring changes, including increased APP levels, tau reduction, tau phosphorylation, and iron accumulation, were observed. While the results from our study support the amyloid cascade hypothesis, they also suggest that downstream effectors of Abeta, which propagate toxicity after Abeta has been cleared, may be tractable therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "The ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) has been identified as a susceptibility factor of late onset Alzheimer disease in genome-wide association studies. ABCA7 has been shown to mediate phagocytosis and affect membrane trafficking. The current study examined the impact of ABCA7 loss of function on amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and generation of amyloid-beta (Abeta). Suppression of endogenous ABCA7 in several different cell lines resulted in increased beta-secretase cleavage and elevated Abeta. ABCA7 knock-out mice displayed an increased production of endogenous murine amyloid Abeta42 species. Crossing ABCA7-deficient animals to an APP transgenic model resulted in significant increases in the soluble Abeta as compared with mice expressing normal levels of ABCA7. Only modest changes in the amount of insoluble Abeta and amyloid plaque densities were observed once the amyloid pathology was well developed, whereas Abeta deposition was enhanced in younger animals. In vitro studies indicated a more rapid endocytosis of APP in ABCA7 knock-out cells that is mechanistically consistent with the increased Abeta production. These in vitro and in vivo findings indicate a direct role of ABCA7 in amyloid processing that may be associated with its primary biological function to regulate endocytic pathways. Several potential loss-of-function ABCA7 mutations and deletions linked to Alzheimer disease that in some instances have a greater impact than apoE allelic variants have recently been identified. A reduction in ABCA7 expression or loss of function would be predicted to increase amyloid production and that may be a contributing factor in the associated Alzheimer disease susceptibility.",

In this work, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated a series of near-infrared (NIR) probes with electron donor-acceptor end groups interacting through a pi-conjugated system for the detection of Abeta deposits in the brain. Among these probes, 3b and 3c had excellent fluorescent properties (emission maxima > 650 nm and high quantum yields) and displayed high sensitivity and high affinities to Abeta aggregates (3b, Kd = 8.8 nM; 3c, Kd = 1.9 nM). Both 3b and 3c could readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier with high initial brain uptake and fast to moderate washout from the brain. In vivo NIR imaging revealed that 3b and 3c could efficiently differentiate transgenic and wild-type mice. In summary, our research provides new hints for developing smarter and more activatable NIR probes targeting Abeta.",

    "abstract": "Although metabolic syndrome was suggested to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the role of metabolic stress in the initiation of AD pathology remains unclear. In this study, metabolic stress was induced by a high-fat diet and low-dose injection of streptozotocin (HFSTZ) before the appearance of senile plaques in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. We found that, HFSTZ treatment exacerbated amyloid beta burden and astrocyte activation in the vicinity of plaques. Moreover, we observed an upregulation of astrocytic S100B expression in the brain parenchyma of HFSTZ-treated APP/PS1 mice concurrent with increased interleukin-6 expression in cerebral microvascular cells. To determine the impact of HFSTZ treatment on brain function, we performed [(18)F]fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and analyzed nesting behavior. HFSTZ treatment impaired nest construction and cerebral glucose metabolism in several brain regions of APP/PS1 mice during the early stage of AD. These results suggest that HFSTZ-induced peripheral metabolic stress may contribute to vascular inflammation and astrocyte reactivity in the parenchyma and may impair activity of daily living skill and cerebral glucose metabolism in APP/PS1 mice.",

    "abstract": "Detecting deposits of amyloid beta fibrils in the brain is of paramount importance for an early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. A number of PET tracers have been developed for amyloid imaging, but many suffer from poor specificity and large signal to background ratio. Design of tracers with specificity and improved binding affinity requires knowledge about various potential binding sites in the amyloid beta fibril available for the tracers and the nature of the local microenvironment of these sites. In this study we investigate the local structure of fibrils using two important probes, namely, thioflavin T (a fluorescent probe) and AZD2184 (a PET tracer). The target structures for amyloid-beta(1-42) fibril are based on reported NMR solution models. By explicitly considering the effect of fibril flexibility on the available binding sites for all these models, the binding affinity of these probes has been investigated. The binding profiles of AZD2184 and thioflavin T were studied by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation methods. The two compounds were found to bind at the same sites of the fibril: three of which are within the fibril, and one is on the two sides of the Met35 residue on the surface. The binding affinity of AZD2184 and thioflavin T is found to be higher at the core sites than on the surface due to more contact residues. The binding affinity of AZD2184 is much higher than that of thioflavin T at every site due to electrostatic interaction and spatial restriction, which is in good agreement with experimental observation. However, the structural change of thioflavin T is much more significant than that of AZD2184, which is the chemical basis for its usage as a fluorescent probe. The ramifications of these results for the design and optimization of PET radioligands and fluorescent probes are briefly discussed.",

    "title": "Defective Age-Dependent Metaplasticity in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Much of the molecular understanding of synaptic pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) comes from studies of various mouse models that express familial AD (FAD)-linked mutations, often in combinations. Most studies compare the absolute magnitudes of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) to assess deficits in bidirectional synaptic plasticity accompanying FAD-linked mutations. However, LTP and LTD are not static, but their induction threshold is adjusted by overall neural activity via metaplasticity. Hence LTP/LTD changes in AD mouse models may reflect defects in metaplasticity processes. To determine this, we examined the LTP/LTD induction threshold in APPswe;PS1DeltaE9 transgenic (Tg) mice across two different ages. We found that in young Tg mice (1 month), LTP is enhanced at the expense of LTD, but in adults (6 months), the phenotype is reversed to promote LTD and reduce LTP, compared to age-matched wild-type (WT) littermates. The apparent opposite phenotype across age was due to an initial offset in the induction threshold to favor LTP and the inability to undergo developmental metaplasticity in Tg mice. In WTs, the synaptic modification threshold decreased over development to favor LTP and diminish LTD in adults. However, in Tg mice, the magnitudes of LTP and LTD stayed constant across development. The initial offset in LTP/LTD threshold in young Tg mice did not accompany changes in the LTP/LTD induction mechanisms, but altered AMPA receptor phosphorylation and appearance of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors. We propose that the main synaptic defect in AD mouse models is due to their inability to undergo developmental metaplasticity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This work offers a new insight that metaplasticity defects are central to synaptic dysfunctions seen in AD mouse models. In particular, we demonstrate that the apparent differences in LTP/LTD magnitude seen across ages in AD transgenic mouse models reflect the inability to undergo a normal developmental shift in metaplasticity.",

Graphene oxide (GO) and its derivatives have shown to modulate the aggregation pattern of disease causing amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide. However, the mechanism is still not well understood. Using molecular dynamics simulations, the effect of graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) having carbon:oxygen ratio of 4:1 and 10:1, respectively, on the conformational transitions (alpha-helix to beta-sheet) and the dynamics of the peptide was investigated. GO and rGO decreased the beta-strand propensity of amino acid residues in Abeta. The peptide displayed different modes of adsorption on GO and rGO. The adsorption on GO was dominated by electrostatic interactions, whereas on rGO, both van der Waals and electrostatic interactions contributed in the adsorption of the peptide. Our study revealed that the slight increase in the hydrophobic patches on rGO made it more effective inhibitor of conformational transitions in the peptide. Alpha helix-beta sheet transition in Abeta peptide could be one of the plausible mechanism by which graphene oxide may inhibit amyloid fibrillation.",

    "title": "Comparison of Visual and Quantitative Florbetapir F 18 Positron Emission Tomography Analysis in Predicting Mild Cognitive Impairment Outcomes.",
    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The applicability of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) positron emission tomography (PET) as a biomarker in clinical settings to aid in selection of individuals at preclinical and prodromal Alzheimer disease (AD) will depend on the practicality of PET image analysis. In this context, visual-based Abeta PET assessment seems to be the most feasible approach. OBJECTIVES: To determine the agreement between visual and quantitative Abeta PET analysis and to assess the ability of both techniques to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A longitudinal study was conducted among the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) sites in the United States and Canada during a 1.6-year mean follow-up period. The study was performed from September 21, 2010, to August 11, 2014; data analysis was conducted from September 21, 2014, to May 26, 2015. Participants included 401 individuals with MCI receiving care at a specialty clinic (219 [54.6%] men; mean [SD] age, 71.6 [7.5] years; 16.2 [2.7] years of education). All participants were studied with florbetapir F 18 [18F] PET. The standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) positivity threshold was 1.11, and one reader rated all images, with a subset of 125 scans rated by a second reader. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sensitivity and specificity of positive and negative [18F] florbetapir PET categorization, which was estimated with cerebrospinal fluid Abeta1-42 as the reference standard. Risk for conversion to AD was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: The frequency of Abeta positivity was 48.9% (196 patients; visual analysis), 55.1% (221 patients; SUVR), and 64.8% (166 patients; cerebrospinal fluid), yielding substantial agreement between visual and SUVR data (kappa = 0.74) and between all methods (Fleiss kappa = 0.71). For approximately 10% of the 401 participants in whom visual and SUVR data disagreed, interrater reliability was moderate (kappa = 0.44), but it was very high if visual and quantitative results agreed (kappa = 0.92). Visual analysis had a lower sensitivity (79% vs 85%) but higher specificity (96% vs 90%), respectively, compared with SUVR. The conversion rate was 15.2% within a mean of 1.6 years, and a positive [18F] florbetapir baseline scan was associated with a 6.91-fold (SUVR) or 11.38-fold (visual) greater hazard for AD conversion, which changed only modestly after covariate adjustment for apolipoprotein epsilon4, concurrent fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET scan, and baseline cognitive status. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Visual and SUVR Abeta PET analysis may be equivalently used to determine Abeta status for individuals with MCI participating in clinical trials, and both approaches add significant value for clinical course prognostication.",

    "abstract": "An increase in amyloid-beta (Abeta) production is a major pathogenic mechanism associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but little is known about possible homeostatic control of the amyloidogenic pathway. Here we report that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD) downregulates Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-family verprolin homologous protein 1 (WAVE1 or WASF1) as part of a negative feedback mechanism to limit Abeta production. The AICD binds to the Wasf1 promoter, negatively regulates its transcription and downregulates Wasf1 mRNA and protein expression in Neuro 2a (N2a) cells. WAVE1 interacts and colocalizes with APP in the Golgi apparatus. Experimentally reducing WAVE1 in N2a cells decreased the budding of APP-containing vesicles and reduced cell-surface APP, thereby reducing the production of Abeta. WAVE1 downregulation was observed in mouse models of AD. Reduction of Wasf1 gene expression dramatically reduced Abeta levels and restored memory deficits in a mouse model of AD. A decrease in amounts of WASF1 mRNA was also observed in human AD brains, suggesting clinical relevance of the negative feedback circuit involved in homeostatic regulation of Abeta production.",

Here we report an atomic structure of human gamma-secretase at 3.4 A resolution, determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Mutations derived from Alzheimer's disease affect residues at two hotspots in PS1, each located at the centre of a distinct four transmembrane segment (TM) bundle. TM2 and, to a lesser extent, TM6 exhibit considerable flexibility, yielding a plastic active site and adaptable surrounding elements. The active site of PS1 is accessible from the convex side of the TM horseshoe, suggesting considerable conformational changes in nicastrin extracellular domain after substrate recruitment. Component protein APH-1 serves as a scaffold, anchoring the lone transmembrane helix from nicastrin and supporting the flexible conformation of PS1. Ordered phospholipids stabilize the complex inside the membrane. Our structure serves as a molecular basis for mechanistic understanding of gamma-secretase function.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal tau lesions (non-argyrophilic pretangle material, argyrophilic neuropil threads, neurofibrillary tangles) in select types of neurons are crucial for the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Ongoing formation of these tau lesions persists into end-stage Alzheimer's disease and is not subject to remission. The early pretangle disease phase is a focus of increasing interest because only abnormal forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau are involved at that point and, in contrast to late-stage disease when amyloid-beta deposition is present, this phase is temporally closer to the prevailing conditions that induce the pathological process underlying Alzheimer's disease. Extracellular and aggregated amyloid-beta may only be produced under pathological conditions by nerve cells that contain abnormal tau. One potential trigger for tau protein hyperphosphorylation and conformational change in Alzheimer's disease may be the presence of a non-endogenous pathogen. Subsequently, a predictable regional distribution pattern of the tau lesions develops in phylogenetically late-appearing and ontogenetically late-maturing neurons that are connected via their axons. It is hoped that hypotheses drawn from these considerations, as well as from recent tau dissemination models, from studies of variant tau conformers, and from tau imaging will encourage the development of new preventative and disease-modifying strategies.",

    "abstract": "Magnesium lithospermate B (MLB) is one of the major bioactive components of Radix Salviae miltiorrhizae, a Chinese traditional herbal medicine colloquially known as Dan Shen. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of MLB against oligomeric amyloid beta (Abeta) (1-42)-induced neurotoxicity in cultured FVB mouse hippocampal neurons. We found that pretreatment with MLB not only prevents a loss in neuronal cell viability following exposure to Abeta (1-42), but also attenuates Abeta (1-42)-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neuronal apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies show that MLB counteracts Abeta (1-42)-induced activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway, evidenced by the suppression of NF-kappaB luciferase reporters, decreased expression of phosphorylated Inhibitor kappaB alpha and IkappaB kinase alpha, and reduced nuclear translocation of p65 in response to pre-treatment with 50 mug/ml MLB prior to Abeta (1-42) exposure. MLB was able to reverse the increase in phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) levels as well as the decrease in phosphorylated Akt levels that are induced by Abeta (1-42), although this finding did not extend to extracellular signal-regulated kinase or p38 kinases. Furthermore, combining MLB with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 synergistically counteracts the Abeta (1-42)-induced reduction in cell viability and neurite growth, and the neuroprotective effects of MLB could be attenuated by the Akt inhibitor triciribine. In conclusion, these results suggest that MLB can protect against Abeta (1-42)-induced neuronal damage, which is most likely to be mediated by the NK-kappaB pathway.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate utility of the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) in a mixed sample of adults with neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. METHOD: Cross-sectional, interview-based study. Participants were community-dwelling adults with disabilities resulting from neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders (N = 54), who participated in a pre-vocational readiness and social skills training program. Psychometric properties of the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) were assessed and validated against Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory (MPAI) and The Problem Checklist from the New York University Head Injury Family Interview (PCL). RESULTS: Based on the revised scoring procedures, psychometric properties of the CIQ Home Competency scale were excellent, followed by the Total score and Social Integration scale. Productive Activity scale had low content validity and a weak association with the total score. Convergent and discriminant validity of the CIQ were demonstrated by correlation patterns with MPAI scales in the expected direction. Significant relationship was found with PCL Physical/Dependency scale. Significant associations were found with sex, living status, and record of subsequent employment. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide support for the use of the CIQ as a measure of participation in individuals with neurological and neuropsychiatric diagnoses and resulting disabilities. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: An important goal of rehabilitation and training programs for individuals with dysfunction of the central nervous system is to promote their participation in social, vocational, and domestic activities. The Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) is a brief and efficient instrument for measuring these participation domains. This study demonstrated good psychometric properties and high utility of the CIQ in a sample of 54 individuals participating in a prevocational training program.",

    "abstract": "With an objective to develop beta-amyloid destabilizing agents, we have investigated the interactions of a few water-soluble near-infrared (NIR)-absorbing squaraine dyes 1-3 with lysozyme and its amyloid aggregates through photophysical and biophysical techniques. These dyes exhibited strong interactions with lysozyme and beta-amyloids in addition to serum albumins as evidenced by the absorption and emission changes. The interactions were found to be spontaneous with association constant values in the range of approximately 10(4)-10(5)  m(-1), as confirmed through half-reciprocal analysis and isothermal calorimetric measurements. Uniquely, such effective interactions of the dyes have led to the complete disassembly of the beta-amyloid fibrillar structures to form spherical particles approximately 350 nm in size, as confirmed through photophysical, thioflavin assay, circular dichroism (CD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), TEM, and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) techniques. These results demonstrate that the squaraine dyes 1-3 under investigation act as effective protein-labelling and destabilizing agents of the protein amyloidogenesis.",

    "title": "Systematic review of the quality of life issues associated with anal cancer and its treatment with radiochemotherapy.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Radiochemotherapy is the standard of care for the treatment of anal carcinoma achieving good loco-regional control and sphincter preservation. This approach is however associated with acute and late toxicities including haematological, skin, bowel function and genito-urinary complications. This paper systematically reviews studies addressing the quality of life (QoL) implications of anal cancer and radiochemotherapy. The paper also evaluates how QoL is assessed in anal cancer. METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library were searched for publications (1996-2014) reporting the effects on patients of anal cancer and radiochemotherapy. RESULTS: Of the 152 papers reporting treatment-related effects on patients, only 11 provided a formal assessment of QoL. In the absence of an anal cancer-specific measure, QoL was assessed using generic cancer instruments such as the core EORTC quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) or colorectal cancer tools such as the EORTC QLQ-CR29. Bowel function, particularly diarrhoea, and sexual problems were the most commonly reported QoL concerns. The review of QoL issues of anal cancer patients treated with radiochemotherapy is limited by the QoL assessment measures used. It is argued that certain treatment-related toxicities, for example skin-induced radiation problems, are overlooked or inadequately represented in existing measures. CONCLUSIONS: This review emphasises the need to develop an anal cancer-specific QoL measure and to incorporate QoL as an outcome of future trials in anal cancer. The results of this review are informative to clinicians and patients in terms of treatment decision-making.",

    "title": "Blocking IGF Signaling in Adult Neurons Alleviates Alzheimer's Disease Pathology through Amyloid-beta Clearance.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a frequent and irreversible age-related neurodegeneration without efficient treatment. Experimental AD in mice responds positively to decreased insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) signaling, a pathway also implicated in aging. Here we aimed to protect the aging brain from devastating amyloid pathology by making specifically adult neurons resistant to IGF signaling. To achieve that, we knocked out neuronal IGF-1R during adulthood in APP/PS1 mice. We found that mutants exhibited improved spatial memory and reduced anxiety. Mutant brains displayed fewer amyloid plaques, less amyloid-beta (Abeta), and diminished neuroinflammation. Surprisingly, adult neurons undergoing IGF-1R knock-out reduced their apical soma and developed leaner dendrites, indicative of remarkable structural plasticity entailing condensed forebrain neuroarchitecture. Neurons lacking IGF-1R in AD showed less accumulation of Abeta-containing autophagic vacuoles. At the same time, plasma Abeta levels were increased. Our data indicate that neuronal IGF-1R ablation, via preserved autophagic compartment and enhanced systemic elimination, offers lifelong protection from AD pathology by clearing toxic Abeta. Neuronal IGF-1R, and possibly other cell size-controlling pathways are promising targets for AD treatment. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We found compelling evidence in vivo that Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is significantly delayed when insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling is blocked in adult neurons. To show that, we built a novel mouse model, combining inducible neuron-specific IGF-1R knock-out with AD transgenics. Analysis of the experimental AD phenotype revealed less abundant amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, fewer plaques, and diminished neuroinflammation in mutants with inactivated IGF signaling, together with clearly preserved behavioral and memory performances. We present for the first time evidence that IGF signaling has profound effects on neuronal proteostasis and maintenance of cell morphology in vivo. Our results indicate in a model highly pertinent to translational research that neuronal IGF resistance may represent a pathophysiologically relevant mechanism of the brain for preventing Abeta accumulation.",

    "title": "ADAM10 and BACE1 are localized to synaptic vesicles.",
    "abstract": "Synaptic degeneration and accumulation of the neurotoxic amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in the brain are hallmarks of Alzheimer disease. Abeta is produced by sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), by the beta-secretase beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and gamma-secretase. However, Abeta generation is precluded if APP is cleaved by the alpha-secretase ADAM10 instead of BACE1. We have previously shown that Abeta can be produced locally at the synapse. To study the synaptic localization of the APP processing enzymes we used western blotting to demonstrate that, compared to total brain homogenate, ADAM10 and BACE1 were greatly enriched in synaptic vesicles isolated from rat brain using controlled-pore glass chromatography, whereas Presenilin1 was the only enriched component of the gamma-secretase complex. Moreover, we detected ADAM10 activity in synaptic vesicles and enrichment of the intermediate APP-C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs). We confirmed the western blotting findings using in situ proximity ligation assay to demonstrate close proximity of ADAM10 and BACE1 with the synaptic vesicle marker synaptophysin in intact mouse primary hippocampal neurons. In contrast, only sparse co-localization of active gamma-secretase and synaptophysin was detected. These results indicate that the first step of APP processing occurs in synaptic vesicles whereas the final step is more likely to take place elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is characterized by the presence of senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss in defined regions of the brain including the hippocampus and cortex. Transplantation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) offers a safe and potentially effective tool for treating neurodegenerative disorders. However, the therapeutic effects of BM-MSCs on AD pathology remain unclear and their mechanisms at cellular and molecular levels still need to be addressed. In this study, we developed a unique neuronal culture made from 5xFAD mouse, an APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model (FAD neurons) to investigate progressive neurodegeneration associated with AD pathology and efficacy of brain-derived neurotrophic factor expressing-MSCs (BDNF-MSCs). Analyses of the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synaptic markers and survival/apoptotic signals indicate that pathological features of cultured neurons made from these mice accurately mimic AD pathology, suggesting that our protocol provided a valid in vitro model of AD. We also demonstrated amelioration of AD pathology by MSCs in vitro when these FAD neurons were co-cultured with MSCs, a paradigm that mimics the in vivo environment of post-transplantation of MSCs into damaged regions of brains. To overcome failed delivery of BDNF to the brain and to enhance MSCs releasing BDNF effect, we created BDNF-MSCs and found that MSCs protection was enhanced by BDNF-MSCs. This protection was abolished by BDNF-blocking peptides, suggesting that BDNF supply from BDNF-MSCs was enough to prevent AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests an important role of cyclodextrins in providing protection in neurodegenerative disorders. Metal dyshomeostasis is reported to be a pathogenic factor in neurodegeneration because it could be responsible for damage involving oxidative stress and protein aggregation. As such, metal ions represent an effective target. To improve the metal-binding ability of cyclodextrin, we synthesized three new 8-hydroxyquinoline-cyclodextrin conjugates with difunctionalized cyclodextrins. In particular, the 3-difunctionalized regioisomer represents the first example of cyclodextrin with two pendants at the secondary rim, resulting in a promising compound. The derivatives have significant antioxidant capacity and the powerful activity in inhibiting self-induced amyloid-beta aggregation seems to be led by synergistic effects of both cyclodextrin and hydroxyquinoline. Moreover, the derivatives are also able to complex metal ions and to inhibit metal-induced protein aggregation. Therefore, these compounds could have potential as therapeutic agents in diseases related to protein aggregation and metal dyshomeostasis.",

    "abstract": "BetaACE1 is the major drug target for Alzheimer's disease, but we know surprisingly little about its normal function in the CNS. Here, we show that this protease is critically involved in semaphorin 3A (Sema3A)-mediated axonal guidance processes in thalamic and hippocampal neurons. An active membrane-bound proteolytic CHL1 fragment is generated by BACE1 upon Sema3A binding. This fragment relays the Sema3A signal via ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins to the neuronal cytoskeleton. APH1B-gamma-secretase-mediated degradation of this fragment stops the Sema3A-induced collapse and sensitizes the growth cone for the next axonal guidance cue. Thus, we reveal a cycle of proteolytic activity underlying growth cone collapse and restoration used by axons to find their correct trajectory in the brain. Our data also suggest that BACE1 and gamma-secretase inhibition have physiologically opposite effects in this process, supporting the idea that combination therapy might attenuate some of the side effects associated with these drugs.",

In the brain, 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) amplifies intracellular glucocorticoid levels. We show that short-term treatment of aged, cognitively impaired C57BL/6 mice with the potent and selective 11beta-HSD1 inhibitor UE2316 improves memory, including after intracerebroventricular drug administration to the central nervous system alone. In the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, UE2316 treatment of mice aged 14 months for 4 weeks also decreased the number of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in the cerebral cortex, associated with a selective increase in local insulin-degrading enzyme (involved in Abeta breakdown and known to be glucocorticoid regulated). Chronic treatment of young Tg2576 mice with UE2316 for up to 13 months prevented cognitive decline but did not prevent Abeta plaque formation. We conclude that reducing glucocorticoid regeneration in the brain improves cognition independently of reduced Abeta plaque pathology and that 11beta-HSD1 inhibitors have potential as cognitive enhancers in age-associated memory impairment and Alzheimer's dementia.",

Abeta(25-35), Abeta(1-40), and Abeta(12-28) were dried both on flat hydrophilic surfaces (contact angle (CA) = 37.3 ) and on nanostructured superhydrophobic ones (CA = 175.8 ). By embedding nanoroughened surfaces on top of highly X-ray transparent Si3N4 membranes, it was possible to probe the solid residues by raster-scan synchrotron radiation X-ray microdiffraction (muXRD). As compared to residues obtained on flat Si3N4 membranes, a general enhancement of fibrillar material was detected for all Abeta fragments dried on superhydrophobic surfaces, with a particular emphasis on the shorter ones. Indeed, both Abeta(25-35) and Abeta(12-28) showed a marked crystalline cross-beta phase with varying fiber textures. The homogeneous evaporation rate provided by these nanostructured supports, and the possibility to use transparent membranes, can open a wide range of in situ X-ray and spectroscopic characterizations of amyloidal peptides involved in neurodegenerative diseases and for the fabrication of amyloid-based nanodevices.",

Animals tested for place learning in the water-maze showed increased acquisition slopes and presence in the training quadrant during the probe test. An increased passive avoidance response was also observed for males. BChE KO mice therefore showed enhanced learning ability in spatial and non-spatial memory tests. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of increasing doses of amyloid-beta[25-35] (Abeta25-35) peptide oligomers resulted, in Wt mice, in learning and memory deficits, oxidative stress and decrease in ACh hippocampal content. In BChE KO mice, the Abeta25-35-induced deficit in place learning was attenuated in males and blocked in females. No change in lipid peroxidation or ACh levels was observed after Abeta25-35 treatment in male or female BChE KO mice.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Senile plaques consisting of amyloid-beta (Abeta) are the major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and have been the primary therapeutic target. Immunotherapies, which are designed to remove brain Abeta deposits, increased levels of soluble Abeta and accelerated brain atrophy in some clinical trials, suggesting that the solubilization of Abeta deposition might facilitate the formation of more toxic Abeta oligomers and enhance neurotoxicity. METHODS: The capacity of antibodies against different epitopes of Abeta to disaggregate preformed Abeta fibrils was investigated. The co-incubation of antibodies and Abeta fibrils was then tested for neurotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: After the incubation of preformed Abeta fibrils with the N-terminal antibody 6E10, the fibrils were decreased, while the oligomers, mostly dimers and trimers, were significantly increased. However, no such effects were observed for antibodies targeting the middle domain (4G8) and C-terminus of Abeta (8G7). The co-incubates of preformed Abeta fibrils with 6E10 were more neurotoxic, both in vitro and in vivo, than the co-incubates with 4G8 and 8G7. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the antibody targeting the N-terminus of Abeta promoted the transformation of Abeta from fibrils into oligomers and increased neurotoxicity. Immunotherapies should take into consideration the enhanced neurotoxicity associated with the solubilization of Abeta deposits by antibodies against the Nterminus of Abeta.",

At death, there was a uniform neuropathologic examination to quantify 7 dementia-related pathologies. RESULTS: In the full group, memory ratings were modestly correlated with memory performance (intercepts r = 0.26, p < 0.001; slopes r = 0.23, p < 001) and so we regressed each person's memory performance on their memory ratings, and the residuals provided longitudinal indicators of memory awareness. In a subset of 239 persons who developed dementia, episodic memory awareness was stable until a mean of 2.6 years before dementia onset (95% credible interval -2.7, -1.6); thereafter, memory awareness declined rapidly (mean annual change -0.32, 95% credible interval -0.37, -0.28). Older age at baseline was associated with later onset of memory unawareness. In a subset of 385 persons who died and underwent neuropathologic examination, transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, tau tangles, and gross cerebral infarcts were related to decline in memory awareness. In the absence of these pathologies, no decline in memory awareness was evident. Results were similar in subgroups with and without dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of memory impairment typically begins to decline about 2-3 years before dementia onset and is associated with postmortem evidence of TDP-43 pathology, tangles, and gross cerebral infarcts.",

    "title": "The keystone of Alzheimer pathogenesis might be sought in Abeta physiology.",
    "abstract": "For several years Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has been considered the main pathogenetic factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). According to the so called Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis the increase of Abeta triggers a series of events leading to synaptic dysfunction and memory loss as well as to the structural brain damage in the later stage of the disease. However, several evidences suggest that this hypothesis is not sufficient to explain AD pathogenesis, especially considering that most of the clinical trials aimed to decrease Abeta levels have been unsuccessful. Moreover, Abeta is physiologically produced in the healthy brain during neuronal activity and it is needed for synaptic plasticity and memory. Here we propose a model interpreting AD pathogenesis as an alteration of the negative feedback loop between Abeta and its physiological receptors, focusing on alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7-nAchRs). According to this vision, when Abeta cannot exert its physiological function a negative feedback mechanism would induce a compensatory increase of its production leading to an abnormal accumulation that reduces alpha7-nAchR function, leading to synaptic dysfunction and memory loss. In this perspective, the indiscriminate Abeta removal might worsen neuronal homeostasis, causing a further impoverishment of learning and memory. Even if further studies are needed to better understand and validate these mechanisms, we believe that to deepen the role of Abeta in physiological conditions might represent the keystone to elucidate important aspects of AD pathogenesis.",

    "title": "Effects of BACE1 haploinsufficiency on APP processing and Abeta concentrations in male and female 5XFAD Alzheimer mice at different disease stages.",
    "abstract": "beta-Site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) initiates the generation of amyloid-beta (Abeta), thus representing a prime therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous work including ours has used BACE1 haploinsufficiency (BACE1(+/-); i.e., 50% reduction) as a therapeutic relevant model to evaluate the efficacy of partial beta-secretase inhibition. However, it is unclear whether the extent of Abeta reductions in amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice with BACE1(+/-) gene ablation may vary with sex or disease progression. Here, we compared the impacts of BACE1 haploinsufficiency on Abeta concentrations and APP processing in 5XFAD Alzheimer mice (1) between males and females and (2) between different stages with moderate and robust Abeta accumulation. First, male and female 5XFAD mice at 6-7 months of age showed equivalent levels of Abeta, BACE1, full-length APP and its metabolites. BACE1 haploinsufficiency significantly lowered soluble Abeta oligomers, total Abeta42 levels and plaque burden in 5XFAD mouse brains irrespective of sex. Furthermore, there was no sex difference in reductions of beta-cleavage products of APP (C99 and sAPPbeta) found in BACE1(+/-) 5XFAD mice relative to BACE1(+/+) 5XFAD controls. Meanwhile, APP and sAPPalpha levels in BACE1(+/-) 5XFAD mice were higher than those of 5XFAD controls regardless of sex. Based on these observations, we next combined male and female data to examine the effects of BACE1 haploinsufficiency in 5XFAD mice at 12-14 months of age, as compared with those in 6-7-month-old 5XFAD mice. Oligomeric Abeta and C99 levels were dramatically elevated in older 5XFAD mice. Although the beta-metabolites of APP were significantly reduced by BACE1 haploinsufficiency in both age groups, high levels of these toxic amyloidogenic fragments remained in 12-14-month-old BACE1(+/-) 5XFAD mice. The present findings are consistent with our previous behavioral data showing that BACE1 haploinsufficiency rescues memory deficits in 5XFAD mice irrespective of sex but only in the younger age group.",

It is the goal of this research to determine the toxic effects of nano-alumina on human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and mouse hippocampal HT22 cells in vitro and on ICR female mice in vivo. Nano-alumina displayed toxic effects on SH-SY5Y cell lines in three different concentrations also increased aluminium abundance and induced oxidative stress in HT22 cells. Nano-alumina peripherally administered to ICR female mice for three weeks increased brain aluminium and ROS production, disturbing brain energy homeostasis, and led to the impairment of hippocampus-dependent memory. Most importantly, these nano-particles induced Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology by enhancing the amyloidogenic pathway of Amyloid Beta (Abeta) production, aggregation and implied the progression of neurodegeneration in the cortex and hippocampus of these mice. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that nano-alumina is toxic to both cells and female mice and that prolonged exposure may heighten the chances of developing a neurodegenerative disease, such as AD.",

To further evaluate the role of autophagy in Alzheimer's disease, the present study was implemented to investigate the effects of autophagy on alpha-secretase, beta-secretase, or gamma-secretase, and observe the effects of autophagy on autophagic clearance markers. These results showed that both autophagy inhibitor and inducer enhanced the activity of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretases, and Abeta production. Autophagy inhibitor may more activate gamma-secretase and promote Abeta production and accumulation than its inducer. Both autophagy inhibitor and inducer had no influence on Abeta clearance.

    "abstract": "Heparan sulfate (HS)-containing, S-nitrosylated (SNO) glypican-1 (Gpc-1) releases anhydromannose-containing HS (anMan-HS) by SNO-catalyzed autodegradation in endosomes. Transport of anMan-HS to the nucleus requires processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to amyloid beta peptides (Abeta). To further examine the relationship between APP and Gpc-1 processing in normal fibroblasts we have suppressed Gpc-1 autodegradation by aminoguanidine inhibition of NO synthesis and prevented lysosomal degradation of anMan-HS by using chloroquine. Deconvolution immunofluorescence microscopy and SDS-PAGE using anMan- and APP/Abeta-specific antibodies and markers for nuclei and autophagosomes were used to identify subcellular localization of Abeta and its oligomeric state. Wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (WT MEF) grown during NO-deprivation accumulated 95-98% of Abeta as oligomers in the nucleus. WT MEF treated with chloroquine accumulated both anMan-HS and Abeta, first in the nucleus then in autophagosomes. Maximal nuclear anMan-HS and Abeta accumulation was obtained after 4 and 7 h of growth, respectively. Both yielded similar banding patterns on SDS-PAGE which were also similar to the Abeta oligomers obtained after NO-deprivation. Nuclear Abeta accumulation was marginally increased (from 54 to 58%) by suppression of both release and degradation of anMan-HS. Nuclear exit of Abeta, accumulated during growth in aminoguanidine, was enhanced by ascorbate-induced reactivation of anMan-HS production. Transgenic Alzheimer disease mouse (Tg2576) MEF, which produces excess amount of Abeta was used for comparison. Overall, nuclear Abeta exit and lysosomal degradation was compromised by inhibition of the autophagosome-lysosome pathway in both WT and Tg2576 MEF, while only WT MEF was sensitive to suppression of Gpc-1 autodegradation.",

The contribution of VBI to cognitive impairment and dementia, particularly in the context of AD pathology, has been examined extensively yet remains difficult to characterize due to conflicting results. Describing the relative contribution and mechanisms of VBI in dementia is important because of the profound impact of dementia on individuals, caregivers, families, and society, particularly the stability of health care systems with the rapidly increasing age of our population.

    "title": "Global, regional, and national disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for 306 diseases and injuries and healthy life expectancy (HALE) for 188 countries, 1990-2013: quantifying the epidemiological transition.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) aims to bring together all available epidemiological data using a coherent measurement framework, standardised estimation methods, and transparent data sources to enable comparisons of health loss over time and across causes, age-sex groups, and countries. The GBD can be used to generate summary measures such as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE) that make possible comparative assessments of broad epidemiological patterns across countries and time. These summary measures can also be used to quantify the component of variation in epidemiology that is related to sociodemographic development. METHODS: We used the published GBD 2013 data for age-specific mortality, years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) to calculate DALYs and HALE for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2013 for 188 countries. We calculated HALE using the Sullivan method; 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) represent uncertainty in age-specific death rates and YLDs per person for each country, age, sex, and year. We estimated DALYs for 306 causes for each country as the sum of YLLs and YLDs; 95% UIs represent uncertainty in YLL and YLD rates. We quantified patterns of the epidemiological transition with a composite indicator of sociodemographic status, which we constructed from income per person, average years of schooling after age 15 years, and the total fertility rate and mean age of the population. We applied hierarchical regression to DALY rates by cause across countries to decompose variance related to the sociodemographic status variable, country, and time. FINDINGS: Worldwide, from 1990 to 2013, life expectancy at birth rose by 6 2 years (95% UI 5 6-6 6), from 65 3 years (65 0-65 6) in 1990 to 71 5 years (71 0-71 9) in 2013, HALE at birth rose by 5 4 years (4 9-5 8), from 56 9 years (54 5-59 1) to 62 3 years (59 7-64 8), total DALYs fell by 3 6% (0 3-7 4), and age-standardised DALY rates per 100 000 people fell by 26 7% (24 6-29 1). For communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, global DALY numbers, crude rates, and age-standardised rates have all declined between 1990 and 2013, whereas for non-communicable diseases, global DALYs have been increasing, DALY rates have remained nearly constant, and age-standardised DALY rates declined during the same period. From 2005 to 2013, the number of DALYs increased for most specific non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, in addition to dengue, food-borne trematodes, and leishmaniasis; DALYs decreased for nearly all other causes. By 2013, the five leading causes of DALYs were ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, cerebrovascular disease, low back and neck pain, and road injuries. Sociodemographic status explained more than 50% of the variance between countries and over time for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; maternal disorders; neonatal disorders; nutritional deficiencies; other communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases; musculoskeletal disorders; and other non-communicable diseases. However, sociodemographic status explained less than 10% of the variance in DALY rates for cardiovascular diseases; chronic respiratory diseases; cirrhosis; diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases; unintentional injuries; and self-harm and interpersonal violence. Predictably, increased sociodemographic status was associated with a shift in burden from YLLs to YLDs, driven by declines in YLLs and increases in YLDs from musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, and mental and substance use disorders. In most country-specific estimates, the increase in life expectancy was greater than that in HALE. Leading causes of DALYs are highly variable across countries. INTERPRETATION: Global health is improving. Population growth and ageing have driven up numbers of DALYs, but crude rates have remained relatively constant, showing that progress in health does not mean fewer demands on health systems. The notion of an epidemiological transition--in which increasing sociodemographic status brings structured change in disease burden--is useful, but there is tremendous variation in burden of disease that is not associated with sociodemographic status. This further underscores the need for country-specific assessments of DALYs and HALE to appropriately inform health policy decisions and attendant actions. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of alpha-synuclein (asyn), an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), is a hallmark in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the conformational changes that asyn undergoes in the presence of membrane and membrane mimetics using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). In solution, asyn is monomeric and unfolded assuming an ensemble of conformers spanning extended and compact conformations. Using the contrast variation technique and SANS, the protein scattering signal in the membrane-protein complexes is selectively highlighted in order to monitor its conformational changes in this environment. We showed that in the presence of phospholipid membranes asyn transitions from a monodisperse state to aggregated structures with sizes ranging from 200 to 900A coexisting with the monomeric species. Detailed SANS data analysis revealed that asyn aggregates have a hierarchical organization in which clusters of smaller asyn aggregates assemble to form the larger structures. This study provides new insight into the mechanism of asyn aggregation. We propose an aggregation mechanism in which stable asyn aggregates seed the aggregation process and hence the hierarchical assembly of structures. Our findings demonstrate that membrane-induced conformational changes in asyn lead to its heterogeneous aggregation which could be physiologically relevant in its function or in the diseased state.",

    "title": "eta-Secretase processing of APP inhibits neuronal activity in the hippocampus.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques, which are predominantly composed of amyloid-beta peptide. Two principal physiological pathways either prevent or promote amyloid-beta generation from its precursor, beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), in a competitive manner. Although APP processing has been studied in great detail, unknown proteolytic events seem to hinder stoichiometric analyses of APP metabolism in vivo. Here we describe a new physiological APP processing pathway, which generates proteolytic fragments capable of inhibiting neuronal activity within the hippocampus. We identify higher molecular mass carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, termed CTF-eta, in addition to the long-known CTF-alpha and CTF-beta fragments generated by the alpha- and beta-secretases ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) and BACE1 (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1), respectively. CTF-eta generation is mediated in part by membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinases such as MT5-MMP, referred to as eta-secretase activity. eta-Secretase cleavage occurs primarily at amino acids 504-505 of APP695, releasing a truncated ectodomain. After shedding of this ectodomain, CTF-eta is further processed by ADAM10 and BACE1 to release long and short Aeta peptides (termed Aeta-alpha and Aeta-beta). CTFs produced by eta-secretase are enriched in dystrophic neurites in an AD mouse model and in human AD brains. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 activity results in robust accumulation of CTF-eta and Aeta-alpha. In mice treated with a potent BACE1 inhibitor, hippocampal long-term potentiation was reduced. Notably, when recombinant or synthetic Aeta-alpha was applied on hippocampal slices ex vivo, long-term potentiation was lowered. Furthermore, in vivo single-cell two-photon calcium imaging showed that hippocampal neuronal activity was attenuated by Aeta-alpha. These findings not only demonstrate a major functionally relevant APP processing pathway, but may also indicate potential translational relevance for therapeutic strategies targeting APP processing.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNA-181a binds to the 3' untranslated region of messenger RNA (mRNA) for renin, a rate-limiting enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system. Our objective was to determine whether this molecular interaction translates into a clinically meaningful effect on blood pressure and whether circulating miR-181a is a measurable proxy of blood pressure. In 200 human kidneys from the TRANScriptome of renaL humAn TissuE (TRANSLATE) study, renal miR-181a was the sole negative predictor of renin mRNA and a strong correlate of circulating miR-181a. Elevated miR-181a levels correlated positively with systolic and diastolic blood pressure in TRANSLATE, and this association was independent of circulating renin. The association between serum miR-181a and systolic blood pressure was replicated in 199 subjects from the Genetic Regulation of Arterial Pressure of Humans In the Community (GRAPHIC) study. Renal immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization showed that colocalization of miR-181a and renin was most prominent in collecting ducts where renin is not released into the systemic circulation. Analysis of 69 human kidneys characterized by RNA sequencing revealed that miR-181a was associated with downregulation of four mitochondrial pathways and upregulation of 41 signaling cascades of adaptive immunity and inflammation. We conclude that renal miR-181a has pleiotropic effects on pathways relevant to blood pressure regulation and that circulating levels of miR-181a are both a measurable proxy of renal miR-181a expression and a novel biochemical correlate of blood pressure.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how midlife risk factors influence age at onset (AAO) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) may provide clues to delay disease expression. Although midlife adiposity predicts increased incidence of AD, it is unclear whether it affects AAO and severity of Alzheimer's neuropathology. Using a prospective population-based cohort, Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), this study aims to examine the relationships between midlife body mass index (BMI) and (1) AAO of AD (2) severity of Alzheimer's neuropathology and (3) fibrillar brain amyloid deposition during aging. We analyzed data on 1394 cognitively normal individuals at baseline (8643 visits; average follow-up interval 13.9 years), among whom 142 participants developed incident AD. In two subsamples of BLSA, 191 participants underwent autopsy and neuropathological assessment, and 75 non-demented individuals underwent brain amyloid imaging. Midlife adiposity was derived from BMI data at 50 years of age. We find that each unit increase in midlife BMI predicts earlier onset of AD by 6.7 months (P=0.013). Higher midlife BMI was associated with greater Braak neurofibrillary but not CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease) neuritic plaque scores at autopsy overall. Associations between midlife BMI and brain amyloid burden approached statistical significance. Thus, higher midlife BMI was also associated with greater fibrillar amyloid measured by global mean cortical distribution volume ratio (P=0.075) and within the precuneus (left, P=0.061; right, P=0.079). In conclusion, midlife overweight predicts earlier onset of AD and greater burden of Alzheimer's neuropathology. A healthy BMI at midlife may delay the onset of AD.",

    "abstract": "We have sequenced the complete genomes of 72 individuals affected with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease caused by an autosomal dominant, highly penetrant mutation in the presenilin-1 (PSEN1) gene, and performed genome-wide association testing to identify variants that modify age at onset (AAO) of Alzheimer's disease. Our analysis identified a haplotype of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 17 within a chemokine gene cluster associated with delayed onset of mild-cognitive impairment and dementia. Individuals carrying this haplotype had a mean AAO of mild-cognitive impairment at 51.0 +- 5.2 years compared with 41.1 +- 7.4 years for those without these SNPs. This haplotype thus appears to modify Alzheimer's AAO, conferring a large (~10 years) protective effect. The associated locus harbors several chemokines including eotaxin-1 encoded by CCL11, and the haplotype includes a missense polymorphism in this gene. Validating this association, we found plasma eotaxin-1 levels were correlated with disease AAO in an independent cohort from the University of California San Francisco Memory and Aging Center. In this second cohort, the associated haplotype disrupted the typical age-associated increase of eotaxin-1 levels, suggesting a complex regulatory role for this haplotype in the general population. Altogether, these results suggest eotaxin-1 as a novel modifier of Alzheimer's disease AAO and open potential avenues for therapy.",

    "abstract": "The growing interest for peptide therapeutics calls for new strategies to determine the physico-chemical properties responsible for the interactions of peptides with the environment. This study reports about the lipophilicity of two fragments of the amyloid beta-peptide, Abeta 25-35 and Abeta 12-28. Firstly, computational studies showed the limits of log D(7.4)oct in describing the lipophilicity of medium-sized peptides. Chromatographic lipophilicity indexes (expressed as log k', the logarithm of the retention factor) were then measured in three different systems to highlight the different skills of Abeta 25-35 and Abeta 12-28 in giving interactions with polar and apolar environments. CD studies were also performed to validate chromatographic experimental conditions. Results show that Abeta 12-28 has a larger skill in promoting hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions than Abeta 25-35. This finding proposes a strategy to determine the lipophilicity of peptides for drug discovery purposes but also gives insights in unraveling the debate about the aminoacidic region of Abeta responsible for its neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Low CSF beta-amyloid 1-42 has been associated with cognitive decline in advanced Parkinson's disease; data from a single cohort suggest beta-amyloid 1-42 may be an early marker of cognitive impairment. Newly diagnosed Parkinson's participants (mean duration, 6.9 months) in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (n = 341) were assessed at baseline (untreated state) and followed for 2 years. CSF beta-amyloid 1-42, alpha-synuclein, total tau, and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 were collected at baseline. Participants were classified as having cognitive impairment (CI) if scores on two of six cognitive tests were 1.5 standard deviations below the standardized mean based on published norms in healthy controls. Multivariable regression analyses were used to determine the association between baseline CSF markers with cognitive impairment, defined by neuropsychological testing performance at 2-year follow-up. Fifty-five participants (16.1 %) had CI at baseline and were not included in further analyses. Thirty-seven of the 286 participants without CI at baseline (12.9 %) developed CI at 2 years. Participants with CI at 2 years had significantly lower mean baseline CSF beta-amyloid 1-42 levels than non-CI participants (343.8 vs. 380.4 pg/mL, p < 0.01); no significant difference was seen for alpha-synuclein, T-tau, or P-tau 181. In a regression model of 286 participants without baseline CI adjusted for age, gender, disease duration, education, motor severity, and depression status, lower baseline beta-amyloid 1-42 levels were associated with higher odds of CI at 2 years. (OR(10pg/mL) = 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.08, p < 0.05). CSF beta-amyloid 1-42 level at disease onset is an independent predictor of cognitive impairment in early Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The hallmarks of Alzheimer disease are amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles accompanied by signs of neuroinflammation. Lysozyme is a major player in the innate immune system and has recently been shown to prevent the aggregation of amyloid-beta1-40 in vitro. In this study we found that patients with Alzheimer disease have increased lysozyme levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and lysozyme co-localized with amyloid-beta in plaques. In Drosophila neuronal co-expression of lysozyme and amyloid-beta1-42 reduced the formation of soluble and insoluble amyloid-beta species, prolonged survival and improved the activity of amyloid-beta1-42 transgenic flies. This suggests that lysozyme levels rise in Alzheimer disease as a compensatory response to amyloid-beta increases and aggregation. In support of this, in vitro aggregation assays revealed that lysozyme associates with amyloid-beta1-42 and alters its aggregation pathway to counteract the formation of toxic amyloid-beta species. Overall, these studies establish a protective role for lysozyme against amyloid-beta associated toxicities and identify increased lysozyme in patients with Alzheimer disease. Therefore, lysozyme has potential as a new biomarker as well as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer disease.",

    "abstract": "The design of inhibitors of protein-protein interactions mediating amyloid self-assembly is a major challenge mainly due to the dynamic nature of the involved structures and interfaces. Interactions of amyloidogenic polypeptides with other proteins are important modulators of self-assembly. Here we present a hot-segment-linking approach to design a series of mimics of the IAPP cross-amyloid interaction surface with Abeta (ISMs) as nanomolar inhibitors of amyloidogenesis and cytotoxicity of Abeta, IAPP, or both polypeptides. The nature of the linker determines ISM structure and inhibitory function including both potency and target selectivity. Importantly, ISMs effectively suppress both self- and cross-seeded IAPP self-assembly. Our results provide a novel class of highly potent peptide leads for targeting protein aggregation in Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, or both diseases and a chemical approach to inhibit amyloid self-assembly and pathogenic interactions of other proteins as well.",

    "title": "Neuronal-Targeted TFEB Accelerates Lysosomal Degradation of APP, Reducing Abeta Generation and Amyloid Plaque Pathogenesis.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: In AD, an imbalance between Abeta production and removal drives elevated brain Abeta levels and eventual amyloid plaque deposition. APP undergoes nonamyloidogenic processing via alpha-cleavage at the plasma membrane, amyloidogenic beta- and gamma-cleavage within endosomes to generate Abeta, or lysosomal degradation in neurons. Considering multiple reports implicating impaired lysosome function as a driver of increased amyloidogenic processing of APP, we explored the efficacy of targeting transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal pathways, to reduce Abeta levels. CMV promoter-driven TFEB, transduced via stereotactic hippocampal injections of adeno-associated virus particles in APP/PS1 mice, localized primarily to neuronal nuclei and upregulated lysosome biogenesis. This resulted in reduction of APP protein, the alpha and beta C-terminal APP fragments (CTFs), and in the steady-state Abeta levels in the brain interstitial fluid. In aged mice, total Abeta levels and amyloid plaque load were selectively reduced in the TFEB-transduced hippocampi. TFEB transfection in N2a cells stably expressing APP695, stimulated lysosome biogenesis, reduced steady-state levels of APP and alpha- and beta-CTFs, and attenuated Abeta generation by accelerating flux through the endosome-lysosome pathway. Cycloheximide chase assays revealed a shortening of APP half-life with exogenous TFEB expression, which was prevented by concomitant inhibition of lysosomal acidification. These data indicate that TFEB enhances flux through lysosomal degradative pathways to induce APP degradation and reduce Abeta generation. Activation of TFEB in neurons is an effective strategy to attenuate Abeta generation and attenuate amyloid plaque deposition in AD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: A key driver for AD pathogenesis is the net balance between production and clearance of Abeta, the major component of amyloid plaques. Here we demonstrate that lysosomal degradation of holo-APP influences Abeta production by limiting the availability of APP for amyloidogenic processing. Using viral gene transfer of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis in neurons of APP/PS1 mice, steady-state levels of APP were reduced, resulting in decreased interstitial fluid Abeta levels and attenuated amyloid deposits. These effects were caused by accelerated lysosomal degradation of endocytosed APP, reflected by reduced APP half-life and steady-state levels in TFEB-expressing cells, with resultant decrease in Abeta production and release. Additional studies are needed to explore the therapeutic potential of this approach.",

    "abstract": "The primary nucleation step in amyloid fibril formation can, depending on the nature of peptide sequence, occur in one step, straight from a dilute solution, or in multiple steps, via oligomers or disordered aggregates. The precise kinetic pathways of these processes are poorly understood. Employing forward flux sampling and a midresolution coarse-grained force field, we analyzed the reactive pathways from the solvated state to the fibril nucleus for a system of 12 amyloidogenic peptides. In line with previous work, increasing the overall side-chain hydrophobicity switches the fibrillization mechanism from one- to two-step nucleation. Overall, in this mechanism, peptides first form dimers and trimers, which then grow into a beta-sheet. This sheet serves as a template for nucleation of additional beta sheets until the fibril nucleus is fully formed. Our simulations indicate that the presence of the recently predicted polymerized phase in the nucleation pathway of intermediately hydrophobic peptides slows down the dynamics of fibril formation considerably, which may influence the time scale on which toxic early oligomers exist. The structure of the amyloid fibrils was found to be strongly dependent on the relative hydrophobic strength of side chains along the sequence: beta sheets in the fibril are oriented such that a core of the relative strongest hydrophobic residues is formed along the fibril axis.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to develop a hybrid three-dimensional-tissue engineering construct for chondrogenesis. The hypothesis was that they support chondrogenesis. A biodegradable, highly porous polycaprolactone-grate was produced by solid freeform fabrication. The polycaprolactone support was coated with a chitosan/polyethylene oxide nanofibre sheet produced by electrospinning. Transforming growth factor-beta3-induced chondrogenesis was followed using the following markers: sex determining region Y/-box 9, runt-related transcription factor 2 and collagen II and X in quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, histology and immunostaining. A polycaprolactone-grate and an optimized chitosan/polyethylene oxide nanofibre sheet supported cellular aggregation, chondrogenesis and matrix formation. In tissue engineering constructs, the sheets were seeded first with mesenchymal stem cells and then piled up according to the lasagne principle. The advantages of such a construct are (1) the cells do not need to migrate to the tissue engineering construct and therefore pore size and interconnectivity problems are omitted and (2) the cell-tight nanofibre sheet and collagen-fibre network mimic a cell culture platform for mesenchymal stem cells/chondrocytes (preventing escape) and hinders in-growth of fibroblasts and fibrous scarring (preventing capture). This allows time for the slowly progressing, multiphase true cartilage regeneration.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The sural nerve (SN) is a sensory nerve in the lower extremity which branches to supply the skin on the distal posterolateral third of the lower limb. Typically, the medial sural cutaneous nerve (MSCN) and the peroneal communicating nerve (PCN) unite to form the SN. Other variations in the formation, course, and morphometry of the SN have also been described in the literature. OBJECTIVE: To study anatomical variations in the formation and course of the SN and establish a new classification system for formation patterns of the SN. METHODS: A systematic search of all major databases identified articles that studied the prevalence of variations in the formation of the SN. No date or language restrictions were set. Anatomical data was extracted according to our new classification system where the SN is formed by: union of the MSCN and the PCN (Type 1); union of the MSCN and the Lateral Sural Cutaneous Nerve (LSCN) (Type 2); continuation of the MSCN with absent PCN (Type 3); the PCN alone (Type 4); the LSCN (Type 5); or the Sciatic Nerve (SCN) directly (Type 6). Pooled prevalence rates were calculated using MetaXL 2.0. RESULTS: A total of 39 studies (n=3974 limbs) were included in the meta-analysis. The most common patterns were Type 1, Type 3, and Type 2 with a pooled prevalence of 51.5% (95% CI: 0.293-0.591), 31.2% (95% CI: 0.143-0.410), and 13.8% (95% CI: 0.035-0.234), respectively. The rest of the patterns were rare, with pooled prevalence of Types 4, 5, and 6 calculated to be 1.8% (95% CI: 0-0.063), 1.1% (95% CI: 0-0.050), and 0.7% (95% CI: 0-0.041), respectively. In 83.7% (95% CI: 0.765-0.899) of limbs, the site of union was in the lower half of the lower extremity. The pooled mean length of the SN from the formation to the lateral malleolus was 14.78 (+-5.76) cm, while the mean diameter of the SN was 0.28 (+-0.03) cm. CONCLUSIONS: Anatomical variations in the formation and course of the SN are common in the population. Clinicians, especially surgeons, should be aware of these variations to avoid iatrogenic injury to the nerve during operative procedures.",

    "abstract": "We recently found that sAPPalpha decreases amyloid-beta generation by directly associating with beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-converting enzyme 1 (BACE1), thereby modulating APP processing. Because inhibition of BACE1 decreases glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta)-mediated Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like tau phosphorylation in AD patient-derived neurons, we determined whether sAPPalpha also reduces GSK3beta-mediated tau phosphorylation. We initially found increased levels of inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3beta (Ser9) in primary neurons from sAPPalpha over-expressing mice. Further, recombinant human sAPPalpha evoked the same phenomenon in SH-SY5Y cells. Further, in SH-SY5Y cells over-expressing BACE1, and HeLa cells over-expressing human tau, sAPPalpha reduced GSK3beta activity and tau phosphorylation. Importantly, the reductions in GSK3beta activity and tau phosphorylation elicited by sAPPalpha were prevented by BACE1 but not gamma-secretase inhibition. In accord, AD mice over-expressing human sAPPalpha had less GSK3beta activity and tau phosphorylation compared with controls. These results implicate a direct relationship between APP beta-processing and GSK3beta-mediated tau phosphorylation and further define the central role of sAPPalpha in APP autoregulation and AD pathogenesis.",

In this study, we investigated the effect of consumption of EVOO-enriched diet on amyloid- and tau-related pathological alterations that are associated with the progression of AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in TgSwDI mice. Feeding mice with EVOO-enriched diet for 6months, beginning at an age before amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation starts, has significantly reduced total Abeta and tau brain levels with a significant improvement in mouse cognitive behavior. This reduction in brain Abeta was explained by the enhanced Abeta clearance pathways and reduced brain production of Abeta via modulation of amyloid-beta precursor protein processing. On the other hand, although feeding mice with EVOO-enriched diet for 3months, beginning at an age after Abeta accumulation starts, showed improved clearance across the blood-brain barrier and significant reduction in Abeta levels, it did not affect tau levels or improve cognitive functions of TgSwDI mouse.

    "abstract": "Recent efforts have revealed the microRNA (miRNA) pathways in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epidemiological studies have revealed an association between folic acid deficiency and AD risk. However, the effects of folic acid deficiency on miRNA expression in AD animals have not been observed. We aimed to find if folic acid deficiency may enhance amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide deposition and regulate amyloid-associated miRNAs and their target genes expression in APP/PS1 mice. APP/PS1 mice and N2a cells were treated with folic acid-deficient diet or medium. Cognitive function of mice was assessed using the Morris water maze. miRNA profile was tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array. Different expressional miRNAs were validated by real-time PCR. The deposition of Abeta plaques was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. APP and BACE1 proteins in mice brain and N2a cells were determined by Western blot. Folic acid deficiency aggravated amyloid pathology in AD mice. The AD+FD group showed shorter time spent in the target zone during the probe test. Analysis of miRNAs predicted to target these genes revealed several miRNA candidates that were differentially modulated by folic acid deficiency. In APP/PS1 mice brains and N2a cells with folic acid-deficient treatment, miR-106a-5p, miR-200b-3p and miR-339-5p were down-regulated, and their target genes APP and BACE1 were up-regulated. In conclusion, folic acid deficiency can enhance Abeta accumulation in APP/PS1 mice brain and decrease amyloid-associated miRNAs expression.",

    "abstract": "Excessive accumulation and deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) has been considered as a pivotal event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuronal apoptosis is one of the characteristics of AD, which is a possible mechanism underlying Abeta-induced neuronal neurotoxicity. Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a newly discovered vertebrate heme protein that exhibits neuroprotective functions against cell death associated with hypoxic and amyloid insult. However, until now, the exact mechanism of neuroglobin's protective action has not been determined. To investigate the potential neuroprotective roles and mechanisms of Ngb, transgenic AD mice (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) and SH-SY5Y cells transfected with pAPPswe were enrolled into the study. In vivo, overexpression of Ngb via intracerebroventricular injection with pNgb attenuated memory, cognitive impairment, and plaque generations. In pAPPswe transfected SH-SY5Y cells, Ngb not only decreased the generation of Abeta42, but also attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis through suppressing the activation of caspase-3, caspase-9 by Akt activating phosphorylation, which were restrained by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002). Our data indicate the anti-apoptotic property of Ngb may play a neuroprotective role against AD.",

    "abstract": "It is unclear how human apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) increases the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although Abeta levels can lead to insulin signaling impairment, these experiments were done in the absence of human ApoE. To examine ApoE role, we crossed the human ApoE-targeted replacement mice with mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP) mice. In 26 week old mice with lower Abeta levels, the expression and phosphorylation of insulin signaling proteins remained comparable among APP, ApoE3xAPP and ApoE4xAPP mouse brains. When the mice aged to 78 weeks, these proteins were markedly reduced in APP and ApoE4xAPP mouse brains. While Abeta can bind to insulin receptor, how ApoE isoforms modulate this interaction remains unknown. Here, we showed that ApoE3 had greater association with insulin receptor as compared to ApoE4, regardless of Abeta42 concentration. In contrast, ApoE4 bound more Abeta42 with increasing peptide levels. Using primary hippocampal neurons, we showed that ApoE3 and ApoE4 neurons are equally sensitive to physiological levels of insulin. However, in the presence of Abeta42, insulin failed to elicit a downstream response only in ApoE4 hippocampal neurons. Taken together, our data show that ApoE genotypes can modulate this Abeta-mediated insulin signaling impairment.",

    "abstract": "The Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase interacts with the non-selective cation channels TRPC6 but the functional consequences of this association are unknown. Experiments performed with HEK cells over-expressing TRPC6 channels showed that inhibiting the activity of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase with ouabain reduced the amount of TRPC6 proteins and depressed Ca(2+) entry through TRPC6. This effect, not mimicked by membrane depolarization with KCl, was abolished by sucrose and bafilomycin-A, and was partially sensitive to the intracellular Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA/AM. Biotinylation and subcellular fractionation experiments showed that ouabain caused a multifaceted redistribution of TRPC6 to the plasma membrane and to an endo/lysosomal compartment where they were degraded. The amyloid beta peptide Abeta(1-40), another inhibitor of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, but not the shorter peptide Abeta1-16, reduced TRPC6 protein levels and depressed TRPC6-mediated responses. In cortical neurons from embryonic mice, ouabain, veratridine (an opener of voltage-gated Na(+) channel), and Abeta(1-40) reduced TRPC6-mediated Ca(2+) responses whereas Abeta(1-16) was ineffective. Furthermore, when Abeta(1-40) was co-added together with zinc acetate it could no longer control TRPC6 activity. Altogether, this work shows the existence of a functional coupling between the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase and TRPC6. It also suggests that the abundance, distribution and activity of TRPC6 can be regulated by cardiotonic steroids like ouabain and the naturally occurring peptide Abeta(1-40) which underlines the pathophysiological significance of these processes.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia among elderly population. AD is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, which aggregate over time to form amyloid plaques in the brain. Reducing soluble Abeta levels and consequently amyloid plaques constitute an attractive therapeutic avenue to, at least, stabilize AD pathogenesis. The brain possesses several mechanisms involved in controlling cerebral Abeta levels, among which are the tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA)/plasmin system and microglia. However, these mechanisms are impaired and ineffective in AD. Here we show that the systemic chronic administration of recombinant t-PA (Activase rt-PA) attenuates AD-related pathology in APPswe/PS1 transgenic mice by reducing cerebral Abeta levels and improving the cognitive function of treated mice. Interestingly, these effects do not appear to be mediated by rt-PA-induced plasmin and matrix metalloproteinases 2/9 activation. We observed that rt-PA essentially mediated a slight transient increase in the frequency of patrolling monocytes in the circulation and stimulated microglia in the brain to adopt a neuroprotective phenotype, both of which contribute to Abeta elimination. Our study unraveled a new role of rt-PA in maintaining the phagocytic capacity of microglia without exacerbating the inflammatory response and therefore might constitute an interesting approach to stimulate the key populations of cells involved in Abeta clearance from the brain.",

This study was aimed to explore the role of natural compound icariin on the aggregation and the cytotoxicity of Abeta in vitro. METHODS: Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging were done to determine the influence of icariin on the aggregation of Abeta1-42 peptide. MTT assay was used to evaluate the protective effect of icariin on Abeta1-42 induced cytotoxicity in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. RESULTS: Icariin inhibited Abeta1-42 aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, icariin also prevented the cytotoxicity of Abeta1-42 in SH-SY5Y cells by decreasing the production of peroxide hydrogen during the aggregation of this peptide. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated a novel antagonistic role of icariin in the neurotoxicity of Abeta1-42 via inhibiting its aggregation, suggesting that icariin might have potential therapeutic benefits to delay or modify the progression of AD.",

    "abstract": "More than two hundred individuals developed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) worldwide as a result of treatment, typically in childhood, with human cadaveric pituitary-derived growth hormone contaminated with prions. Although such treatment ceased in 1985, iatrogenic CJD (iCJD) continues to emerge because of the prolonged incubation periods seen in human prion infections. Unexpectedly, in an autopsy study of eight individuals with iCJD, aged 36-51 years, in four we found moderate to severe grey matter and vascular amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology. The Abeta deposition in the grey matter was typical of that seen in Alzheimer's disease and Abeta in the blood vessel walls was characteristic of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and did not co-localize with prion protein deposition. None of these patients had pathogenic mutations, APOE epsilon4 or other high-risk alleles associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Examination of a series of 116 patients with other prion diseases from a prospective observational cohort study showed minimal or no Abeta pathology in cases of similar age range, or a decade older, without APOE epsilon4 risk alleles. We also analysed pituitary glands from individuals with Abeta pathology and found marked Abeta deposition in multiple cases. Experimental seeding of Abeta pathology has been previously demonstrated in primates and transgenic mice by central nervous system or peripheral inoculation with Alzheimer's disease brain homogenate. The marked deposition of parenchymal and vascular Abeta in these relatively young patients with iCJD, in contrast with other prion disease patients and population controls, is consistent with iatrogenic transmission of Abeta pathology in addition to CJD and suggests that healthy exposed individuals may also be at risk of iatrogenic Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. These findings should also prompt investigation of whether other known iatrogenic routes of prion transmission may also be relevant to Abeta and other proteopathic seeds associated with neurodegenerative and other human diseases.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of CSF biomarkers and amyloid PET for diagnosing early-stage Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: From the prospective, longitudinal BioFINDER study, we included 122 healthy elderly and 34 patients with mild cognitive impairment who developed AD dementia within 3 years (MCI-AD). beta-Amyloid (Abeta) deposition in 9 brain regions was examined with [18F]-flutemetamol PET. CSF was analyzed with INNOTEST and EUROIMMUN ELISAs. The results were replicated in 146 controls and 64 patients with MCI-AD from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. RESULTS: The best CSF measures for identifying MCI-AD were Abeta42/total tau (t-tau) and Abeta42/hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) (area under the curve [AUC] 0.93-0.94). The best PET measures performed similarly (AUC 0.92-0.93; anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate/precuneus, and global neocortical uptake). CSF Abeta42/t-tau and Abeta42/p-tau performed better than CSF Abeta42 and Abeta42/40 (AUC difference 0.03-0.12, p<0.05). Using nonoptimized cutoffs, CSF Abeta42/t-tau had the highest accuracy of all CSF/PET biomarkers (sensitivity 97%, specificity 83%). The combination of CSF and PET was not better than using either biomarker separately. CONCLUSIONS: Amyloid PET and CSF biomarkers can identify early AD with high accuracy. There were no differences between the best CSF and PET measures and no improvement when combining them. Regional PET measures were not better than assessing the global Abeta deposition. The results were replicated in an independent cohort using another CSF assay and PET tracer. The choice between CSF and amyloid PET biomarkers for identifying early AD can be based on availability, costs, and doctor/patient preferences since both have equally high diagnostic accuracy. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that amyloid PET and CSF biomarkers identify early-stage AD equally accurately.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complicated neurodegenerative disease which causes memory loss and dementia. Many researchers have revealed the vital roles of beta-amyloid proteins (Abeta) in the proceeds of AD. Abeta deposition in AD patients' brains might function as immune stimulus, and inflammation is believed to play an important role in AD pathologically. We experimentally used amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) transgenic (Tg) mice in this study to further clarify the neuroprotective effects of ginsenoside Rd on AD and its possible mechanisms. It was found that Rd could improve learning and memory ability in APP Tg mice, probably through inhibiting the transcription activity of NFkappaB. With the activation of the NFkappaB pathway being suppressed, the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the generation of protective factors had been increased ultimately. In conclusion, Rd had a neuroprotective effect on APP Tg mice, and it can be used as an alternative drug therapy in AD patients for their memory dysfunction.",

Decreasing the levels of Abeta oligomer, glial activation and oxidative stress are potential therapeutic approaches for AD treatment. We previously found alpha-tocopherol quinine (alpha-TQ) inhibited Abeta aggregation and cytotoxicity, decreased the release of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vitro. However, whether alpha-TQ ameliorates memory deficits and other neuropathologies in mice or patients with AD remains unknown. In this study, we reported that orally administered alpha-TQ ameliorated memory impairment in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice, decreased oxidative stress and the levels of Abeta oligomer in the brains of mice, prevented the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase and inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 and interleukin-1beta, and inhibited microglial activation by inhibiting NF-kappaB signaling pathway. These findings suggest that alpha-TQ has potential therapeutic value for AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "The excitatory amino acid transporters 1 and 2 (EAAT1 and EAAT2), mostly located on astrocytes, are the main mediators for glutamate clearance in humans. Malfunctions of these transporters may lead to excessive glutamate accumulation and subsequent excitotoxicity to neurons, which has been implicated in many kinds of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, the specific mechanism of the glutamate system dysregulation remains vague. To explore whether the insulin/protein kinase B (Akt)/EAAT signaling in human astrocytes could be disturbed by beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) and be protected by insulin, we incubated HA-1800 cells with varying concentrations of Abeta1-42 oligomers and insulin. Then the alterations of several key substrates in this signal transduction pathway were determined. Our results showed that expressions of insulin receptor, phospho-insulin receptor, phospho-protein kinase B, phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin, and EAAT1 and EAAT2 were decreased by the Abeta1-42 oligomers in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05) and this trend could be recovered by insulin treatment (p < 0.05). However, the expressions of total Akt and mTOR were invariant (p > 0.05), and the mRNA levels of EAAT1 and EAAT2 were also unchanged (p > 0.05). Taken together, this study indicates that Abeta1-42 oligomers could cause disturbances in insulin/Akt/EAAT signaling in astrocytes, which might be responsible for AD onset and progression. Additionally, insulin can exert protective functions to the brain by modulating protein modifications or expressions.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia associated with progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. Extracellular beta-amyloid (Abeta) is a major constituent of senile plaques, one of the pathological hallmarks of AD. Abeta deposition causes neuronal death via a number of possible mechanisms such as increasing oxidative stress. Therefore therapeutic approaches to identify novel Abeta aggregate reducers could be effective for AD treatment. Using a Trx-His-Abeta biochemical assay, we screened 11 synthetic indolylquinoline compounds, and found NC009-1, -2, -6 and -7 displaying potential to reduce Abeta aggregation. Treating Tet-On Abeta-GFP 293 cells with these compounds reduced Abeta aggregation and reactive oxygen species. These compounds also promoted neurite outgrowth in Tet-On Abeta-GFP SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, treatment with above compounds improved neuronal cell viability, neurite outgrowth, and synaptophysin expression level in mouse hippocampal primary culture under oligomeric Abeta-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, the tested NC009-1 significantly ameliorated Abeta-induced inhibition of hippocampal long-term potentiation in mouse hippocampal slices. Our results demonstrate how synthetic indolylquinoline compounds are likely to work as chemical chaperones in Abeta-aggregation reduction and neuroprotection, providing insight into the possible applications of indolylquinoline compounds in AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Successful maintenance of metabolic systems relating to accurate DNA replication and repair is critical for optimal lifelong human health. Should this homeostatic balance become impaired, genomic instability events can arise, compromising the integrity of the genome, which may result in gene expression and human disease. Both genome instability and micronutrient imbalance have been identified and implicated in diseases associated with accelerated ageing which potentially leads to an increased risk for the future development of clinically defined neurodegenerative disorders. Cognitive decline leading to the clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been shown to predict an increased risk in later life of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Knowledge on the impact of dietary factors in relation to MCI and AD risk is improving but incomplete; in particular the role of nutrient combinations (i.e. nutriomes) has not been thoroughly investigated. Currently, there is a need for preventative strategies as well as the identification of robust and reproducible diagnostic biomarkers that will allow identification of those individuals with increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases. Growing evidence suggests cells originating from different somatic tissues derived from individuals that have been clinically diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders exhibit elevated frequencies of DNA damage compared to tissues of cognitively normal individuals which could be due to malnutrition. The objective of this review is to discuss current evidence and identify knowledge gaps relating to genome instability biomarkers and blood micronutrient profiles from human studies of MCI and AD that may be specific to and contribute to the increased risk of these diseases. This is a vital step in order to create research strategies for the future development of diagnostics that are indicative of dementia risk and to inform preventative therapies.",

    "abstract": "Tau pathology is a pathological hallmark for several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. As a novel susceptibility gene for these 2 diseases, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) gene encodes an immune receptor that is uniquely expressed by microglia. Recently, a correlation between TREM2 expression and hyperphosphorylated tau has been revealed in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients, suggesting a potential association between TREM2 and tau pathology. However, the role of TREM2 in tau pathology remains unclear thus far. Herein, using P301S mice, we showed that TREM2 was upregulated in microglia during disease progression. Silencing of brain TREM2 exacerbated tau pathology in P301S mice. This exacerbation might be attributed to neuroinflammation-induced hyperactivation of tau kinases. Additionally, more severe neurodegenerative changes and spatial learning deficits were observed following TREM2 silencing. Our results imply that TREM2 attenuates tau kinase activity through restriction of neuroinflammation, and thus protects against tau pathology. These findings further suggest that TREM2 may represent as a potential therapeutic target for tau-related neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Neurogranin (NGRN) seems to be a promising novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker for synaptic loss; however, clinical, and especially longitudinal, data are sparse. OBJECTIVE: To examine the utility of NGRN, with repeated CSF sampling, for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal study of consecutive patients who underwent 2 lumbar punctures between the beginning of 1995 and the end of 2010 within the memory clinic-based Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. The study included 163 patients: 37 cognitively normal participants (mean [SE] age, 64 [2] years; 38% female; and mean [SE] Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score, 28 [0.3]), 61 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (mean [SE] age, 68 [1] years; 38% female; and mean [SE] MMSE score, 27 [0.3]), and 65 patients with AD (mean [SE] age, 65 [1] years; 45% female; and mean [SE] MMSE score, 22 [0.7]). The mean (SE) interval between lumbar punctures was 2.0 (0.1) years, and the mean (SE) duration of cognitive follow-up was 3.8 (0.2) years. Measurements of CSF NGRN levels were obtained in January and February 2014. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Levels of NGRN in CSF samples. RESULTS: Baseline CSF levels of NGRN in patients with AD (median level, 2381 pg/mL [interquartile range, 1651-3416 pg/mL]) were higher than in cognitively normal participants (median level, 1712 pg/mL [interquartile range, 1206-2724 pg/mL]) (P = .04). Baseline NGRN levels were highly correlated with total tau and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 in all patient groups (all P < .001), but not with Abeta42. Baseline CSF levels of NGRN were also higher in patients with MCI who progressed to AD (median level, 2842 pg/mL [interquartile range, 1882-3950 pg/mL]) compared with those with stable MCI (median level, 1752 pg/mL [interquartile range, 1024-2438 pg/mL]) (P = .004), and they were predictive of progression from MCI to AD (hazard ratio, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.1-2.9]; stratified by tertiles). Linear mixed-model analyses demonstrated that within-person levels of NGRN increased over time in cognitively normal participants (mean [SE] level, 90 [45] pg/mL per year; P < .05) but not in patients with MCI or AD. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Neurogranin is a promising biomarker for AD because levels were elevated in patients with AD compared with cognitively normal participants and predicted progression from MCI to AD. Within-person levels of NGRN increased in cognitively normal participants but not in patients with later stage MCI or AD, which suggests that NGRN may reflect presymptomatic synaptic dysfunction or loss.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the intervention effect of nicotine on beta-amyloid (Abeta)25-35 protein cytotoxicity in the rat basal forebrain neurons primary cultures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this purpose, freshly isolated rat basal forebrain neurons were cultured for 7 days and then exposed to either Abeta(25-35) or the combination of Abeta(25-35) and nicotine for 48 hours. The effects of Abeta(25-35) and nicotine on neurons morphology, growth status and TrkA expression were evaluated through microscopy, MTT assay, RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: We found that the exposure of cultured neurons to Abeta(25-35) resulted in remarkable morphological changes. The average process number and length as well as the maximum process length of neurons were significantly decreased as compared with those of control. MTT assay showed that Abeta(25-35) impaired the growth of neurons. Abeta(25-35) also inhibited the expression of TrkA at both mRNA and protein levels. However, the addition of nicotine significantly attenuated these changes, indicating that nicotine could protect the neurons from the cytotoxicity of Abeta(25-35). CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine could be useful for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease through its ability to rescue the neurons from Abeta(25-35) cytotoxicity and the protective effect involved upregulated expression of TrkA receptors.",

We developed ScaleS, a sorbitol-based optical clearing method that provides stable tissue preservation for immunochemical labeling and three-dimensional (3D) signal rendering. ScaleS permitted optical reconstructions of aged and diseased brain in Alzheimer's disease models, including mapping of 3D networks of amyloid plaques, neurons and microglia, and multi-scale tracking of single plaques by successive fluorescence and electron microscopy. Human clinical samples from Alzheimer's disease patients analyzed via reversible optical re-sectioning illuminated plaque pathogenesis in the z axis. Comparative benchmarking of contemporary clearing agents showed superior signal and structure preservation by ScaleS. These findings suggest that ScaleS is a simple and reproducible method for accurate visualization of biological tissue.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic dysfunction is linked to cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease. Thus, measurement of synapse proteins in cerebrospinal fluid may be useful biomarkers to monitor synaptic degeneration. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of the postsynaptic protein neurogranin are increased in Alzheimer's disease, including in the predementia stage of the disease. Here, we tested the performance of cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin to predict cognitive decline and brain injury in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. An in-house immunoassay was used to analyse neurogranin in cerebrospinal fluid samples from a cohort of patients who at recruitment were diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease with dementia (n = 95) or mild cognitive impairment (n = 173), as well as in cognitively normal subjects (n = 110). Patients with mild cognitive impairment were grouped into those that remained cognitively stable for at least 2 years (stable mild cognitive impairment) and those who progressed to Alzheimer's disease dementia during follow-up (progressive mild cognitive impairment). Correlations were tested between baseline cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin levels and baseline and longitudinal cognitive impairment, brain atrophy and glucose metabolism within each diagnostic group. Cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin was increased in patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia (P < 0.001), progressive mild cognitive impairment (P < 0.001) and stable mild cognitive impairment (P < 0.05) compared with controls, and in Alzheimer's disease dementia (P < 0.01) and progressive mild cognitive impairment (P < 0.05) compared with stable mild cognitive impairment. In the mild cognitive impairment group, high baseline cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin levels predicted cognitive decline as reflected by decreased Mini-Mental State Examination (P < 0.001) and increased Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (P < 0.001) scores at clinical follow-up. In addition, high baseline cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin levels in the mild cognitive impairment group correlated with longitudinal reductions in cortical glucose metabolism (P < 0.001) and hippocampal volume (P < 0.001) at clinical follow-up. Furthermore, within the progressive mild cognitive impairment group, elevated cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin levels were associated with accelerated deterioration in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (beta = 0.0017, P = 0.01). These data demonstrate that cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin is increased already at the early clinical stage of Alzheimer's disease and predicts cognitive deterioration and disease-associated changes in metabolic and structural biomarkers over time.",

    "title": "Protective spin-labeled fluorenes maintain amyloid beta peptide in small oligomers and limit transitions in secondary structure.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence of extracellular plaques comprised of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides. Soluble oligomers of the Abeta peptide underlie a cascade of neuronal loss and dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease. Single particle analyses of Abeta oligomers in solution by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) were used to provide real-time descriptions of how spin-labeled fluorenes (SLFs; bi-functional small molecules that block the toxicity of Abeta) prevent and disrupt oligomeric assemblies of Abeta in solution. Furthermore, the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of untreated Abeta shows a continuous, progressive change over a 24-hour period, while the spectrum of Abeta treated with SLF remains relatively constant following initial incubation. These findings suggest the conformation of Abeta within the oligomer provides a complementary determinant of Abeta toxicity in addition to oligomer growth and size. Although SLF does not produce a dominant state of secondary structure in Abeta, it does induce a net reduction in beta secondary content compared to untreated samples of Abeta. The FCS results, combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and CD spectroscopy, demonstrate SLFs can inhibit the growth of Abeta oligomers and disrupt existing oligomers, while retaining Abeta as a population of smaller, yet largely disordered oligomers.",

We pooled these studies into a meta-analysis to determine the PCT diagnostic accuracy. All major databases were searched through March 2015. No date or language restrictions were applied. Eight studies (n = 616 pediatric patients) were included. Serum PCT assay was found to be very accurate for differentiating the etiology of pediatric meningitis with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.96 (95% CI = 0.92-0.98) and 0.89 (95% CI = 0.86-0.92), respectively. The pooled positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) for PCT were 7.5 (95% CI = 5.6-10.1), 0.08(95% CI = 0.04-0.14), 142.3 (95% CI = 59.5-340.4), and 0.97 (SE = 0.01), respectively. In 6 studies, PCT was found to be superior than CRP, whose DOR was only 16.7 (95%CI = 8.8-31.7). Our meta-analysis demonstrates that serum PCT assay is a highly accurate and powerful test for rapidly differentiating between bacterial and viral meningitis in children.",

    "abstract": "The use of scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to investigate silicon nanowires (SiNWs) is presented. SThM allows imaging of temperature distribution at the nanoscale, while KPFM images the potential distribution with AFM-related ultra-high spatial resolution. Both techniques are therefore suitable for imaging the resistance distribution. We show results of experimental examination of dual channel n-type SiNWs with channel width of 100 nm, while the channel was open and current was flowing through the SiNW. To investigate the carrier distribution in the SiNWs we performed SThM and KPFM scans. The SThM results showed non-symmetrical temperature distribution along the SiNWs with temperature maximum shifted towards the contact of higher potential. These results corresponded to those expressed by the distribution of potential gradient along the SiNWs, obtained using the KPFM method. Consequently, non-uniform distribution of resistance was shown, being a result of non-uniform carrier density distribution in the structure and showing the pinch-off effect. Last but not least, the results were also compared with results of finite-element method modeling.",

    "title": "Pharmacokinetic Properties of a Novel D-Peptide Developed to be Therapeutically Active Against Toxic beta-Amyloid Oligomers.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: It has been shown that amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers play an important role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). D3, a peptide consisting solely of D-enantiomeric amino acid residues, was developed to specifically eliminate Abeta oligomers and is therapeutically active in transgenic AD mice. D-peptides have several advantages over L-peptides, but little is known about their pharmacokinetic potential in vivo. Here, we analysed the pharmacokinetic properties of RD2, a rationally designed and potent D3 derivative. METHODS: The pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using (3)H-RD2 after administration via several routes in mice. The time dependent amount of radiolabelled RD2 was measured in plasma and several organ homogenates by liquid scintillation counting. Furthermore, binding to plasma proteins was estimated. RESULTS: RD2 penetrates into the brain, where it is thought to implement its therapeutic function. All administration routes result in a maximal brain concentration per dose (Cmax/D) of 0.06 (mug/g)/(mg/kg) with brain/plasma ratios ranging between 0.7 and 1.0. RD2 shows a small elimination constant and a long terminal half-life in plasma of more than 2 days. It also exhibits high bioavailability after i.p., s.c. or p.o. administration. CONCLUSIONS: These excellent pharmacokinetic properties confirm that RD2 is a very promising drug candidate for AD.",

    "abstract": "Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKs) and cdc2-like kinases (CLKs) are implicated in the onset and progression of Down syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). DYRK1A has emerged as a possible link between amyloid-beta (Abeta) and Tau, the major pathological proteins in AD. We here assessed the neuroprotective potential of a novel inhibitor of DYRKs/CLKs. The Leucettine L41, acting preferentially on DYRK1A, was tested in Abeta25-35-treated mice, a nontransgenic model of AD-like toxicity. We co-injected intracerebroventricularly oligomeric Abeta25-35 peptide and L41 in Swiss male mice. After 7 days, they were submitted to behavioral tests addressing spatial and non-spatial, short- and long-term memories. The oxidative stress, apoptotic markers, kinases involved in Tau phosphorylation, and synaptic integrity were analyzed by Western blot and ELISA in the hippocampus. L41, tested at 0.4, 1.2, 4 microg, prevented the Abeta25-35-induced memory deficits in the Y-maze, passive avoidance and water-maze tests, with the most active dose being 4 microg. The inhibitor prevented the Abeta25-35-induced oxidative stress, as revealed by measures of lipid peroxidation levels and reactive oxygen species accumulation, and abolished Abeta25-35-induced expression of pro-apoptotic markers. L41 prevented the Abeta25-35-induced decrease of AKT activation and increase of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) activation, resulting in a decrease of Tau phosphorylation. Finally, L41 restored Abeta25-35-reduced levels of synaptic markers. The novel DYRK1A-preferential inhibitor L41 therefore prevented Abeta25-35-induced memory impairments and neurotoxicity in the mouse hippocampus. These in vivo data highlighted particularly DYRK1A as a major kinase involved in Abeta pathology and suggested therapeutic developments for DYRK1A inhibitors in AD.",

In this study, the added value of another CSF Abeta-peptide (Abeta40), along with the core CSF markers t-Tau, p-Tau, and Abeta42, in the discrimination between two large dementia groups of Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD; n=107), Alzheimer's Disease (AD; n=107) and non-demented subjects (n=33) was evaluated. In FTLD, t-Tau and p-Tau were significantly increased in relation to controls, but lower than in AD, while Abeta42 was similar in FTLD and controls, but higher than in AD. Equally reduced Abeta40 levels were seen in both dementia groups, and therefore the combination of Abeta40 with core CSF biomarkers optimally discriminated FTLD and AD patients from controls. Abeta42 and t-Tau were selected as the best biomarker subset to differentiate FTLD from AD, with no added value of Abeta40 to the model. Diagnostic accuracy between FTLD and AD was still sub-optimal, with a significant percentage (23%) of FTLD patients, in particularly women, carrying an ApoE-epsilon4 allele, showing a CSF-AD biomarkers profile. Although CSF Abeta40 does not appear to have an additional value in the distinction between FTLD and AD, it increases the discrimination between subjects with dementia from controls.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 26 million people world-wide, and the number is increasing as life expectancy increases. Since the only reliable diagnosis for the pathology is histochemical post-mortem examination, there is a rather urgent need for reliable, sensitive and quick detection techniques. Amyloid beta, being one of the established and widely accepted biomarkers of AD is a target biomolecule. Herein, we present fabrication of a labelless impedimetric amyloid beta immunosensor on carbon DEP (disposable electrochemical printed) chip. Three types of amyloid beta impedimetric immunosensors were fabricated in a systematic step-wise manner in order to understand the effects that each surface modification chemistry had on detection sensitivity. We found that compared to a bare electrode, surface modification through formation of SAM of AuNPs increased sensitivity by approximately three orders of magnitude (LoD from 2.04 muM to 2.65 nM). A further modification using protein G, which helps orientate antibodies to an optimum position for interaction with antigen, lowered the LoD further to 0.57 nM. We have demonstrated that the presence of one of the most abundance proteins in biological fluids, bovine serum albumin (BSA), did not interfere with the sensitivity of the sensor. Since the DEP chips are disposable and the detection platform label-free, the developed sensor is relatively fast and cheap. These methods could easily be applied for detection of other antigens, with selection of the detection platform based on the desired for sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the structures of membrane bound proteins is critical to understanding their function in healthy and diseased states. We introduce a surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy technique which can determine the conformation of membrane-bound proteins, at low micromolar concentrations, and also in the presence of a substantial membrane-free fraction. Unlike conventional surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, our approach does not require immobilization of molecules, as it uses spontaneous binding of proteins to lipid bilayer-encapsulated Ag nanoparticles. We apply this technique to probe membrane-attached oligomers of Amyloid-beta40 (Abeta40), whose conformation is keenly sought in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Isotope-shifts in the Raman spectra help us obtain secondary structure information at the level of individual residues. Our results show the presence of a beta-turn, flanked by two beta-sheet regions. We use solid-state NMR data to confirm the presence of the beta-sheets in these regions. In the membrane-attached oligomer, we find a strongly contrasting and near-orthogonal orientation of the backbone H-bonds compared to what is found in the mature, less-toxic Abeta fibrils. Significantly, this allows a \"porin\" like beta-barrel structure, providing a structural basis for proposed mechanisms of Abeta oligomer toxicity.",

The focus of this work is on clearance of Abeta along artery walls, the failure of which may explain the accumulation of Abeta in Alzheimer's disease. Periarterial basement membranes form continuous channels from cerebral capillaries to major arteries on the surface of the brain. Arterial pressure pulses drive peristaltic flow in the basement membranes in the same direction as blood flow. Here we forward the hypothesis that flexible structures within the basement membrane, if oriented such they present greater resistance to forward than retrograde flow, may cause net reverse flow, advecting Abeta along with it. A solution was obtained for peristaltic flow with low Reynolds number, long wavelength compared to channel height and small channel height compared to vessel radius in a Darcy-Brinkman medium representing a square array of cylinders. Results show that retrograde flow is promoted by high cylinder volume fraction and low peristaltic amplitude. A decrease in cylinder concentration and/or an increase in amplitude, both of which may occur during ageing, can reduce retrograde flow or even cause a transition from retrograde to forward flow. Such changes may explain the accumulation of Abeta in the brain and in artery walls in Alzheimer's disease.",

Here, we measured levels of the major secreted AbetaPP processing products sAbetaPPalpha, sAbetaPPbeta, and Abeta species in postmortem collected ventricular CSF of 196 AD patients and 74 controls. In AD we identified Abeta42 to decrease continuously with progressing Braak stages, whereas Abeta40 was upregulated in early stages of the disease (Braak stage 4) and down-regulated with progressing pathology. Interestingly, both sAbetaPPalpha and sAbetaPPbeta were upregulated in AD as compared to controls (sAbetaPPalpha, p = 0.02; sAbetaPPbeta, p = 0.01). Moreover, we observed a strong positive correlation of both alternative AbetaPP processing products, sAbetaPPalpha and sAbetaPPbeta (r2= 0.781; p <  0.0001). Together, our results argue for generally enhanced AbetaPP processing in AD patients and emphasize the necessity of analyzing the roles of all AbetaPP processing products in AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that amyloid-beta (Abeta) modulate intracellular metabolic cascades and an intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and a cell surface NMDA receptor expression alteration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However most of these findings have been obtained by using non-physiological Abeta concentrations. The present study deals with the effect of low Abeta concentrations on cellular homeostasis. We used nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells and murine cortical neurons sequentially treated with low chronic monomeric or small oligomeric Abeta concentrations and high acute oligomeric Abeta concentrations to bring out a priming effect of chronic treatment on subsequently high Abeta concentrations-elicited cellular response. Both cell types indeed displayed an enhanced capacity to bind oligomeric Abeta after monomeric or small oligomeric Abeta application. Furthermore, the results show that monomeric Abeta1-42 application to the cells induces an increase of the Ca2+-response and of the membrane expression of the extrasynaptic subunit of the NMDA receptor GluN2B in PC12 cells, while the opposite effects were observed in cultured neurons. This suggests a sequential interaction of Abeta with the cellular plasma membrane involving monomers or small Abeta oligomers which would facilitate the binding of the deleterious high molecular Abeta oligomers. This mechanism would explain the slow progression of AD in the human nervous system and the deep gradient of neuronal death observed around the amyloid plaques in the nervous tissue.",

We have, for the first time, systematically analyzed samples of Abeta42 peptide supplied by five different companies (Anaspec, Invitrogen, Enzo, Sigma-Aldrich, and SynthAssist) and obtained evidence of significant variability, including lot to lot variations. All studied samples formed amyloid-like fibrils at pH3-6, and the fibrils contained cross-beta structures. Samples from Anaspec, Invitrogen, and Enzo formed one particular type of amyloid-like fibrils, while the samples from Sigma-Aldrich and SynthAssist formed another distinct type of fibrils. The observed polymorphism emphasizes the capacity of the Abeta42 peptide to act as a prion agent with varying structural characteristics.

Nevertheless, we have not yet understood the nature and mechanisms of the ischemic episodes triggering the onset of AD and how they influence its slow progression. The assumed connection between brain ischemia and the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide awaits to be clearly explained. In our research, we employed a rat cardiac arrest model to study the changes in gene expression of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) and its cleaving enzymes, beta- and gamma-secretases (including presenilins) in hippocampal CA1 sector, following transient 10-min global brain ischemia. The quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR assay demonstrated that the expression of all above genes that contribute to Abeta peptide generation was dysregulated during 30 days in postischemic hippocampal CA1 area. It suggests that studied Abeta peptide generation-related genes can be involved in AbetaPP metabolism, following global brain ischemia and will be useful to identify the molecular mechanisms underpinning that cerebral ischemia might be an etiological cause of AD via dysregulation of AbetaPP and its cleaving enzymes, beta- and gamma-secretases genes, and subsequently, it may increase Abeta peptide production and promote the gradual and slow development of AD neuropathology. Our data demonstrate that brain ischemia activates delayed neuronal death in hippocampus in an AbetaPP-dependent manner, thus defining a new and important mode of ischemic cell death.",

    "title": "Does Caffeine Consumption Modify Cerebrospinal Fluid Amyloid-beta Levels in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease?",
    "abstract": "Caffeine may be protective against Alzheimer's disease (AD) by modulating amyloid-beta (Abeta) metabolic pathways. The present work aimed to study a possible association of caffeine consumption with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, particularly Abeta. The study included 88 patients with AD or mild cognitive impairment. The consumption of caffeine and theobromine was evaluated using a validated food questionnaire. Quantification of caffeine and main active metabolites was performed with liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The levels of A(1-42), total tau, and phosphorylated tau in the CSF were determined using sandwich ELISA methods and other Abeta species, Abeta(X-38), Abeta(X-40), and Abeta(X-42), with the MSD Abeta Triplex assay. The concentration of caffeine was 0.79+-1.15 mug/mL in the CSF and 1.20+-1.88 mug/mL in the plasma. No correlation was found between caffeine consumption and Abeta42 in the CSF. However, a significant positive correlation was found between the concentrations of theobromine, both in the CSF and in the plasma, with Abeta42 in the CSF. Theobromine in the CSF was positively correlated with the levels of other xanthines in the CSF, but not in the plasma, suggesting that it may be formed by central metabolic pathways. In conclusion, caffeine consumption does not modify the levels of CSF biomarkers, and does not require to be controlled for when measuring CSF biomarkers in a clinical setting. Since theobromine is associated with a favorable Abeta profile in the CSF, the possibility that it might have a protective role in AD should be further investigated.",

Nine MCI patients, who converted to AD between two and five years, and nine healthy subjects underwent [11C]PIB and [18F]FDG PET scans at baseline and at 5 years. [11C]PIB uptake was clearly higher in MCI patients at baseline compared to controls and spread extensively to the cerebral cortex during the conversion to AD. [18F]FDG uptake was reduced especially in the temporal-parietal regions in MCI compared to controls at baseline, and widely over the cortex at the 5-year follow-up. The reduction in metabolism during the follow-up was significant in the posterior brain regions. In addition, brain amyloid load was positively associated with metabolism in posterior brain regions in MCI, but not after conversion to AD. The results suggest that there are interactions between brain amyloid accumulation and metabolism during the AD process, including a possible compensatory upregulation of posterior brain metabolism in the early phase.",

OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to determine CSF biomarker cut-points using positron emission tomography (PET) Abeta imaging screened subjects from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of aging, as well as correlate CSF analyte cut-points across a range of PET Abeta amyloid ligands. METHODS: Abeta pathology was determined by PET imaging, utilizing 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B, 18F-flutemetamol, or 18F-florbetapir, in 157 AIBL participants who also underwent CSF collection. Using an INNOTEST assay, cut-points were established (Abeta(1-42) >544 ng/L, T-tau <407 ng/L, and P-tau181P <78 ng/L) employing a rank based method to define a \"positive\" CSF in the sub-cohort of amyloid-PET negative healthy participants (n = 97), and compared with the presence of PET demonstrated AD pathology. RESULTS: CSF Abeta(1-42) was the strongest individual biomarker, detecting cognitively impaired PET positive mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/AD with 85% sensitivity and 91% specificity. The ratio of P-tau181P or T-tau to Abeta(1-42) provided greater accuracy, predicting MCI/AD with Abeta pathology with >=92% sensitivity and specificity. Cross-validated accuracy, using all three biomarkers or the ratio of P-tau or T-tau to Abeta(1-42) to predict MCI/AD, reached >=92% sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: CSF Abeta(1-42) levels and analyte combination ratios demonstrated very high correlation with PET Abeta imaging. Our study offers additional support for CSF biomarkers in the early and accurate detection of AD pathology, including enrichment of patient cohorts for treatment trials even at the pre-symptomatic stage.",

    "abstract": "Three major genetic isoforms of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4, exist in humans and lead to differences in susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigated the impact of human ApoE isoforms on brain metabolic pathways involved in glucose utilization and amyloid-beta (Abeta) degradation, two major areas that are significantly perturbed in preclinical AD. Hippocampal RNA samples from middle-aged female mice with targeted human ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4 gene replacement were comparatively analyzed with a qRT-PCR custom array for the expression of 85 genes involved in insulin/insulin-like growth factor (Igf) signaling. Consistent with its protective role against AD, ApoE2 brain exhibited the most metabolically robust profile among the three ApoE genotypes. When compared to ApoE2 brain, both ApoE3 and ApoE4 brains exhibited markedly reduced levels of Igf1, insulin receptor substrates (Irs), and facilitated glucose transporter 4 (Glut4), indicating reduced glucose uptake. Additionally, ApoE4 brain exhibited significantly decreased Pparg and insulin-degrading enzyme (Ide), indicating further compromised glucose metabolism and Abeta dysregulation associated with ApoE4. Protein analysis showed significantly decreased Igf1, Irs, and Glut4 in ApoE3 brain, and Igf1, Irs, Glut4, Pparg, and Ide in ApoE4 brain compared to ApoE2 brain. These data provide the first documented evidence that human ApoE isoforms differentially affect brain insulin/Igf signaling and downstream glucose and amyloid metabolic pathways, illustrating a potential mechanism for their differential risk in AD. A therapeutic strategy that enhances brain insulin/Igf1 signaling activity to a more robust ApoE2-like phenotype favoring both energy production and amyloid homeostasis holds promise for AD prevention and early intervention.",

OBJECTIVE: To test whether 'presenting SCD' participants in an academic memory clinic setting show increased brain Abeta deposition on imaging. METHODS: Fourteen patients (mean age 68.1, SD 4.0 years) diagnosed with subjective cognitive complaints with normal neuropsychological testing were recruited into a Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET study. Detailed self-report inventories and additional cognitive tests were administered. Results were compared to a reference cohort of cognitively normal volunteers (NC) from an independent neuroimaging study (mean age 73.6, SD 5.8 years). RESULTS: 57% (8/14) of SCD participants were PiB-positive by a sensitive, regionally-based definition, compared to 31% (26/84) of the NC cohort. SCD participants had significantly higher PiB retention (SUVR) than NC in three of six regions of interest: frontal cortex (p = 0.02), lateral temporal cortex (p = 0.02), and parietal cortex (p = 0.04). SCD participants showed measurable deviations on questionnaires reflecting high negative affect (i.e., depressive symptoms and neuroticism). Findings were suggestive that deficits on verbal associative binding may be specific to Abeta-positive versus Abeta-negative SCD. CONCLUSION: Older participants with SCD presenting to a memory clinic in this pilot study sample have higher brain Abeta deposition compared to normal aging study volunteers unselected on complaints. Further study of presenting SCD are warranted to determine the prognostic significance of Abeta deposition in this context.",

    "abstract": "The underlying genetic variations of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) cases remain largely unknown. A combination of genetic variations with variable penetrance and lifetime epigenetic factors may converge on transcriptomic alterations that drive LOAD pathological process. Transcriptome profiling using deep sequencing technology offers insight into common altered pathways regardless of underpinning genetic or epigenetic factors and thus represents an ideal tool to investigate molecular mechanisms related to the pathophysiology of LOAD. We performed directional RNA sequencing on high quality RNA samples extracted from hippocampi of LOAD and age-matched controls. We further validated our data using qRT-PCR on a larger set of postmortem brain tissues, confirming downregulation of the gene encoding substance P (TAC1) and upregulation of the gene encoding the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (SERPINE1). Pathway analysis indicates dysregulation in neural communication, cerebral vasculature, and amyloid-beta clearance. Beside protein coding genes, we identified several annotated and non-annotated long noncoding RNAs that are differentially expressed in LOAD brain tissues, three of them are activity-dependent regulated and one is induced by Abeta(1-42) exposure of human neural cells. Our data provide a comprehensive list of transcriptomics alterations in LOAD hippocampi and warrant holistic approach including both coding and non-coding RNAs in functional studies aimed to understand the pathophysiology of LOAD.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~22-nucleotide [nt]) noncoding RNAs that regulate biological processes at the post-transcriptional level. Dysregulation of specific miRNAs leads to impaired synaptic plasticity resulting in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation is the most important pathogenic factor for AD development. Therefore, focusing on Abeta-targeted miRNAs may have therapeutic implications for AD. We found that miR-34c, a miRNA that was previously reported to be upregulated in a transgenic AD model and patients, was significantly increased in hippocampal neurons exposed to Abeta. Western blots and luciferase assay confirmed that increased miR-34c was closely related to VAMP2 reduction. Furthermore, miR-34c blockade upregulated VAMP2 expression and rescued synaptic failure as well as learning and memory deficits caused by Abeta. The Abeta-miR-34c-VAMP2 pathway mediates the sustained VAMP2 reduction in AD patients and provides a novel underlying epigenetic mechanism for attenuation of Abeta toxicity in AD.",

AICD complexes with transcription factors in the nucleus, suggesting that this AbetaPP fragment serves as an active signaling effector that regulates downstream genes, although its nuclear targets are poorly defined. To further understand this potential signaling mechanism mediated by AbetaPP, we performed a transcriptomic identification of the Drosophila genome that is regulated by the fly AbetaPP orthologue in fly mushroom body neurons, which control learning- and memory-based behaviors. We find significant changes in expression of 245 genes, representing approximately 1.6% of the Drosophila genome, with the changes ranging from +6 fold to -40 fold. The largest class of responsive targets corresponds to non-protein coding genes and includes microRNAs that have been previously implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Several genes were identified in our Drosophila microarray analyses that have also emerged as putative AbetaPP targets in similar mammalian transcriptomic studies. Our results also indicate a role for AbetaPP in cellular pathways involving the regulation of Drosophila Casein Kinase II, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, RNA processing, and innate immunity. Our findings provide insights into the intracellular events that are regulated by AbetaPP activity in healthy neurons and that might become dysregulated as a result of abnormal AbetaPP proteolysis in AD.",

    "abstract": "Secreted soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta)38 is the second most prominent Abeta form next to Abeta40, and is found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. Recent studies have shown the importance of quantitation of CSF Abeta38 levels in combination with those of Abeta40 and Abeta42 to support the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other neurodegenerative diseases, and to facilitate drug discovery studies. However, the availability of reliable and specific Abeta38 monoclonal antibody is limited. Our first aim was to generate and partially characterize rabbit monoclonal antibody (RabmAb) to Abeta38. The antibody was specific to Abeta38, since it did not react with Abeta37, Abeta39, Abeta40, or Abeta42 in ELISA or immunoblotting. The antibody was sensitive enough to measure Abeta38 levels in plasma. Our second aim was to quantitate Abeta38 levels in plasma from older Down syndrome (DS) persons and age-matched controls. Persons with DS (35 years and older) have neuropathological changes characteristic of AD. Studies have shown that plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels are higher in older persons with DS than in controls. However, none examined Abeta38 levels in DS. Our quantitation data showed that, like Abeta40 and Abeta42 plasma levels, Abeta38 plasma levels were higher in DS than in controls. Longitudinal studies will determine whether plasma Abeta38 levels in combination with levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42 are useful to predict early signs of AD in DS.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a growing consensus that disease-modifying therapies must be given at the prodromal or preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to be effective. A major unmet need is to develop and validate sensitive measures to track disease progression in these populations. OBJECTIVE: To generate novel statistically-derived composites from standard scores, which have increased sensitivity in the assessment of change from baseline in prodromal AD. METHODS: An empirically based method was employed to generate domain specific, global, and cognitive-functional novel composites. The novel composites were compared and contrasted with each other, as well as standard scores for their ability to track change from baseline. The longitudinal characteristics and power to detect decline of the measures were evaluated. Data from participants in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study characterized as mild cognitively impaired with high neocortical amyloid-beta burden were utilized for the study. RESULTS: The best performing standard scores were CDR Sum-of-Boxes and MMSE. The statistically-derived novel composites performed better than the standard scores from which they were derived. The domain-specific composites generally did not perform as well as the global composites or the cognitive-functional composites. CONCLUSION: A systematic method was employed to generate novel statistically-derived composite measures from standard scores. Composites comprised of measures including function and multiple cognitive domains appeared to best capture change from baseline. These composites may be useful to assess progression or lack thereof in prodromal AD. However, the results should be replicated and validated using an independent clinical sample before implementation in a clinical trial.",

    "title": "Development of Immunoassays for the Quantitative Assessment of Amyloid-beta in the Presence of Therapeutic Antibody: Application to Pre-Clinical Studies.",
    "abstract": "Utilizing decision making biomarkers in drug development requires thorough assay validation. Special considerations need to be taken into account when monitoring biomarkers using immunoassays in the presence of therapeutic antibodies. We have developed robust and sensitive assays to assess target engagement and proof of mechanism to support the clinical progression of a human monoclonal antibody against the neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta)42 peptide. Here we present the introduction of novel pre-treatment steps to ensure drug-tolerant immunoassays and describe the validation of the complete experimental procedures to measure total Abeta42 concentration (bound and unbound) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, free Abeta42 concentration (unbound) in CSF, and Abeta40 concentration in CSF. The difference in composition of the matrices (CSF and plasma) and antigen levels therein, in combination with the hydrophobic properties of Abeta protein, adds to the complexity of validation. Monitoring pharmacodynamics of an Abeta42 specific monoclonal antibody in a non-human primate toxicology study using these assays, we demonstrated a 1500-fold and a 3000-fold increase in total Abeta42 in plasma, a 4-fold and 8-fold increase in total Abeta42 in CSF together with a 95% and 96% reduction of free Abeta42 in CSF following weekly intravenous injections of 10 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg, respectively. Levels of Abeta40 were unchanged. The accuracy of these data is supported by previous pre-clinical studies as well as predictive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics modeling. In contrast, when analyzing the same non-human primate samples excluding the pre-treatment steps, we were not able to distinguish between free and total Abeta42. Our data clearly demonstrate the importance of thorough evaluation of antibody interference and appropriate validation to monitor different types of biomarkers in the presence of a therapeutic antibody.",

    "title": "A Unified Hypothesis of Early- and Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis.",
    "abstract": "Early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (EOFAD) and late-onset sporadic AD (LOSAD) both follow a similar pathological and biochemical course that includes: neuron and synapse loss and dysfunction, microvascular damage, microgliosis, extracellular amyloid-beta deposition, tau phosphorylation, formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, endoreduplication and related cell cycle events in affected brain regions. Any mechanistic explanation of AD must accommodate these biochemical and neuropathological features for both forms of the disease. In this insight paper we provide a unifying hypothesis for EOFAD and LOSAD that proposes that the aberrant re-entry of terminally differentiated, post-mitotic neurons into the cell division cycle is a common pathway that explains both early and late-onset forms of AD. Cell cycle abnormalities appear very early in the disease process, prior to the appearance of plaques and tangles, and explain the biochemical (e.g. tau phosphorylation), neuropathological (e.g. neuron hypertrophy; polypoidy) and cognitive changes observed in EOFAD and LOSAD. Genetic mutations in AbetaPP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 that alter amyloid-beta precursor protein and Notch processing drive reactivation of the cell cycle in EOFAD, while age-related reproductive endocrine dyscrasia that upregulates mitogenic TNF signaling and AbetaPP processing toward the amyloidogenic pathway drives reactivation of the cell cycle in LOSAD. In essence, AbetaPP and presenilin mutations initiate early, what endocrine dyscrasia initiates later: aberrant cell cycle re-entry of post-mitotic neurons leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD. Inhibition of cell cycle re-entry in post-mitotic neurons may be a useful therapeutic strategy to prevent, slow or halt disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral amyloid-beta accumulation and changes in white matter (WM) microstructure are imaging characteristics in clinical Alzheimer's disease and have also been reported in cognitively healthy older adults. However, the relationship between amyloid deposition and WM microstructure is not well understood. Here, we investigated the impact of quantitative cerebral amyloid load on WM microstructure in a group of cognitively healthy older adults. AV45-positron emission tomography and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans of forty-four participants (age-range: 60 to 89 years) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were analyzed. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (DR), and axial diffusivity (DA) were calculated to characterize WM microstructure. Regression analyses demonstrated non-linear (quadratic) relationships between amyloid deposition and FA, MD, as well as RD in widespread WM regions. At low amyloid burden, higher deposition was associated with increased FA as well as decreased MD and DR. At higher amyloid burden, higher deposition was associated with decreased FA as well as increased MD and DR. Additional regression analyses demonstrated an interaction effect between amyloid load and global WM FA, MD, DR, and DA on cognition, suggesting that cognition is only affected when amyloid is increasing and WM integrity is decreasing. Thus, increases in FA and decreases in MD and RD with increasing amyloid load at low levels of amyloid burden may indicate compensatory processes that preserve cognitive functioning. Potential mechanisms underlying the observed non-linear association between amyloid deposition and DTI metrics of WM microstructure are discussed.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence suggests that nutraceuticals with prolongevity properties may delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We recently demonstrated that a proanthocyanidins-standardized cranberry extract has properties that prolong life span and promote innate immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans In this article, we report that supplementation of this cranberry extract delayed Abeta toxicity-triggered body paralysis in the C elegans AD model. Genetic analyses indicated that the cranberry-mediated Abeta toxicity alleviation required heat shock transcription factor (HSF)-1 rather than DAF-16 and SKN-1. Moreover, cranberry supplementation increased the transactivity of HSF-1 in an IIS-dependent manner. Further studies found that the cranberry extract relies on HSF-1 to significantly enhance the solubility of proteins in aged worms, implying an improved proteostasis in AD worms. Considering that HSF-1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining proteostasis, our results suggest that cranberry maintains the function of proteostasis through HSF-1, thereby protecting C elegans against Abeta toxicity. Together, our findings elucidated the mechanism whereby cranberry attenuated Abeta toxicity in C elegans and stressed the significance of proteostasis in the prevention of age-related diseases from a practical point of view.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease coincides with the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques composed of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. Abeta is typically 40 residues long (Abeta(1-40)) but can have variable C and N termini. Naturally occurring N-terminally truncated Abeta(11-40/42) is found in the cerebrospinal fluid and has a similar abundance to Abeta(1-42), constituting one-fifth of the plaque load. Based on its specific N-terminal sequence we hypothesized that truncated Abeta(11-40/42) would have an elevated affinity for Cu(2+). Various spectroscopic techniques, complemented with transmission electron microscopy, were used to determine the properties of the Cu(2+)-Abeta(11-40/42) interaction and how Cu(2+) influences amyloid fiber formation. We show that Cu(2+)-Abeta(11-40) forms a tetragonal complex with a 34 +- 5 fm dissociation constant at pH 7.4. This affinity is 3 orders of magnitude tighter than Cu(2+) binding to Abeta(1-40/42) and more than an order of magnitude tighter than that of serum albumin, the extracellular Cu(2+) transport protein. Furthermore, Abeta(11-40/42) forms fibers twice as fast as Abeta(1-40) with a very different morphology, forming bundles of very short amyloid rods. Substoichiometric Cu(2+) drastically perturbs Abeta(11-40/42) assembly, stabilizing much longer fibers. The very tight fm affinity of Cu(2+) for Abeta(11-40/42) explains the high levels of Cu(2+) observed in Alzheimer disease plaques.",

Previous pathological studies reported particularly severe CAA with postcodon 200 PSEN1 mutations and amyloid beta coding domain APP mutations. As CAA may manifest as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on magnetic resonance imaging, particularly posteriorly, we investigated WMH in 52 symptomatic FAD patients for associations with mutation position. WMH were visually rated in 39 PSEN1 (18 precodon 200); 13 APP mutation carriers and 25 healthy controls. Ten PSEN1 mutation carriers (5 precodon 200) had postmortem examination. Increased WMH were observed in the PSEN1 postcodon 200 group and in the single APP patient with an amyloid beta coding domain (p.Ala692Gly, Flemish) mutation. WMH burden on MRI correlated with severity of CAA and cotton wool plaques in several areas. The precodon 200 group had younger ages at onset, decreased axonal density and/or integrity, and a greater T-lymphocytic response in occipital deep white matter.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Brain amyloid deposition is one of the key pathological hallmarks underlying the cognitive changes associated with Alzheimer's disease. Growing interest has been given to the earliest clinical manifestations of amyloid plaques. However, the relationship between amyloid status and activities of everyday function remains largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the relationship between instrumental activities of daily living performance (using the ADL-PI score) and amyloid status in older adults. METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses of data from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) were performed. Volunteers underwent a brain 18F-AV45 positron emission tomography examination. Bivariate analysis and regression models were conducted to study the relationships between brain amyloid deposition and the total ADL-PI score. RESULTS: We included 271 participants (women = 60%; age = 76+-4 years). Amyloid positron emission tomography was positive (standard uptake value >=1.17) for 103 participants (38%). The ADL-PI score was lower in amyloid positive participants than in their amyloid negative counterparts (38.8 vs 40.3, p = .007). This association was also confirmed in regression models adjusted for age, gender, and familial history of Alzheimer's disease (odds ratio = 0.94; 95% confidence interval 0.89-0.99; p = .02). This finding was consistent in cognitively normal individuals and in those with mild cognitive impairment, using the clinical dementia rating scale. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted an association between early functional limitations and brain amyloid deposition in elderly subjects. These symptoms could be the clinical manifestations of amyloid plaques even in the absence of overt dementia. Further prospective studies are warranted for examining the evolution of ADL-PI score over the course of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Early oligomers are crucial in amyloid aggregation; however, due to their transient nature they are among the least structurally characterized species. We focused on the amyloidogenic protein beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) whose early oligomers are still a matter of debate. An intermolecular interaction between D strands of facing beta2m molecules was repeatedly observed, suggesting that such interface may be relevant for beta2m dimerization. In this study, by mutating Ser33 to Cys, and assembling the disulphide-stabilized beta2m homodimer (DimC33), such DD strand interface was locked. Although the isolated DimC33 display a stability similar to wt beta2m under native conditions, it shows enhanced amyloid aggregation propensity. Three distinct crystal structures of DimC33 suggest that dimerization through the DD interface is instrumental for enhancing DimC33 aggregation propensity. Furthermore, the crystal structure of DimC33 in complex with the amyloid-specific dye Thioflavin-T pinpoints a second interface, which likely participates in the first steps of beta2m aggregation. The present data provide new insight into beta2m early steps of amyloid aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. The recent evidence in AD research suggests that alterations in the microRNA (miRNA) could contribute to risk for the disease. However, little is understood about the roles of miRNAs in cognitive impairment of early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we used 5-month-old APP/PS1 mice, which mimic many of the salient features of the early stage of AD pathological process, to further investigate the roles of miRNAs in synaptic loss involved in learning and memory. We used miRNA expression microarrays on RNA extracted from the hippocampus of 5-month-old APP/PS1 mice and wild type mice. Real-time reverse transcription PCR was conducted to verify the candidate miRNAs discovered by microarray analysis. The data showed that miR-574 was increased significantly in the hippocampus of 5-month-old APP/PS1 mice, which were concomitant with that APP/PS1 mice at the same age displayed a significant synaptic loss and cognitive deficits. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that neuritin (Nrn1) mRNA is targeted by miR-574. Overexpression of miR-574 lowers the levels of neuritin and synaptic proteins expression in primary hippocampal neurons damage induced by Abeta25-35. And the expression of miR-574 was also up-regulated in the hippocampal neurons from APP/PS1 mice compared with WT littermates. In contrast, suppression of miR-574 by miR-574 inhibitor significantly results in higher levels of neuritin and synaptic proteins expression. Taken together, miR-574 is involved in cognitive impairment in 5-month-old APP/PS1 mice through regulation of neuritin.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common reason for elderly dementia in the world. We proposed that memory loss in AD is related to destabilization of mushroom postsynaptic spines involved in long-term memory storage. We demonstrated previously that stromal interaction molecule 2 (STIM2)-regulated neuronal store-operated calcium entry (nSOC) in postsynaptic spines play a key role in stability of mushroom spines by maintaining activity of synaptic Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII). Furthermore, we demonstrated previously that the STIM2-nSOC-CaMKII pathway is downregulated in presenilin 1 M146V knock-in (PS1-M146V KI) mouse model of AD, leading to loss of hippocampal mushroom spines in this model. In the present study, we demonstrate that hippocampal mushroom postsynaptic spines are also lost in amyloid precursor protein knock-in (APPKI) mouse model of AD. We demonstrated that loss of mushroom spines occurs as a result of accumulation of extracellular beta-amyloid 42 in APPKI culture media. Our results indicate that extracellular Abeta42 acts by overactivating mGluR5 receptor in APPKI neurons, leading to elevated Ca(2+) levels in endoplasmic reticulum, compensatory downregulation of STIM2 expression, impaired synaptic nSOC, and reduced CaMKII activity. Pharmacological inhibition of mGluR5 or overexpression of STIM2 rescued synaptic nSOC and prevented mushroom spine loss in APPKI hippocampal neurons. Our results indicate that downregulation of synaptic STIM2-nSOC-CaMKII pathway causes loss of mushroom synaptic spines in both presenilin and APPKI mouse models of AD. We propose that modulators/activators of this pathway may have a potential therapeutic value for treatment of memory loss in AD. Significance statement: A direct connection between amyloid-induced synaptic mushroom spine loss and neuronal store-operated calcium entry pathway is shown. These results provide strong support for the calcium hypothesis of neurodegeneration and further validate the synaptic store-operated calcium entry pathway as a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Ca(2+) Interacts with Glu-22 of Abeta(1-42) and Phospholipid Bilayers to Accelerate the Abeta(1-42) Aggregation Below the Critical Micelle Concentration.",
    "abstract": "The amyloid cascade hypothesis links the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide aggregation to neuronal cell damage and ultimately the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although Abeta aggregation has been known to accelerate at cell membranes, the exact mechanism of Abeta peptide deposition and the involvement of extracellular species are still largely unclear. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), we demonstrate that Ca(2+) ions, in conjunction with lipid bilayer, lower the threshold concentration for Abeta aggregation (>a few micromolar in vitro) to physiological levels (low nanomolar). Circular dichroism spectroscopy reveals that Ca(2+) ions and the lipid bilayer concertedly accelerate the conformational change or misfolding of Abeta peptides. Molecular dynamics calculation indicates that Ca(2+) is sandwiched between Glu-22 of Abeta and the lipid phosphate group. SPR experiments conducted using an E22G mutant confirmed the strong interaction among Ca(2+), Abeta(1-42), and the phospholipid bilayer. With the C- and N-termini of the Abeta dimer fully exposed for the attachment of additional Abeta molecules, fibrils formed with the Ca(2+)-anchored Abeta nuclei appear to interact with lipid bilayers differently from those preformed in solution. Thus, similar to the role of Ca(2+) in enriching islet amyloid polypeptides in the pancreas of diabetic patients ( Biophys. J. 2013 , 104 , 173 - 184 ) and the \"Ca(2+) bridge\" in mediating membrane interaction with alpha-synuclein in the Parkinson's disease ( Biochemistry , 2006 , 45 , 10947 - 10956 ), the influence of Ca(2+) on the Abeta adsorption at cell membranes, which leads to neuronal membrane damage in AD, cannot be overlooked.",

    "title": "Glimepiride protects neurons against amyloid-beta-induced synapse damage.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is associated with the accumulation within the brain of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides that damage synapses and affect memory acquisition. This process can be modelled by observing the effects of Abeta on synapses in cultured neurons. The addition of picomolar concentrations of soluble Abeta derived from brain extracts triggered the loss of synaptic proteins including synaptophysin, synapsin-1 and cysteine string protein from cultured neurons. Glimepiride, a sulphonylurea used for the treatment of diabetes, protected neurons against synapse damage induced by Abeta. The protective effects of glimepiride were multi-faceted. Glimepiride treatment was associated with altered synaptic membranes including the loss of specific glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins including the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) that acts as a receptor for Abeta42, increased synaptic gangliosides and altered cell signalling. More specifically, glimepiride reduced the Abeta-induced increase in cholesterol and the Abeta-induced activation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) in synapses that occurred within cholesterol-dense membrane rafts. Abeta42 binding to glimepiride-treated neurons was not targeted to membrane rafts and less Abeta42 accumulated within synapses. These studies indicate that glimepiride modified the membrane micro-environments in which Abeta-induced signalling leads to synapse damage. In addition, soluble PrP(C), released from neurons by glimepiride, neutralised Abeta-induced synapse damage. Such observations raise the possibility that glimepiride may reduce synapse damage and hence delay the progression of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Antibodies directed against Amyloid Beta (Abeta) are able to successfully clear plaques and reverse cognitive deficits in mouse models. Excitement towards this approach has been tempered by high profile failures in the clinic, one key issue has been the development of inflammatory side effects in the brain (ARIAs). New antibodies are entering the clinic for Alzheimer's disease; therefore, it is important to learn all we can from the current generation. In this study, we directly compared 3 clinical candidates in the same pre-clinical model, with the same effector function, for their ability to clear plaques and induce inflammation in the brain. We produced murine versions of the antibodies: Bapineuzumab (3D6), Crenezumab (mC2) and Gantenerumab (chGantenerumab) with an IgG2a constant region. 18-month transgenic APP mice (Tg2576) were injected bilaterally into the hippocampus with 2 microg of each antibody or control. After 7 days, the mice tissue was analysed for clearance of plaques and neuroinflammation by histology and biochemical analysis. 3D6 was the best binder to plaques and in vitro, whilst mC2 bound the least strongly. This translated into 3D6 effectively clearing plaques and reducing the levels of insoluble Abeta, whilst chGantenerumab and mC2 did not. 3D6 caused a significant increase in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNFalpha, and an associated increase in microglial expression of CD11B and CD68. chGantenerumab increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglial activation, but minimal changes in CD68, as an indicator of phagocytosis. Injection of mC2 did not cause any significant inflammatory changes. Our results demonstrate that the ability of an antibody to clear plaques and induce inflammation is dependent on the epitope and affinity of the antibody.",

    "title": "Caregiver burden in atypical dementias: comparing frontotemporal dementia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Caregiver burden is a significant issue in the treatment of dementia and a known contributor to institutionalization of patients with dementia. Published data have documented increased caregiver burden in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) compared to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Another atypical dementia with high-perceived caregiver burden is sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), but no formal studies have assessed this perception. The aim of this study was to compare caregiver burden across atypical dementia etiologies. METHODS: 76 adults with atypical dementia (young-onset AD [YOAD], bvFTD, language variant FTD [lvFTD], and sCJD) were administered an abbreviated version of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-Q), and other assessment instruments during a five-year time period at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH). A Cox regression model examined differences between disease categories that impact mean ZBI scores. RESULTS: Mean ZBI scores were significantly different between dementia etiologies, with bvFTD and sCJD having the highest caregiver burden (p = 0.026). Mean NPI-Q caregiver distress scores were highest in bvFTD and sCJD (p = 0.002), with sCJD and bvFTD also having the highest number of endorsed symptom domains (p = 0.012). On regression analyses, an interactive variable combining final diagnosis category and NPI-Q total severity score demonstrated statistically significant differences in mean ZBI scores for sCJD and bvFTD. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that bvFTD and sCJD have increased levels of caregiver burden, NPI-Q caregiver distress, total severity scores, and number of endorsed symptom domains. These results suggest that higher caregiver burden in bvFTD and sCJD are disease specific and possibly related to neuropsychiatric symptoms.",

    "abstract": "A new series of fluoro-pegylated benzyloxybenzenes were designed, synthesized and evaluated as PET probes for early detection of Abeta plaques. Molecular docking revealed that all of the flexible benzyloxybenzenes inserted themselves into the hydrophobic Val18_Phe20 cleft on the flat spine of the Abeta fiber, in a manner similar to that of IMPY molecule. The most potent probe, [(18)F]9a, exhibited a combination of high binding affinity to Abeta aggregates (Ki = 21.0 +- 4.9 nM), high initial brain uptake (9.14% ID/g at 2 min), fast clearance from normal brain tissue (1.79% ID/g at 60 min), and satisfactory in vivo biostability in the brain (95% of intact form at 2 min). [(18)F]9a clearly labeled Abeta plaques in in vitro autoradiography of postmortem AD patients and Tg mice brain sections. Ex vivo autoradiography further demonstrated that [(18)F]9a did penetrate the intact BBB and specifically bind to Abeta plaques in vivo. Overall, [(18)F]9a may be a potential PET probe for imaging Abeta plaques in AD brains.",

Microglia, the primary phagocytes in the brain, are positively correlated with tau pathology, but their involvement in tau propagation is unknown. We developed an adeno-associated virus-based model exhibiting rapid tau propagation from the entorhinal cortex to the dentate gyrus in 4 weeks. We found that depleting microglia dramatically suppressed the propagation of tau and reduced excitability in the dentate gyrus in this mouse model. Moreover, we demonstrate that microglia spread tau via exosome secretion, and inhibiting exosome synthesis significantly reduced tau propagation in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that microglia and exosomes contribute to the progression of tauopathy and that the exosome secretion pathway may be a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Do different neurodegenerative maladies emanate from the failure of a mutual protein folding mechanism? We have addressed this question by comparing mutational patterns that are linked to the manifestation of distinct neurodegenerative disorders and identified similar neurodegeneration-linked proline substitutions in the prion protein and in presenilin 1 that underlie the development of a prion disorder and of familial Alzheimer's disease (fAD), respectively. These substitutions were found to prevent the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident chaperone, cyclophilin B, from assisting presenilin 1 to fold properly, leading to its aggregation, deposition in the ER, reduction of gamma-secretase activity, and impaired mitochondrial distribution and function. Similarly, reduced quantities of the processed, active presenilin 1 were observed in brains of cyclophilin B knockout mice. These discoveries imply that reduced cyclophilin activity contributes to the development of distinct neurodegenerative disorders, propose a novel mechanism for the development of certain fAD cases, and support the emerging theme that this disorder can stem from aberrant presenilin 1 function. This study also points at ER chaperones as targets for the development of counter-neurodegeneration therapies.",

    "abstract": "Targeting the early oligomerization of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is a promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, certain C-terminal fragments (CTFs) derived from Abeta42 were shown to be potent inhibitors of Abeta-induced toxicity. The shortest peptide studied, Abeta(39-42), has been shown to modulate Abeta oligomerization and inhibit Abeta toxicity. Understanding the mechanism of these CTFs, especially Abeta(39-42), is of significance for future therapeutic development of AD and peptidomimetic-based drug development. Here we used ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry to investigate the interactions between two modified Abeta(39-42) derivatives, VVIA-NH2 and Ac-VVIA, and full-length Abeta42. VVIA-NH2 was previously shown to inhibit Abeta toxicity, whereas Ac-VVIA did not. Our mass spectrometry analysis revealed that VVIA-NH2 binds directly to Abeta42 monomer and small oligomers while Ac-VVIA binds only to Abeta42 monomer. Ion mobility studies showed that VVIA-NH2 modulates Abeta42 oligomerization by not only inhibiting the dodecamer formation but also disaggregating preformed Abeta42 dodecamer. Ac-VVIA also inhibits and removes preformed Abeta42 dodecamer. However, the Abeta42 sample with the addition of Ac-VVIA clogged the nanospray tip easily, indicating that larger aggregates are formed in the solution in the presence of Ac-VVIA. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that VVIA-NH2 binds specifically to the C-terminal region of Abeta42 while Ac-VVIA binds dispersedly to multiple regions of Abeta42. This work implies that C-terminal interactions and binding to Abeta oligomers are important for C-terminal fragment inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the primary cause of dementia in the elderly. The ectodomain of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR-ECD) has been suggested to play important roles in regulating beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition and in protecting neurons from the toxicity of soluble Abeta. However, whether and how the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of p75NTR-ECD change in patients with AD are not well documented. In the present study, we determined the concentrations of serum p75NTR-ECD in an AD group, a Parkinson disease group and a stroke group, as well as in a group of elderly controls without neurological disorders (EC). We also determined the levels of CSF p75NTR-ECD in a subset of the AD and EC groups. Our data showed that a distinct p75NTR-ECD profile characterized by a decreased CSF level and an increased serum level was present concomitantly with AD patients but not with other diseases. p75NTR-ECD levels in both the serum and CSF were strongly correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and showed sound differential diagnostic value for AD. Moreover, when combining CSF Abeta42, CSF Abeta42/40, CSF ptau181 or CSF ptau181/Abeta42 with CSF p75NTR-ECD, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and diagnostic accuracies improved. These findings indicate that p75NTR-ECD can serve as a specific biomarker for AD and the determination of serum and CSF p75NTR-ECD levels is likely to be helpful in monitoring AD progression.",

    "abstract": "Recent neuroimaging studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have emphasized topographical similarities between AD-related brain changes and a prominent cortical association network called the default-mode network (DMN). However, the specificity of distinct imaging abnormalities for the DMN compared to other intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) of the limbic and heteromodal association cortex has not yet been examined systematically. We assessed regional amyloid load using AV45-PET, neuronal metabolism using FDG-PET, and gray matter volume using structural MRI in 473 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, including preclinical, predementia, and clinically manifest AD stages. Complementary region-of-interest and voxel-based analyses were used to assess disease stage- and modality-specific changes within seven principle ICNs of the human brain as defined by a standardized functional connectivity atlas. Amyloid deposition in AD dementia showed a preference for the DMN, but high effect sizes were also observed for other neocortical ICNs, most notably the frontoparietal-control network. Atrophic changes were most specific for an anterior limbic network, followed by the DMN, whereas other neocortical networks were relatively spared. Hypometabolism appeared to be a mixture of both amyloid- and atrophy-related profiles. Similar patterns of modality-dependent network specificity were also observed in the predementia and, for amyloid deposition, in the preclinical stage. These quantitative data confirm a high vulnerability of the DMN for multimodal imaging abnormalities in AD. However, rather than being selective for the DMN, imaging abnormalities more generally affect higher order cognitive networks and, importantly, the vulnerability profiles of these networks markedly differ for distinct aspects of AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "Studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have predominantly focused on two major pathologies: amyloid-beta (Abeta) and hyperphosphorylated tau. These misfolded proteins can accumulate asymptomatically in distinct regions over decades. However, significant Abeta accumulation can be seen in individuals who do not develop dementia, and tau pathology limited to the transentorhinal cortex, which can appear early in adulthood, is usually clinically silent. Thus, an interaction between these pathologies appears to be necessary to initiate and propel disease forward to widespread circuits. Recent multidisciplinary findings strongly suggest that the third factor required for disease progression is an aberrant microglial immune response. This response may initially be beneficial; however, a maladaptive microglial response eventually develops, fueling a feed-forward spread of tau and Abeta pathology.",

    "abstract": "According to the modified amyloid hypothesis, the key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the deposition of neurotoxic amyloid beta-peptides (Abetas) in plaques and cerebral blood vessels. Additionally to full-length peptides, a great diversity of N-truncated Abeta variants is derived from the larger amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP). Vast evidence suggests that Abeta x-42 isoforms play an important role in triggering neurodegeneration due to their high abundance, amyloidogenic propensity and toxicity. Although N-truncated Abeta peptides and Abeta x-42 species appear to be the crucial players in AD etiology, the Abeta 2-x isoforms did not receive much attention yet. The present study is the first to show immunohistochemical evidence of Abeta 2-x in cases of AD and its distribution in AbetaPP/PS1KI and 5XFAD transgenic mouse models using a novel antibody pAB77 that has been developed using Abeta 2-14 as antigen. Positive plaques and congophilic amyloid angiopathy (CAA) were observed in AD cases and in both mouse models. While in AD cases, abundant CAA and less pronounced plaque pathology was evident, the two mouse models showed predominantly extracellular Abeta deposits and minor CAA staining. Western blotting and a capillary isoelectric focusing immunoassay demonstrated the high specificity of the antibody pAb77 against Abeta-variants starting with the N-terminal Alanine-2.",

The results show that exposure of inclusion bodies to the dendrimers leads to its partial disaggregation and release of the nanosize protein-dendrimer complexes.

Although the use of immunoassays measuring Abeta1-38 and Abeta1-40 in addition to Abeta1-42 has increased, quantitative assays of other Abeta peptides remain rarely explored. We recently discovered novel Abeta peptides in CSF using antibodies recognizing the Abeta mid-domain region. Here we have developed a method using both Abeta N-terminal and mid-domain antibodies for immunoprecipitation in combination with isobaric labeling and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for relative quantification of endogenous Abeta peptides in CSF. The developed method was used in a pilot study to produce Abeta peptide profiles from 38 CSF samples. Statistical comparison between CSF samples from 19 AD patients and 19 cognitively healthy controls revealed no significant differences at group level. A significant correlation was found between several larger C-terminally truncated Abeta peptides and protein biomarkers for neuronal damage, particularly prominent in the control group. Comparison of the isobaric quantification with immunoassays measuring Abeta1-38 or Abeta1-40 showed good correlation (r(2) = 0.84 and 0.85, respectively) between the two analysis methods.

We found that the level of TSP-1 expression was decreased in AD brains. When we treated astrocytes with amyloid beta (Abeta), secreted TSP-1 was decreased in autophagy-dependent manner. In addition, treatment with Abeta induced synaptic pathology, such as decreased dendritic spine density and reduced synaptic activity. These effects were prevented by coincubation of TSP-1 with Abeta, which acts through the TSP-1 receptor alpha-2-delta-1 in neurons. Finally, intrasubicular injection with TSP-1 into AD model mouse brains mitigated the Abeta-mediated reduction of synaptic proteins and related signaling pathways.

    "abstract": "Arrested autophagy may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Because we found that chloroquine (CQ) causes arrested autophagy but clioquinol (ClioQ), a zinc ionophore, activates autophagic flux, in the present study, we examined whether ClioQ can overcome arrested autophagy induced by CQ or mutant presenilin-1 (mPS1). CQ induced vacuole formation and cell death in adult retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells, but co-treatment with ClioQ attenuated CQ-associated toxicity in a zinc-dependent manner. Increases in lysosome dilation and blockage of autophagic flux by CQ were also markedly attenuated by ClioQ treatment. Interestingly, CQ increased lysosomal pH in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/mPS1-expressing Chinese hamster ovary 7WDeltaE9 (CHO-7WDeltaE9) cell line, and ClioQ partially re-acidified lysosomes. Furthermore, accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers in CHO-7WDeltaE9 cells was markedly attenuated by ClioQ. Moreover, intracellular accumulation of exogenously applied fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Abeta(1-42) was also increased by CQ but was returned to control levels by ClioQ. These results suggest that modulation of lysosomal functions by manipulating lysosomal zinc levels may be a useful strategy for clearing intracellular Abeta oligomers.",

Lycopene, a member of the carotenoid family, has been identified as an antioxidant to attenuate oxidative damage and has neuroprotective role in several AD models. However, whether lycopene is involved in the pathogenesis of AD and molecular underpinnings are elusive. In this study, we found that lycopene can significantly delay paralysis in the Abeta1-42-transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans strain GMC101. Lycopene treatment reduced Abeta1-42 secretion in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing the Swedish mutant form of human beta-amyloid precursor protein (APPsw). Next, we found lycopene can down-regulate expression level of beta-amyloid precursor protein(APP) in APPsw cells. Moreover, lycopene treatment can not change endogenous reactive oxygen species level and apoptosis in APPsw cells. However, lycopene treatment protected against H2O2-induced oxidative stress and copper-induced damage in APPsw cells. Collectively, our data support that elevated lycopene contributes to the lower pathogenesis of AD. Our findings suggest that increasing lycopene in neurons may be a novel approach to attenuate onset and development of AD.",

Beta-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Abeta1-42) is not only the primary protein component of senile plaques in AD but also is believed to play an important part in its pathology. Increasing evidence has shown neuroinflammation and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is closely related to the pathogenesis of AD. The aim of the present study is to further elucidate whether Res prevents AD rats from inflammation induced by Abeta1-42 and protects the integrity of BBB. Rats were divided into six groups: (1) ovariectomized (OVX)+D-galactose (D-gal) 100mg/kg group (OVX+D-gal); (2-4) OVX, D-gal and Res 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg treated groups; and (5) OVX, D-gal and estradiol valerate 0.8 mg/kg treated group (ET); (6) Sham control group. 12 weeks later, Res 40 and 80 mg/kg treatment exhibited a significant decrease of Abeta1-42 compared with the OVX+D-gal rats of hippocampus, which was accompanied by decreased expression of advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), matrix metalloprotein-9 (MMP-9), nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and the increase of Claudin-5. These results suggest that Res is useful not only in protecting OVX+D-gal rats from neuroinflammation mediated by Abeta1-42 by decreasing the expression of NF-kappaB but also the integrity of BBB by increasing Claudin-5 and decreasing RAGE, MMP-9.",

Here, we demonstrate that the conditional ablation of resident microglia in CD11b-HSVTK (TK) mice is followed by a rapid repopulation of the brain by peripherally derived myeloid cells. We used this system to directly assess the ability of peripheral macrophages to reduce Abeta plaque pathology and therefore depleted and replaced the pool of resident microglia with peripherally derived myeloid cells in Abeta-carrying APPPS1 mice crossed to TK mice (APPPS1;TK). Despite a nearly complete exchange of resident microglia with peripheral myeloid cells, there was no significant change in Abeta burden or APP processing in APPPS1;TK mice. Importantly, however, newly recruited peripheral myeloid cells failed to cluster around Abeta deposits. Even additional anti-Abeta antibody treatment aimed at engaging myeloid cells with amyloid plaques neither directed peripherally derived myeloid cells to amyloid plaques nor altered Abeta burden. These data demonstrate that mere recruitment of peripheral myeloid cells to the brain is insufficient in substantially clearing Abeta burden and suggest that specific additional triggers appear to be required to exploit the full potential of myeloid cell-based therapies for AD.",

Although aggregation-preventing strategies involving ligands are known, understanding the mechanism of TTR aggregation can lead to additional inhibition approaches. Several models of TTR amyloid fibrils have been proposed, but the segments that drive aggregation of the protein have remained unknown.

As the most abundant protein in blood plasma and in cerebrospinal fluid, human serum albumin (HSA) can bind Abeta in vivo and subsequently inhibit Abeta fibril growth. However, the roles of albumin in Cu-induced Abeta aggregation and toxicity, and its potential biological relevance to AD therapy, were not stressed enough. Here, we showed that HSA was capable of binding Cu (I) with much higher affinity than Abeta, competitively inhibiting the interaction of Abeta and Cu ions. In the presence of biological reducing agent ascorbate, HSA inhibited Cu (II)/Cu (I)-mediated Abeta40 aggregation, reactive oxygen species production, and neurotoxicity. However, in the absence of Cu (II)/Cu (I), HSA could not effectively inhibit Abeta40 aggregation and neurotoxicity at 24 h (or less) incubation time, but decreased Abeta40 aggregation at much longer incubation (120 h). Our data suggested that through competitively decreasing Cu-Abeta interaction, HSA could effectively inhibit Cu (II)/Cu (I)-induced Abeta40 aggregation and neurotoxicity, and play important roles in regulating redox balance as well as metal homeostasis in AD prevention and therapy.",

All these changes lead to a markedly increased accumulation of Abeta42 in brain cortical tissue of aged rats. Long-term dietary supplementation of rats with a combination of N-acetylcysteine, alpha-lipoic and alpha-tocopherol from 18 months onwards daily till the sacrifice of the animals by 22-24 months, attenuates the age-related alterations in amyloid beta metabolism. In separate experiments, a significant impairment of spatial learning and memory has been observed in aged rats, and the phenomenon is remarkably prevented by the dietary supplementation of the aged animals by the same combination of N-acetylcysteine, alpha-lipoic acid and alpha-tocopherol. The results call for further explorations of this combination in suitable animal models in ameliorating AD related brain deficits.",

    "abstract": "The orphan G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptor (GPCR) GPR3 regulates activity of the gamma-secretase complex in the absence of an effect on Notch proteolysis, providing a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, given the vast resources required to develop and evaluate any new therapy for AD and the multiple failures involved in translational research, demonstration of the pathophysiological relevance of research findings in multiple disease-relevant models is necessary before initiating costly drug development programs. We evaluated the physiological consequences of loss of Gpr3 in four AD transgenic mouse models, including two that contain the humanized murine Abeta sequence and express similar amyloid precursor protein (APP) levels as wild-type mice, thereby reducing potential artificial phenotypes. Our findings reveal that genetic deletion of Gpr3 reduced amyloid pathology in all of the AD mouse models and alleviated cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice. Additional three-dimensional visualization and analysis of the amyloid plaque burden provided accurate information on the amyloid load, distribution, and volume in the structurally intact adult mouse brain. Analysis of 10 different regions in healthy human postmortem brain tissue indicated that GPR3 expression was stable during aging. However, two cohorts of human AD postmortem brain tissue samples showed a correlation between elevated GPR3 and AD progression. Collectively, these studies provide evidence that GPR3 mediates the amyloidogenic proteolysis of APP in four AD transgenic mouse models as well as the physiological processing of APP in wild-type mice, suggesting that GPR3 may be a potential therapeutic target for AD drug development.",

    "title": "Effects of amyloid and vascular markers on cognitive decline in subcortical vascular dementia.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the independent and synergistic effects of amyloid and small vessel disease (SVD) burden on longitudinal cognitive decline in patients with subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD). METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study was conducted involving patients from outpatient clinics of 2 tertiary referral centers. Sixty-one patients with SVaD were prospectively recruited and underwent MRI, 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET at baseline, and a 3-year annual neuropsychological follow-up. Effects of PiB positivity and SVD markers (white matter hyperintensities [WMH], lacunes, and microbleeds) on longitudinal cognitive decline were evaluated using generalized estimation equation after controlling for age, sex, education, APOE4 allele, and follow-up interval. RESULTS: When individual neuropsychological tests were used as outcome measures, PiB positivity was associated with faster cognitive decline in attention, visuospatial, visual memory, and global cognition function. Higher WMH burden was associated with faster cognitive decline in attention, visuospatial, visual recognition memory, and semantic/phonemic fluency function, whereas lacunes and microbleeds had no significant effects. When global dementia rating (Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes) was considered as an outcome measure, however, only PiB positivity was associated with faster cognitive decline. Significant interactions between PiB positivity and higher SVD burden were found to affect cognitive decline in semantic word fluency (from WMH burden) and global dementia rating (from microbleed burden). CONCLUSIONS: In SVaD patients, amyloid burden, independently or interactively with SVD, contributed to longitudinal cognitive decline. Amyloid deposition was the strongest poor prognostic factor.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Liver cirrhosis is associated with functional abnormalities of the cardiovascular system with co-existing electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to analyze ECG changes in patients with cirrhosis, to evaluate whether alcoholic etiology of cirrhosis and ascites has an impact on ECG changes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study involved 81 patients with previously untreated alcoholic cirrhosis (64 patients with ascites, classes B and C according to the Child-Pugh classification; and 17 without ascites, categorized as class A); 41 patients with previously untreated cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C (HCV--30 patients with ascites, classes B and C; and 11 without ascites, class A); 42 with alcoholic steatohepatitis and 46 with alcoholic steatosis. The control group consisted of 32 healthy volunteers. Twelve-lead ECG recordings were performed and selected parameters were measured. RESULTS: Significantly longer QT and QTc intervals and lower QRS voltage were found in patients with alcoholic and HCV cirrhosis compared to the controls. Significantly lower QRS voltage was found in subjects with ascites than in those without ascites. Removal of ascites significantly increased QRS voltage. CONCLUSIONS: In cirrhosis, irrespective of etiology, ECG changes involved prolonged QT and QTc intervals and reduced QRS voltage. Prolonged QT and QTc intervals were not related to the severity of cirrhosis or to the presence of ascites. However, low QRS voltage was associated with the presence of ascites. Removal of ascites reverses low QRS voltage.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein and the formation of toxic aggregates are the possible pathogenic pathways in Alzheimer's disease. Accumulating evidence suggests that lipid membranes play key roles in protein aggregation, although the intermolecular forces that drive the interactions between Abeta-(1-40) and the membranes vary in different membrane systems. Here, we observed that a high positive curvature of lipid vesicles with diameters of ~30 nm enhanced the association of Abeta with anionic phosphatidylglycerol membranes in the liquid-crystalline phase and with zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine membranes in the gel phase. The binding modes of Abeta to these membranes differ in terms of the location of the protein on the membrane and of the protein secondary structure. The fibrillation of Abeta was accelerated in the presence of the vesicles and at high protein-to-lipid ratios. Under these conditions, the protein accumulated on the surfaces, as demonstrated by a high (10(7) M(-1)) binding constant. Our findings suggest that packing defects on membranes with high curvatures, such as the intraluminal vesicles in multivesicular bodies and the exosomes, might result in the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates.",

    "abstract": "Cholinesterase inhibitors are first-line therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). DL0410 is an AChE/BuChE dual inhibitor with a novel new structural scaffold. It has been demonstrated that DL0410 could improve memory deficits in both Abeta1-42-induced and scopolamine-induced amnesia in mice. In the present study, the therapeutic effect of DL0410 and its action mechanism were investigated in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Six-month old APP/PS1 transgenic mice were orally administered with DL0410 (3, 10, 30 mg/kg/day). After 60 days, several behavioural tests, including the Morris water maze and step-down tests, were used to investigate the effects of DL0410 on mice behaviours. All the behavioural experimental results showed that DL0410 significantly ameliorated memory deficits. Meanwhile, DL0410 attenuated neural cell damage and reduced senile plaques significantly in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. In addition, DL0410 significantly decreased Abeta plaques, while increasing the number of synapses and the thickness of PSD in the hippocampus. We also found DL0410 decreased the expression of APP, NMDAR1B and the phosphorylation level of NMDAR2B, and increased the phosphorylation level of CAMKII and the expression of PSD-95. In this study, the results of behavioural tests demonstrated for the first time that DL0410 could improve learning and memory dysfunction in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The mechanism of its beneficial effects might be related to cholinesterase inhibition, Abeta plaques inhibition, improvement of synapse loss by regulating of expression of proteins related to synapses. As a result, DL0410 could be considered as a candidate drug for the therapy of AD.",

    "abstract": "beta-Amyloid peptide (Abeta) was used to induce apoptosis in PC12 cells differentiated by nerve growth factor, and the protective activities of maslinic acid (MA) at 2-16 muM were examined. Abeta treatment lowered Bcl-2 expression, raised Bax expression, and decreased cell viability. MA pretreatments decreased Bax expression, raised the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and increased cell viability. MA pretreatments retained glutathione content and decreased subsequent Abeta-induced release of reactive oxygen species, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6. Abeta treatment up-regulated protein expression of p47(phox), gp91(phox), mitogen-activated protein kinase, advanced glycation end product receptor (RAGE), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB). MA pretreatments at 2-16 muM suppressed the expression of proteins including gp91(phox), p47(phox), p-p38, and NF-kappaB p65, at 4-16 muM down-regulated RAGE and NF-kappaB p50 expression, and at 8 and 16 muM reduced p-ERK1/2 expression. These novel findings suggest that maslinic acid is a potent compound against Abeta-induced cytotoxicity.",

    "title": "Qualitative changes in human gamma-secretase underlie familial Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Presenilin (PSEN) pathogenic mutations cause familial Alzheimer's disease (AD [FAD]) in an autosomal-dominant manner. The extent to which the healthy and diseased alleles influence each other to cause neurodegeneration remains unclear. In this study, we assessed gamma-secretase activity in brain samples from 15 nondemented subjects, 22 FAD patients harboring nine different mutations in PSEN1, and 11 sporadic AD (SAD) patients. FAD and control brain samples had similar overall gamma-secretase activity levels, and therefore, loss of overall (endopeptidase) gamma-secretase function cannot be an essential part of the pathogenic mechanism. In contrast, impaired carboxypeptidase-like activity (gamma-secretase dysfunction) is a constant feature in all FAD brains. Significantly, we demonstrate that pharmacological activation of the carboxypeptidase-like gamma-secretase activity with gamma-secretase modulators alleviates the mutant PSEN pathogenic effects. Most SAD cases display normal endo- and carboxypeptidase-like gamma-secretase activities. However and interestingly, a few SAD patient samples display gamma-secretase dysfunction, suggesting that gamma-secretase may play a role in some SAD cases. In conclusion, our study highlights qualitative shifts in amyloid-beta (Abeta) profiles as the common denominator in FAD and supports a model in which the healthy allele contributes with normal Abeta products and the diseased allele generates longer aggregation-prone peptides that act as seeds inducing toxic amyloid conformations.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that recurrent Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection spreading to the CNS is a risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated yet. Here we demonstrate that in cultured mouse cortical neurons HSV-1 induced Ca(2+)-dependent activation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3. This event was critical for the HSV-1-dependent phosphorylation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) at Thr668 and the following intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta). HSV-1-infected neurons also exhibited: i) significantly reduced expression of the presynaptic proteins synapsin-1 and synaptophysin; ii) depressed synaptic transmission. These effects depended on GSK-3 activation and intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta. In fact, either the selective GSK-3 inhibitor, SB216763, or a specific antibody recognizing Abeta (4G8) significantly counteracted the effects induced by HSV-1 at the synaptic level. Moreover, in neurons derived from APP KO mice and infected with HSV-1 Abeta accumulation was not found and synaptic protein expression was only slightly reduced when compared to wild-type infected neurons. These data further support our contention that HSV-1 infections spreading to the CNS may contribute to AD phenotype.",

Here, we synthesize a single deletion mutant, DeltaG25, with the aim of sterically hindering the hairpin turn in Abeta18-35. We find that the solubility of the peptide goes up by more than 20-fold. Although some oligomeric structures do form, solution state NMR spectroscopy shows that they have mostly random coil conformations. Fibrils ultimately form at a much higher concentration but have widths approximately twice that of Abeta18-35, suggesting an opening of the hairpin bend. Surprisingly, two-dimensional solid state NMR shows that the contact between Phe(19) and Leu(34) residues, observed in full-length Abeta and Abeta18-35, is still intact in these fibrils. This is possible if the monomers in the fibril are arranged in an antiparallel beta-sheet conformation. Indeed, IR measurements, supported by tyrosine cross-linking experiments, provide a characteristic signature of the antiparallel beta-sheet. We conclude that the self-assembly of Abeta is critically dependent on the hairpin turn and on the contact between the Phe(19) and Leu(34) regions, making them potentially sensitive targets for Alzheimer's therapeutics. Our results show the importance of specific conformations in an aggregation process thought to be primarily driven by nonspecific hydrophobic interactions.",

    "abstract": "We present an integrated microfluidic chip for detection of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides. Abeta peptides are major biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its early stages. This microfluidic device consists of three main parts: (1) An immunocapture microcolumn based on self-assembled magnetic beads coated with antibodies specific to Abeta peptides, (2) a nano-porous membrane made of photopolymerized hydrogel for preconcentration, and (3) a microchip electrophoresis (MCE) channel with fluorescent detection. Sub-milliliter sample volume is either mixed off-chip with antibody coated magnetic beads and injected into the device or is injected into an already self-assembled column of magnetic beads in the microchannel. The captured peptides on the beads are then electrokinetically eluted and re-concentrated onto the nano-membrane in a few nano-liters. By integrating the nano-membrane, total assay time was reduced and also off-chip re-concentration or buffer exchange steps were not needed. Finally, the concentrated peptides in the chip are separated by electrophoresis in a polymer-based matrix. The device was applied to the capture and MCE analysis of differently truncated peptides Abeta (1-37, 1-39, 1-40, and 1-42) and was able to detect as low as 25 ng of synthetic Abeta peptides spiked in undiluted cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The device was also tested with CSF samples from healthy donors. CSF samples were fluorescently labelled and pre-mixed with the magnetic beads and injected into the device. The results indicated that Abeta1-40, an important biomarker for distinguishing patients with frontotemporal lobe dementia from controls and AD patients, was detectable. Although the sensitivity of this device is not yet enough to detect all Abeta subtypes in CSF, this is the first report on an integrated or semi-integrated device for capturing and analyzing of differently truncated Abeta peptides. The method is less demanding and faster than the conventional Western blotting method currently used for research.",

    "abstract": "Specific glycosylated peptides of clusterin are found associated with hippocampal atrophy. The glycosylation of clusterin from human plasma was comprehensively analyzed and characterized using mass spectrometry (MS)-based glycoproteomics analysis. All six known N-glycosylation sites are covered, three in the alpha subunit (alpha64N, alpha81N and alpha123N) and three in the beta subunit (beta64N, beta127N, and beta147N). More detailed structural characterization of clusterin glycopeptides was also performed, demonstrating the presence of glycosylated peptides and their corresponding glycans. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we have determined the differences in the glycoforms associated at each of the different glycosylation sites in plasma clusterin obtained from subjects of low hippocampal atrophy (n = 13) and high hippocampal atrophy (n = 14). In our pilot study, the beta64N site shows the most significant regulations between clinical groups. Eight beta64N glycoforms are significantly reduced in patients with high atrophy compared with those with low atrophy, which demonstrates the utility of clusterin isoforms as diagnostic and prognostic Alzheimer's disease (AD) markers. These results provide a novel and robust workflow suitable for rapid verification of specific clusterin glycoforms with utility as AD biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Oligomers formed by the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) are pathogens in Alzheimer's disease. Increased knowledge on the oligomerization process is crucial for understanding the disease and for finding treatments. Ideally, Abeta oligomerization should be studied in solution and at physiologically relevant concentrations, but most popular techniques of today are not capable of such analyses. We demonstrate here that the combination of Forster Resonance Energy Transfer and Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FRET-FCS) has a unique ability to detect small subpopulations of FRET-active molecules and oligomers. FRET-FCS could readily detect a FRET-active oligonucleotide present at levels as low as 0.5% compared to FRET-inactive dye molecules. In contrast, three established fluorescence fluctuation techniques (FCS, FCCS, and PCH) required fractions between 7 and 11%. When applied to the analysis of Abeta, FRET-FCS detected oligomers consisting of less than 10 Abeta molecules, which coexisted with the monomers at fractions as low as 2 +- 2%. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time direct detection of small fractions of Abeta oligomers in solution at physiological concentrations. This ability of FRET-FCS could be an indispensable tool for studying biological oligomerization processes, in general, and for finding therapeutically useful oligomerization inhibitors.",

However, studies on derivation of BFCNs from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are limited, and the application of ESC-derived BFCNs remains to be determined. Here, we report on differentiation approaches for directing both mouse and human ESCs into mature BFCNs. These ESC-derived BFCNs exhibit features similar to those of their in vivo counterparts and acquire appropriate functional properties. After transplantation into the basal forebrain of AD model mice, ESC-derived BFCN progenitors predominantly differentiate into mature cholinergic neurons that functionally integrate into the endogenous basal forebrain cholinergic projection system. The AD mice grafted with mouse or human BFCNs exhibit improvements in learning and memory performances. Our findings suggest a promising perspective of ESC-derived BFCNs in the development of stem cell-based therapies for treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is essential for maintaining brain homeostasis and protecting neural tissue from damaging blood-borne agents. The barrier is characterized by endothelial tight junctions that limit passive paracellular diffusion of polar solutes and macromolecules from blood to brain. Decreased brain clearance of the neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is a central event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whereas transport of Abeta across the BBB can occur via transcellular endothelial receptors, the paracellular movement of Abeta has not been described. We show that soluble human Abeta(1-40) monomers can diffuse across the paracellular pathway of the BBB in tandem with a decrease in the tight junction proteins claudin-5 and occludin in the cerebral vascular endothelium. In a murine model of AD (Tg2576), plasma Abeta(1-40) levels were significantly increased, brain Abeta(1-40) levels were decreased, and cognitive function was enhanced when both claudin-5 and occludin were suppressed. Furthermore, Abeta can cause a transient down-regulation of claudin-5 and occludin, allowing for its own paracellular clearance across the BBB. Our results show, for the first time, the involvement of the paracellular pathway in autoregulated Abeta movement across the BBB and identify both claudin-5 and occludin as potential therapeutic targets for AD. These findings also indicate that controlled modulation of tight junction components at the BBB can enhance the clearance of Abeta from the brain.",

Mouse Neuro-2a cells expressing human APP695 were incubated with folic acid (2.8-40 mumol/L), and with or without zebularine (the DNMT inhibitor). DNMT activity, cell viability, Abeta and DNMTs expression were then examined. The results showed that folic acid stimulated DNMT gene and protein expression, and DNMT activity. Furthermore, folic acid decreased Abeta protein production, whereas inhibition of DNMT activity by zebularine increased Abeta production.

    "title": "Passive immunotherapy targeting amyloid-beta reduces cerebral amyloid angiopathy and improves vascular reactivity.",
    "abstract": "Prominent cerebral amyloid angiopathy is often observed in the brains of elderly individuals and is almost universally found in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is characterized by accumulation of the shorter amyloid-beta isoform(s) (predominantly amyloid-beta40) in the walls of leptomeningeal and cortical arterioles and is likely a contributory factor to vascular dysfunction leading to stroke and dementia in the elderly. We used transgenic mice with prominent cerebral amyloid angiopathy to investigate the ability of ponezumab, an anti-amyloid-beta40 selective antibody, to attenuate amyloid-beta accrual in cerebral vessels and to acutely restore vascular reactivity. Chronic administration of ponezumab to transgenic mice led to a significant reduction in amyloid and amyloid-beta accumulation both in leptomeningeal and brain vessels when measured by intravital multiphoton imaging and immunohistochemistry. By enriching for cerebral vascular elements, we also measured a significant reduction in the levels of soluble amyloid-beta biochemically. We hypothesized that the reduction in vascular amyloid-beta40 after ponezumab administration may reflect the ability of ponezumab to mobilize an interstitial fluid pool of amyloid-beta40 in brain. Acutely, ponezumab triggered a significant and transient increase in interstitial fluid amyloid-beta40 levels in old plaque-bearing transgenic mice but not in young animals. We also measured a beneficial effect on vascular reactivity following acute administration of ponezumab, even in vessels where there was a severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy burden. Taken together, the beneficial effects ponezumab administration has on reducing the rate of cerebral amyloid angiopathy deposition and restoring cerebral vascular health favours a mechanism that involves rapid removal and/or neutralization of amyloid-beta species that may otherwise be detrimental to normal vessel function.",

Here we compared active versus passive brain uptake of systemically dosed antibodies (anti-transferrin receptor [TfR] bispecific versus control antibody) in mouse models of AD. We first confirmed BBB disruption in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis as a positive control. Importantly, we found that BBB permeability was vastly spared in mouse models of AD, including PS2-APP, Tau transgenics, and APOE4 knockin mice. Brain levels of TfR in mouse models or in human cases of AD resembled controls, suggesting target engagement of TfR bispecific is not limited. Furthermore, infarcts from human AD brain showed similar occurrences compared to age-matched controls. These results question the widely held view that the BBB is largely disrupted in AD, raising concern about assumptions of drug permeability in disease.",

Grid-cell-like representations in humans can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that young adults at genetic risk for AD (APOE-epsilon4 carriers) exhibit reduced grid-cell-like representations and altered navigational behavior in a virtual arena. Both changes were associated with impaired spatial memory performance. Reduced grid-cell-like representations were also related to increased hippocampal activity, potentially reflecting compensatory mechanisms that prevent overt spatial memory impairment in APOE-epsilon4 carriers.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder in which amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide accumulates in the brain. The receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) is a cellular binding site for Abeta peptide and mediates amyloid beta-induced perturbations in cerebral vessels, neurons, and microglia in AD. Here, we identified a specific high-affinity RAGE inhibitor (APDTKTQ named RP-1) from a phage display library. RP-1 bound to RAGE and inhibited Abeta peptide-induced cellular stress in human neuroblastoma SH-SYSY cells in vitro. Three amino acids in RP-1 are identical to those in the Abeta peptide. RP-1 shows high homology to the 16-23 (KLVFFAED) regions in Abeta peptide and high-affinity RAGE. Functional analyses indicated that RP-1 significantly reduced the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS products and that it enhanced catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. Furthermore, it inactivated caspase3 and caspase9 and inhibited the upregulation of RAGE, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) protein expression. In addition, RP-1 activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, inhibiting the interaction between Bax and Bcl-2. Our data suggest that RP-1 is a potent RAGE blocker that effectively controls the progression of Abeta peptide-mediated brain disorders and that it may have potential as a disease-modifying agent for AD.",

However, growing evidence suggests that a linear disease model based on beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) alone is not likely to be realistic, which therefore calls for further investigations on the other actors involved in the play. The pro-oxidant environment induced by Abeta in AD pathology is well established, and a correlation among Abeta, oxidative stress, and conformational changes in p53 has been suggested. In this study, we applied a multifunctional approach to identify allyl thioesters of variously substituted trans-cinnamic acids for which the pharmacological profile was strategically tuned by hydroxy substituents on the aromatic moiety. Indeed, only catechol derivative 3 [(S)-allyl (E)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)prop-2-enethioate] inhibited Abeta fibrilization. Conversely, albeit to different extents, all compounds were able to decrease the formation of reactive oxygen species in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and to prevent alterations in the conformation of p53 and its activity mediated by soluble sub-lethal concentrations of Abeta. This may support an involvement of oxidative stress in Abeta function, with p53 emerging as a potential mediator of their functional interplay.",

Central infusion of Abeta42 can lead to memory impairment in mice. Inhibiting the aggregation of Abeta has been considered a therapeutic strategy for AD. Endomorphin-1 (EM-1), an endogenous agonist of mu-opioid receptors, has been shown to inhibit the aggregation of Abeta in vitro. In the present study, we investigated whether EM-1 could alleviate the memory-impairing effects of Abeta42 in mice using novel object recognition (NOR) and object location recognition (OLR) tasks. We showed that co-administration of EM-1 was able to ameliorate Abeta42-induced amnesia in the lateral ventricle and the hippocampus, and these effects could not be inhibited by naloxone, an antagonist of mu-opioid receptors. Infusion of EM-1 or naloxone separately into the lateral ventricle had no influence on memory in the tasks.

    "abstract": "Iron chelation therapy and inhibition of glial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase can both represent possible routes for Alzheimer's disease modifying therapies. The metal hypothesis is largely focused on direct binding of metals to the N-terminal hydrophilic 1-16 domain peptides of Amyloid beta (Abeta) and how they jointly give rise to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The cytotoxic effects of Abeta through ROS and metals are mainly studied in neuronal cells using full-length Abeta1-40/42 peptides. Here we study cellularly-derived ROS during 2-60min in response to non-metal associated mid domain Abeta25-35 in microglial Bv2 cells by fluorescence based spectroscopy. We analyze if Abeta25-35 induce ROS production through NADPH oxidase and if the production is sensitive to iron chelation. NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyliodonium (DPI) is used to confirm the production of ROS through NADPH oxidase. We modulate cellular iron homeostasis by applying cell permeable iron chelators desferrioxamine (DFO) and deferiprone (DFP). NADPH oxidase subunit gp91-phox level was analyzed by Western blotting. Our results show that Abeta25-35 induces strong ROS production through NADPH oxidase in Bv2 microglial cells. Intracellular iron depletion resulted in restrained Abeta25-35 induced ROS.",

    "title": "Melanopsin retinal ganglion cell loss in Alzheimer disease.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) are photoreceptors driving circadian photoentrainment, and circadian dysfunction characterizes Alzheimer disease (AD). We investigated mRGCs in AD, hypothesizing that they contribute to circadian dysfunction. METHODS: We assessed retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in 21 mild-moderate AD patients, and in a subgroup of 16 we evaluated rest-activity circadian rhythm by actigraphy. We studied postmortem mRGCs by immunohistochemistry in retinas, and axons in optic nerve cross-sections of 14 neuropathologically confirmed AD patients. We coimmunostained for retinal amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition and melanopsin to locate mRGCs. All AD cohorts were compared with age-matched controls. RESULTS: We demonstrated an age-related optic neuropathy in AD by OCT, with a significant reduction of RNFL thickness (p = 0.038), more evident in the superior quadrant (p = 0.006). Axonal loss was confirmed in postmortem AD optic nerves. Abnormal circadian function characterized only a subgroup of AD patients. Sleep efficiency was significantly reduced in AD patients (p = 0.001). We also found a significant loss of mRGCs in postmortem AD retinal specimens (p = 0.003) across all ages and abnormal mRGC dendritic morphology and size (p = 0.003). In flat-mounted AD retinas, Abeta accumulation was remarkably evident inside and around mRGCs. INTERPRETATION: We show variable degrees of rest-activity circadian dysfunction in AD patients. We also demonstrate age-related loss of optic nerve axons and specifically mRGC loss and pathology in postmortem AD retinal specimens, associated with Abeta deposition. These results all support the concept that mRGC degeneration is a contributor to circadian rhythm dysfunction in AD.",

    "title": "Dimeric bis (heptyl)-Cognitin Blocks Alzheimer's beta-Amyloid Neurotoxicity Via the Inhibition of Abeta Fibrils Formation and Disaggregation of Preformed Fibrils.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: Fibrillar aggregates of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) are the main constituent of senile plaques and considered to be one of the causative events in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compounds that could inhibit Abeta fibrils formation, disaggregate preformed Abeta fibrils as well as reduce their associated neurotoxicity might have therapeutic values for treating AD. In this study, the inhibitory effects of bis (heptyl)-cognitin (B7C), a multifunctional dimer derived from tacrine, on aggregation and neurotoxicity of Abeta1-40 were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Thioflavin T fluorescence assay was carried out to evaluate Abeta aggregation, MTT and Hoechst-staining assays were performed to investigate Abeta-associated neurotoxicity. Fluorescent probe DCFH-DA was used to estimate the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen stress (ROS). Morris water maze was applied to determine learning and memory deficits induced by intracerebroventricular infusion of Abeta in rats. RESULTS: B7C (0.1-10 muM), but not tacrine, effectively inhibited Abeta fibrils formation and disaggregated preformed Abeta fibrils following co-incubation of B7C and Abeta monomers or preformed fibrils, respectively. In addition, B7C markedly reduced Abeta fibrils-associated neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cell line, as evidenced by the increase in cell survival, the decrease in Hoechst-stained nuclei and in intracellular ROS. Most encouragingly, B7C (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg), 10 times more potently than tacrine (1 and 2 mg/kg), inhibited memory impairments after intracerebroventricular infusion of Abeta in rats, as evidenced by the decrease in escape latency and the increase in the spatial bias in Morris water maze test along with upregulation of choline acetyltransferase activity and downregulation of acetylcholinesterase activity. CONCLUSION: These findings provide not only novel molecular insight into the potential application of B7C in treating AD, but also an effective approach for screening anti-AD agents.",

    "title": "PPARgamma agonists regulate bidirectional transport of amyloid-beta across the blood-brain barrier and hippocampus plasticity in db/db mice.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is emerging evidence suggesting that abnormal transport of amyloid-beta (Abeta) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is involved in diabetes-associated cognitive decline. We investigated whether PPARgamma agonists restore Abeta transport across the BBB and hippocampal plasticity in db/db mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Efflux and influx of Abeta across the BBB were determined by stereotaxic intra-cerebral or i.a. infusion of [(125) I]-Abeta1-40 respectively. Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), which are involved in Abeta influx and efflux, PPARgamma and NF-kappaB p65 at the BBB, as well as hippocampal Abeta, caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 were assayed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. In vivo, hippocampal LTP was recorded, and Morris water maze and Y-maze tasks were performed. KEY RESULTS: Treatment with PPARgamma agonists, rosiglitazone (0.8 mg kg(-1) ) and pioglitazone (9.0 mg kg(-1) ), for 6 weeks significantly increased Abeta efflux and decreased Abeta influx across the BBB in db/db mice. Concomitantly, they decreased hippocampal Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 , suppressed neuronal apoptosis, as indicated by decreased caspase-3 activity and increased ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and increased hippocampal plasticity, characterized by an enhanced in vivo LTP and better performance in behavioural tests. Furthermore, the PPARgamma agonists induced the expression of LRP1 gene by activation of PPARgamma and suppressed RAGE gene expression by inactivation of NF-kappaB signalling at the BBB of db/db mice. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: PPARgamma agonists modify abnormal Abeta transport across the BBB and this is accompanied by amelioration of beta-amyloidosis and an improvement in hippocampal plasticity in diabetic mice.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (encoded by ABCA1) regulates cholesterol efflux from cells to apolipoproteins A-I and E (ApoA-I and APOE; encoded by APOA1 and APOE, respectively) and the generation of high density lipoproteins. In Abca1 knockout mice (Abca1(ko)), high density lipoproteins and ApoA-I are virtually lacking, and total APOE and APOE-containing lipoproteins in brain substantially decreased. As the epsilon4 allele of APOE is the major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, ABCA1 role as a modifier of APOE lipidation is of significance for this disease. Reportedly, Abca1 deficiency in mice expressing human APP accelerates amyloid deposition and behaviour deficits. We used APP/PS1dE9 mice crossed to Apoe and Apoa1 knockout mice to generate Apoe/Apoa1 double-knockout mice. We hypothesized that Apoe/Apoa1 double-knockout mice would mimic the phenotype of APP/Abca1(ko) mice in regards to amyloid plaques and cognitive deficits. Amyloid pathology, peripheral lipoprotein metabolism, cognitive deficits and dendritic morphology of Apoe/Apoa1 double-knockout mice were compared to APP/Abca1(ko), APP/PS1dE9, and single Apoa1 and Apoe knockouts. Contrary to our prediction, the results demonstrate that double deletion of Apoe and Apoa1 ameliorated the amyloid pathology, including amyloid plaques and soluble amyloid. In double knockout mice we show that (125)I-amyloid-beta microinjected into the central nervous system cleared at a rate twice faster compared to Abca1 knockout mice. We tested the effect of Apoe, Apoa1 or Abca1 deficiency on spreading of exogenous amyloid-beta seeds injected into the brain of young pre-depositing APP mice. The results show that lack of Abca1 augments dissemination of exogenous amyloid significantly more than the lack of Apoe. In the periphery, Apoe/Apoa1 double-knockout mice exhibited substantial atherosclerosis and very high levels of low density lipoproteins compared to APP/PS1dE9 and APP/Abca1(ko). Plasma level of amyloid-beta42 measured at several time points for each mouse was significantly higher in Apoe/Apoa1 double-knockout then in APP/Abca1(ko) mice. This result demonstrates that mice with the lowest level of plasma lipoproteins, APP/Abca1(ko), have the lowest level of peripheral amyloid-beta. Unexpectedly, and independent of amyloid pathology, the deletion of both apolipoproteins worsened behaviour deficits of double knockout mice and their performance was undistinguishable from those of Abca1 knockout mice. Finally we observed that the dendritic complexity in the CA1 region of hippocampus but not in CA2 is significantly impaired by Apoe/Apoa1 double deletion as well as by lack of ABCA1. IN CONCLUSION: (i) plasma lipoproteins may affect amyloid-beta clearance from the brain by the 'peripheral sink' mechanism; and (ii) deficiency of brain APOE-containing lipoproteins is of significance for dendritic complexity and cognition.",

    "title": "Amyloid-beta suppresses AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and contributes to alpha-synuclein-induced cytotoxicity.",
    "abstract": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by abnormal accumulation of Lewy bodies, which are intracellular deposits composed primarily of aggregated alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn). Although alphaSyn has been strongly implicated to induce neurotoxicity, overexpression of wild-type alphaSyn is shown to be insufficient to trigger formation of protein aggregates by itself. Therefore, investigating the possible mechanism underlying alphaSyn aggregation is essential to understand the pathogenesis of DLB. Previous studies have demonstrated that amyloid beta (Abeta), the primary cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD), may promote the formation of alphaSyn inclusion bodies. However, it remains unclear how Abeta contributes to the deposition and neurotoxicity of alphaSyn. In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of Abeta in alphaSyn-overexpressed neuronal cells. Our results showed that Abeta inhibits autophagy and enhances alphaSyn aggregation in alphaSyn-overexpressed cells. Moreover, Abeta also reduced sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and its downstream signaling, resulting in increased intracellular ROS accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our in vitro and in vivo studies support that Abeta-inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling is involved in the neurotoxic effects of alphaSyn. Taken together, our findings suggest that Abeta plays a synergistic role in alphaSyn aggregation and cytotoxicity, which may provide a novel understanding for exploring the underlying molecular mechanism of DLB.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and microglia, the brain's resident phagocyte, are pivotal for the immune response observed in AD. Microglia act as sentinel and protective cells, but may become inappropriately reactive in AD to drive neuropathology. Recent Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified more than 20 gene variants associated with an increased risk of late-onset AD (LOAD), the most prevalent form of AD [1]. The findings strongly implicate genes related to the immune response (CR1, CD33, MS4A, CLU, ABCA7, EPHA1 and HLA-DRB5-HLA-DRB1), endocytosis (BIN1, PICALM, CD2AP, EPHA1 and SORL1) and lipid biology (CLU, ABCA7 and SORL1) [2-8], and many encode proteins which are highly expressed in microglia [1]. Furthermore, recent identification of a low frequency mutation in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 protein (TREM2) confers increased risk of AD in LOAD cohorts with an effect size similar to that for APOE, until recently the only identified genetic risk factor associated with LOAD [9,10(  )] (Figure 1). The present review summarises our current understanding of the probable roles of microglial genes in the regulation of neuroinflammatory processes in AD and their relation to other processes affecting the disease's progression.",

These deleterious events largely result from disruption of cerebral hemostasis, a well-controlled and delicate balance between thrombotic and fibrinolytic pathways in cerebral blood vessels and surrounding brain tissue. Ischemia and hemorrhage are both commonly associated with cerebrovascular deposition of amyloid ss-protein (Ass). In this regard, Ass directly and indirectly modulates cerebral thrombosis and fibrinolysis. Further, major isoforms of the Ass precursor protein (AssPP) function as a potent inhibitor of pro-thrombotic proteinases. The purpose of this review article is to summarize recent research on how cerebral vascular Ass and AssPP influence cerebral hemostasis.

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a type of neurodegenerative disease characterized by learning and memory impairment, is often associated with pathological features, such as amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation and insulin resistance. The transgenic mouse, APPswePS1dE9 (APP/PS1), is one of the most commonly used animal models in pathogenesis studies of AD. The purpose of this study is to investigate the sex differences between APP/PS1 mice in the pathogenesis of AD. The impairment of glucose and insulin tolerance was found to develop earlier in male APP/PS1 mice than in females. Plasma insulin levels were significantly decreased in male APP/PS1 mice, while total cholesterol levels in male APP/PS1 mice were higher than those in females. Triglyceride levels in male mice in both the wild-type (WT) and APP/PS1 groups were higher than in their female littermates. Soluble and insoluble Abeta levels in female APP/PS1 mouse brains were higher than those in males. And the learning and memorizing abilities of female APP/PS1 mice were poorer than those of males. Our results concluded that there were sex differences in Abeta formation, pancreatic islet function and insulin sensitivity between male and female APP/PS1 mice during the pathogenesis of AD.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of chronic galantamine treatment on cognitive performance, Abeta deposition and astrocyte activation in the transgenic APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. Galantamine (5mg/kg, i.p.) or 0.9% saline was administrated twice daily for eight weeks in 10-month-old APP/PS1 mice. In addition a separate group of 10-month old male C57BL/6 wild type mice was included as a reference control. Compared with saline treated APP/PS1 mice, galantamine treated mice exhibited significantly improved escape latencies on Days 6 and 7 of testing (p<0.05) and significantly decreased numbers of platform crossings (p<0.01) as assessed in the Morris water maze. Galantamine reduced the total area of amyloid load within the hippocampus of transgenic APP/PS1 mice, inhibited astrocyte activation as assessed by immunohistochemistry and decreased intracellular TNF-alpha and IL-6 expression as determined by immunofluorescence. Galantamine failed to alter hippocampal levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 as assayed by ELISA. Galantamine may be involved in modifying AD pathophysiological mechanisms by alleviating Abeta deposition and neuroinflammation. The results from this study provide new evidence for use of galantamine in the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) accounts for 1%-2% of all Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects, with large variation in the reported genetic contribution of known dementia genes. In this pilot study, we genetically characterized a German EOAD cohort (23 subjects) by whole-exome sequencing, capturing variants in all recognized AD and frontotemporal dementia genes. After variant filtering, we identified 7 events of altogether 6 different rare variants in 6 subjects, including 4 novel variants. Four of the 6 variants, observed in 5 different index subjects (5/23 = 22%), were considered to be possibly pathogenic. These included 2 presenilin 2 (PSEN2) variants (p.N141I-previously denoted as a Volga German variant, observed in 2 index subjects; and p.L238P), 1 amyloid precursor protein (p.I716M), and 1 presenilin 1 (DeltaE9). Using a control exome data set of 96 ethnically matched neurodegenerative disease controls (Parkinson's disease), we identified only 1 variant (PSEN2 p.T18M) (1%), demonstrating a significantly higher mutational burden in the EOAD group (p > 0.0001). Our findings demonstrate a substantial frequency of variants in dementia genes in EOAD, including several seemingly \"sporadic\" subjects. This indicates that heritability in EOAD might be higher than assumed. The finding of 3 subjects carrying potential pathogenic PSEN2 variants suggests that, in specific populations PSEN2 variants might be as frequent as (or more frequent than) presenilin 1, for example, in German populations which are influenced by Volga German heritage. Variants in AD genes were also associated with rare phenotypes such as frontal AD or primary progressive aphasia, demonstrating the need to screen AD genes in frontotemporal dementia-like phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Epileptic activity may be more prevalent in early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) than previously believed. Several studies report spontaneous seizures and interictal discharges in mouse models of AD undergoing age-related Abeta accumulation. The mechanism by which Abeta-induced neuronal excitability can trigger epileptiform activity remains unknown. Here, we systematically examined field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) in stratum radiatum and population spikes (PSs) in the adjacent stratum pyramidale of CA1 in wild-type mouse hippocampal slices. Soluble Abeta oligomers (oAbeta) blocked hippocampal LTP and EPSP-spike (E-S) potentiation, and these effects were occluded by prior treatment with the glutamate uptake inhibitor TBOA. In accord, oAbeta elevated glutamate levels in the hippocampal slice medium. Recording the PS revealed that oAbeta increased PS frequency and reduced LTP, and this LTP deficit was occluded by pretreatment with the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin. Whole-cell recordings showed that oAbeta significantly increased spontaneous EPSC frequency. Decreasing neuronal activity by increasing GABA tone or partially blocking NMDAR activity prevented oAbeta impairment of hippocampal LTP. Finally, treating slices with two antiepileptic drugs rescued the LTP inhibition induced by oAbeta. We conclude that soluble Abeta oligomers at the low nanomolar levels present in AD brain increase neuronal excitability by disrupting glutamatergic/GABAergic balance, thereby impairing synaptic plasticity.",

    "title": "Cortical Lewy bodies and Abeta burden are associated with prevalence and timing of dementia in Lewy body diseases.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: Our main objective was to determine the neuropathological correlates of dementia in patients with Lewy body disease (LBD). Furthermore, we used data derived from clinical, neuropathological and genetic studies to investigate boundary issues between Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with (PDD) and without (PDND) dementia. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-one cases with a neuropathological diagnosis of LBD and clinical information on dementia status were included in the analysis (55 PDD, 17 DLB and 49 PDND). We carried out topographical and semi-quantitative assessment of Lewy bodies (LB), Abeta plaques and tau-positive neuropil threads (NT). The APOE genotype and MAPT haplotype status were also determined. RESULTS: The cortical LB (CLB) burden was the only independent predictor of dementia (OR: 4.12, P < 0.001). The total cortical Abeta plaque burden was an independent predictor of a shorter latency to dementia from onset of motor signs (P = 0.001). DLB cases had a higher LB burden in the parietal and temporal cortex, compared to PDD. Carrying at least one APOE epsilon4 allele was associated with a higher cortical LB burden (P = 0.02), particularly in the neocortical frontal, parietal and temporal regions. CONCLUSIONS: High CLB burden is a key neuropathological substrate of dementia in LBD. Elevated cortical LB pathology and Abeta plaque deposition are both correlated with a faster progression to dementia. The higher CLB load in the temporal and parietal regions, which seems to be a distinguishing feature of DLB, may account for the shorter latency to dementia and could be mediated by the APOE epsilon4 allele.",

Remarkable conformational dependence of the amide-II spectral profile is obtained by ab initio computations as well as modeling analysis. Intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction and its influence on backbone structure and on the amide-II local-mode transition frequencies and intensities are examined. Through-space and through-bond contributions of the amide-II vibrational couplings are analyzed, and it was found that hydrogen-bonding interaction is not a determining factor for the coupling strength. The results reported here provide useful benchmarks for understanding experimental amide-II infrared spectra of beta-peptides and suggest the potential application of this mode on monitoring the structures and dynamics of beta-peptides.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) sequence length variants with varying aggregation propensity coexist in vivo, where coaggregation and cross-catalysis phenomena may affect the aggregation process. Until recently, naturally occurring amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) variants were believed to begin at or after the canonical beta-secretase cleavage site within the amyloid beta-protein precursor. However, N-terminally extended forms of Abeta (NTE-Abeta) were recently discovered and may contribute to Alzheimer's disease. Here, we have used thioflavin T fluorescence to study the aggregation kinetics of Abeta42 variants with N-terminal extensions of 5-40 residues, and transmission electron microscopy to analyze the end states. We find that all variants form amyloid fibrils of similar morphology as Abeta42, but the half-time of aggregation (t1/2) increases exponentially with extension length. Monte Carlo simulations of model peptides suggest that the retardation is due to an underlying general physicochemical effect involving reduced frequency of productive molecular encounters. Indeed, global kinetic analyses reveal that NTE-Abeta42s form fibrils via the same mechanism as Abeta42, but all microscopic rate constants (primary and secondary nucleation, elongation) are reduced for the N-terminally extended variants. Still, Abeta42 and NTE-Abeta42 coaggregate to form mixed fibrils and fibrils of either Abeta42 or NTE-Abeta42 catalyze aggregation of all monomers. NTE-Abeta42 monomers display reduced aggregation rate with all kinds of seeds implying that extended termini interfere with the ability of monomers to nucleate or elongate. Cross-seeding or coaggregation may therefore represent an important contribution in the in vivo formation of assemblies believed to be important in disease.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cortical beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition is associated with circadian blood pressure (BP) profiles and dynamic cerebral blood flow (CBF) regulation in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). METHODS: Forty participants with aMCI were included in this study. Cortical Abeta depositions were measured by (18)F-florbetapir PET and expressed as the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) relative to the cerebellum. Circadian BP profiles were measured by 24-hour ambulatory monitoring during awake and sleep periods. The dipping status of sleep BP (i.e., the percent changes from the awake BP) was calculated and dichotomized into the dipper (>=10%) and nondipper (<10%) groups. Dynamic CBF regulation was assessed by a transfer function analysis between beat-to-beat changes in BP and CBF velocity measured from the middle cerebral artery during a repeated sit-stand maneuver. RESULTS: Age was positively correlated with a greater Abeta deposition in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, and mean cortex. Accounting for the age effect, attenuated reductions in sleep systolic BP were associated with higher levels of posterior cingulate SUVR. Consistently, the nondippers exhibited a higher SUVR in the posterior cingulate than the dippers. Transfer function gain between changes in BP and CBF velocity was diminished in the nondippers, and moreover those individuals with a lower gain exhibited a higher SUVR in the posterior cingulate. CONCLUSIONS: Attenuated reductions in sleep BP are associated with a greater Abeta burden in the posterior cingulate and altered dynamic CBF regulation in patients with aMCI.",

    "title": "microRNA-33 Regulates ApoE Lipidation and Amyloid-beta Metabolism in the Brain.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Dysregulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) metabolism is critical for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Mounting evidence suggests that apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is involved in Abeta metabolism. ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a key regulator of ApoE lipidation, which affects Abeta levels. Therefore, identifying regulatory mechanisms of ABCA1 expression in the brain may provide new therapeutic targets for AD. Here, we demonstrate that microRNA-33 (miR-33) regulates ABCA1 and Abeta levels in the brain. Overexpression of miR-33 impaired cellular cholesterol efflux and dramatically increased extracellular Abeta levels by promoting Abeta secretion and impairing Abeta clearance in neural cells. In contrast, genetic deletion of mir-33 in mice dramatically increased ABCA1 levels and ApoE lipidation, but it decreased endogenous Abeta levels in cortex. Most importantly, pharmacological inhibition of miR-33 via antisense oligonucleotide specifically in the brain markedly decreased Abeta levels in cortex of APP/PS1 mice, representing a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Brain lipid metabolism, in particular Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) lipidation, is critical to Abeta metabolism and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain lipid metabolism is largely separated from the periphery due to blood-brain barrier and different repertoire of lipoproteins. Therefore, identifying the novel regulatory mechanism of brain lipid metabolism may provide a new therapeutic strategy for AD. Although there have been studies on brain lipid metabolism, its regulation, in particular by microRNAs, is relatively unknown. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of microRNA-33 increases lipidation of brain ApoE and reduces Abeta levels by inducing ABCA1. We provide a unique approach for AD therapeutics to increase ApoE lipidation and reduce Abeta levels via pharmacological inhibition of microRNA in vivo.",

    "abstract": "It is accepted that amyloid beta-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) have a prominent role in triggering the early cognitive deficits that constitute Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there is still no effective treatment for preventing or reversing the progression of the disease. Targeting alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor trafficking and its regulation is a new strategy for AD early treatment. Here we investigate the effect and mechanism of L-Stepholidine (L-SPD), which elicits dopamine D1-type receptor agonistic activity, while acting as D2-type receptor antagonist on cognition and synaptic plasticity in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) double-transgenic (APP/PS1) mice, and hippocampal cultures or slices treated with ADDLs. L-SPD could improve the hippocampus-dependent memory, surface expression of glutamate receptor A (GluA1)-containing AMPA receptors and spine density in hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. L-SPD not only rescued decreased phosphorylation and surface expression of GluA1 in hippocampal cultures but also protected the long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices induced by ADDLs. Protein kinase A (PKA) agonist Sp-cAMPS or D1-type receptor agonist SKF81297 had similar effects, whereas PKA antagonist Rp-cAMPS or D1-type receptor antagonist SCH23390 abolished the effect of L-SPD on GluA1 trafficking. This was mediated mainly by PKA, which could phosphorylate serine residue at 845 of the GluA1. L-SPD may be explored as a potential therapeutic drug for AD through a mechanism that improves AMPA receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity via activating D1/PKA signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Ferulic acid (FA) has been reported to exhibit protective effects against amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo. Recently, we developed two water-soluble FA derivatives: 1-feruloyl glycerol and 1-feruloyl diglycerol. In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effects of these water-soluble FA derivatives on Abeta-induced neurodegeneration both in vitro and in vivo. FA and water-soluble FA derivatives inhibited Abeta aggregation and destabilized pre-aggregated Abeta to a similar extent. Furthermore, water-soluble FA derivatives, as well as FA, inhibited Abeta-induced neuronal cell death in cultured neuronal cells. In in vivo experiments, oral administration of water-soluble FA derivatives to mice improved Abeta-induced dysmnesia assessed by contextual fear conditioning test and protected hippocampal neurons against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. This study provides useful evidence suggesting that water-soluble FA derivatives are expected to be effective neuroprotective agents.",

    "title": "The Voltage-dependent Anion Channel 1 Mediates Amyloid beta Toxicity and Represents a Potential Target for Alzheimer Disease Therapy.",
    "abstract": "The voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), found in the mitochondrial outer membrane, forms the main interface between mitochondrial and cellular metabolisms, mediates the passage of a variety of molecules across the mitochondrial outer membrane, and is central to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. VDAC1 is overexpressed in post-mortem brains of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. The development and progress of AD are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from the cytotoxic effects of accumulated amyloid beta (Abeta). In this study we demonstrate the involvement of VDAC1 and a VDAC1 N-terminal peptide (VDAC1-N-Ter) in Abeta cell penetration and cell death induction. Abeta directly interacted with VDAC1 and VDAC1-N-Ter, as monitored by VDAC1 channel conductance, surface plasmon resonance, and microscale thermophoresis. Preincubated Abeta interacted with bilayer-reconstituted VDAC1 and increased its conductance ~ 2-fold. Incubation of cells with Abeta resulted in mitochondria-mediated apoptotic cell death. However, the presence of non-cell-penetrating VDAC1-N-Ter peptide prevented Abeta cellular entry and Abeta-induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Likewise, silencing VDAC1 expression by specific siRNA prevented Abeta entry into the cytosol as well as Abeta-induced toxicity. Finally, the mode of Abeta-mediated action involves detachment of mitochondria-bound hexokinase, induction of VDAC1 oligomerization, and cytochrome c release, a sequence of events leading to apoptosis. As such, we suggest that Abeta-mediated toxicity involves mitochondrial and plasma membrane VDAC1, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis induction. The VDAC1-N-Ter peptide targeting Abeta cytotoxicity is thus a potential new therapeutic strategy for AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Fibrinogen and beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide independently form ordered aggregates but in combination, they form disordered structures which are resistant to fibrinolytic enzymes like plasmin and cause severity in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). A novel enzyme of 31.3 kDa has been isolated from the root of the medicinal plant Aristolochia indica that showed fibrinolytic as well as fibrin-Abeta co-aggregate destabilizing properties. This enzyme is functionally distinct from plasmin. Thrombolytic action of the enzyme was demonstrated in rat model. The potency of the plant enzyme in degrading fibrin and fibrin-plasma protein (Abeta, human serum albumin, lysozyme, transthyretin and fibronectin) co-aggregates was demonstrated by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy that showed better potency of the plant enzyme as compared to plasmin. Moreover, the plant enzyme inhibited localization of the co-aggregate inside SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and also co-aggregate induced cytotoxicity. Plasmin was inefficient in this respect. In the background of limited options for fragmentation of these co-aggregates, the plant enzyme may appear as a potential proteolytic enzyme.",

We used cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma CLU levels as endophenotypes for genetic studies to understand the role of CLU in AD. CSF, but not plasma, CLU levels were significantly associated with AD status and CSF tau/amyloid-beta ratio, and highly correlated with CSF apolipoprotein E (APOE) levels. Several loci showed almost genome-wide significant associations including LINC00917 (p = 3.98 x 10(-7)) and interleukin 6 (IL6, p = 9.94 x 10(-6), in the entire data set and in the APOE epsilon4- individuals p = 7.40 x 10(-8)). Gene ontology analyses suggest that CSF CLU levels may be associated with wound healing and immune response which supports previous functional studies that demonstrated an association between CLU and IL6. CLU may play a role in AD by influencing immune system changes that have been observed in AD or by disrupting healing after neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: To investigate the effects of sevoflurane inhalation on beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced cognitive disorders and hippocampal oxidative stress in rat models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cognitive dysfunction is induced by hippocampal injection of Abeta1-40 (10mug in 2mul) for 22days. To explore the effect of sevoflurane inhalation on Abeta1-40 induced cognitive disorder, two doses of sevoflurane inhalation are used: 1.3% (Abeta+S1) and 2.6% (Abeta+S2). Sham operation (Sham, for operation control), saline injection (Control, for injection control) and 30% oxygen inhalation after Abeta1-40 injection (Abeta+O2, for inhalation control) were used as controls. All rats were further tested in electrical Y-maze and Morris water maze. Serum S100beta levels, hippocampal superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, S100beta expression and malonyldialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were further quantified. KEY FINDINGS: Rats in Abeta+O2, Abeta+S1 and Abeta+S2 groups had lower number of correct actions in the electrical Y maze task, longer escape latencies, less time exploring the original platform, elevated serum S100beta levels, depressed hippocampal SOD activity, S100beta expression and higher MDA concentrations compared to control group (p<0.05). Such difference was not significant between Abeta+S1 and Abeta+O2 rats. Rats in Abeta+S2 group, however, showed significantly impaired performances compared to those in Abeta+S1 group (p<0.05). SIGNIFICANCE: Sevoflurane (2.6%) can aggravate the Abeta-induced cognitive dysfunction, possibly via the intracerebral oxidative stress response.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is a characteristic pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease. We have exploited the relationship between solvent exposure and intrinsic fluorescence of a single tyrosine residue, Tyr10, in the Abeta sequence to probe structural features of the monomeric, oligomeric and fibrillar forms of the 42-residue Abeta1-42. By monitoring the quenching of Tyr10 fluorescence upon addition of water-soluble acrylamide, we show that in Abeta1-42 oligomers this residue is solvent-exposed to a similar extent to that found in the unfolded monomer. By contrast, Tyr10 is significantly shielded from acrylamide quenching in Abeta1-42 fibrils, consistent with its proximity to the fibrillar cross-beta core. Furthermore, circular dichroism measurements reveal that Abeta1-42 oligomers have a considerably lower beta-sheet content than the Abeta1-42 fibrils, indicative of a less ordered molecular arrangement in the former. Taken together these findings suggest significant differences in the structural assembly of oligomers and fibrils that are consistent with differences in their biological effects.",

METHODS: To test whether antagonism of the type-1 corticotropin-releasing factor receptor (CRFR1) could be used as a disease-modifying treatment for AD, we used a preclinical prevention paradigm and treated 30-day-old AD transgenic mice with the small-molecule, CRFR1-selective antagonist, R121919, for 5 months, and examined AD pathologic and behavioral end points. RESULTS: R121919 significantly prevented the onset of cognitive impairment in female mice and reduced cellular and synaptic deficits and beta amyloid and C-terminal fragment-beta levels in both genders.

Excellent lot-to-lot comparability was observed (correlation coefficients [Pearson's r] >0.995; bias in medical decision area <2%). Repeatability coefficients of variation (CVs) were 1.0%-1.6%, intermediate CVs were 1.9%-4.0%, and intermodule CVs were 1.1%-3.9%. Estimated total reproducibility was 2.0%-5.1%.

Measurements of cerebrospinal fluid Abeta levels remain the most useful marker for diagnostic purposes and to individuate people at risk for AD. Despite recent advances criticized the direct role in neurodegeneration of cortical neurons, Abeta is considered responsible for synaptopathy and impairment of neurotransmission and therefore remains the major trigger of AD and future pharmacological treatment remain Abeta oriented. However, experimental and clinical findings showed that Abeta peptides could have a wider range of action responsible for cell dysfunction and for appearance of clinico-pathological entities different from AD. Such findings may induce misunderstanding of the real role played by Abeta in AD and therefore strengthen criticism on its centrality and need for CSF measurements. Aim of this review is to discuss the role of CSF Abeta levels in light of experimental, clinical pathologic, and electrophysiological results in AD and other pathological entities to put in a correct frame the value of Abeta changes.",

    "title": "The Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 2 (TRPM2) Channel Contributes to beta-Amyloid Oligomer-Related Neurotoxicity and Memory Impairment.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: In Alzheimer's disease, accumulation of soluble oligomers of beta-amyloid peptide is known to be highly toxic, causing disturbances in synaptic activity and neuronal death. Multiple studies relate these effects to increased oxidative stress and aberrant activity of calcium-permeable cation channels leading to calcium imbalance. The transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel, a Ca(2+)-permeable nonselective cation channel activated by oxidative stress, has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, and more recently in amyloid-induced toxicity. Here we show that the function of TRPM2 is augmented by treatment of cultured neurons with beta-amyloid oligomers. Aged APP/PS1 Alzheimer's mouse model showed increased levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, protein disulfide isomerase and phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha, as well as decreased levels of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin. Elimination of TRPM2 in APP/PS1 mice corrected these abnormal responses without affecting plaque burden. These effects of TRPM2 seem to be selective for beta-amyloid toxicity, as ER stress responses to thapsigargin or tunicamycin in TRPM2(-/-) neurons was identical to that of wild-type neurons. Moreover, reduced microglial activation was observed in TRPM2(-/-)/APP/PS1 hippocampus compared with APP/PS1 mice. In addition, age-dependent spatial memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice were reversed in TRPM2(-/-)/APP/PS1 mice. These results reveal the importance of TRPM2 for beta-amyloid neuronal toxicity, suggesting that TRPM2 activity could be potentially targeted to improve outcomes in Alzheimer's disease. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is an oxidative stress sensing calcium-permeable channel that is thought to contribute to calcium dysregulation associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that oligomeric beta-amyloid, the toxic peptide in Alzheimer's disease, facilitates TRPM2 channel activation. In mice designed to model Alzheimer's disease, genetic elimination of TRPM2 normalized deficits in synaptic markers in aged mice. Moreover, the absence of TRPM2 improved age-dependent spatial memory deficits observed in Alzheimer's mice. Our results reveal the importance of TRPM2 for neuronal toxicity and memory impairments in an Alzheimer's mouse model and suggest that TRPM2 could be targeted for the development of therapeutic agents effective in the treatment of dementia.",

Familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) mutations within PS1 were analyzed in yeast cells artificially expressing membrane-bound substrate, amyloid precursor protein, or Notch fused to Gal4 transcriptional activator. The FAD mutations, L166P and G384A (Leu-166 to Pro and Gly-384 to Ala substitution, respectively), were loss-of-function in yeast. We identified five amino acid substitutions that suppress the FAD mutations. The cleavage of amyloid precursor protein or Notch was recovered by the secondary mutations. We also found that secondary mutations alone activated the gamma-secretase activity. FAD mutants with suppressor mutations, L432M or S438P within TMD9 together with a missense mutation in the second or sixth loops, regained gamma-secretase activity when introduced into presenilin null mouse fibroblasts. Notably, the cells with suppressor mutants produced a decreased amount of Abeta42, which is responsible for Alzheimer disease. These results indicate that the yeast system is useful to screen for mutations and chemicals that modulate gamma-secretase activity.",

    "title": "Characterization of Abeta Monomers through the Convergence of Ensemble Properties among Simulations with Multiple Force Fields.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) monomers represent a base state in the pathways of aggregation that result in the fibrils and oligomers implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The structural properties of these intrinsically disordered peptides remain unclear despite extensive experimental and computational investigations. Further, there are mutations within Abeta that change the way the peptide aggregates and are known to cause familial AD (FAD). Here, we analyze the ensembles of different isoforms (Abeta42 and Abeta40) and mutants (E22Delta, D23N, E22K, E22G, and A2T in Abeta40) of Abeta generated with all-atom replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations on the mus/replica time scale. These were run using three different force field/water model combinations: OPLS-AA/L and TIP3P (\"OPLS\"), AMBER99sb-ILDN and TIP4P-Ew (\"ILDN\"), as well as CHARMM22* and TIP3SP (\"CHARMM\"). Despite fundamental changes in simulation parameters, we find that the resulting ensembles demonstrate a strong convergence in structural properties. In particular, antiparallel contacts between L17-A21 and A30-L34 are prevalent in ensembles of Abeta40, directly forming beta sheets in the OPLS and ILDN combinations. A21-A30 commonly forms an interceding region that rarely interacts with the rest of the peptide. Further, Abeta42 contributes new beta hairpin motifs involving V40-I41 in both OPLS and ILDN. However, the structural flexibility of the central region and the electrostatic interactions that characterize it are notably different between the different conditions. Further, for OPLS, each of the FAD mutations disrupts central bend character and increases the polymorphism of antiparallel contacts across the central region. However, the studied mutations in the ILDN set primarily encourage more global contacts involving the N-terminus and the central region, and promote the formation of new beta topologies that may seed different aggregates involved in disease phenotypes. These differences aside, the large degree of agreement between simulation sets across multiple force fields provides a generalizable characterization of Abeta that is also consistent with experimental data and models.",

    "abstract": "Known gamma-secretase inhibitors or modulators display an undesirable pharmacokinetic profile and toxicity and have therefore not been successful in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD). So far, no compounds from natural products have been identified as direct inhibitors of gamma-secretase. To search for bioactive molecules that can reduce the amount of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) and that have better pharmacokinetics and an improved safety profile, we completed a screen of ~400 natural products by using cell-based and cell-free gamma-secretase activity assays. We identified dihydroergocristine (DHEC), a component of an FDA- (Food and Drug Administration)-approved drug, to be a direct inhibitor of gamma-secretase. Micromolar concentrations of DHEC substantially reduced Abeta levels in different cell types, including a cell line derived from an AD patient. Structure-activity relationship studies implied that the key moiety for inhibiting gamma-secretase is the cyclized tripeptide moiety of DHEC. A Surface Plasmon Resonance assay showed that DHEC binds directly to gamma-secretase and Nicastrin, with equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) of 25.7 nM and 9.8 muM, respectively. This study offers DHEC not only as a new chemical moiety for selectively modulating the activity of gamma-secretase but also a candidate for drug repositioning in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Self-assembly of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide molecules into large aggregates is a naturally occurring process driven in aqueous solution by a dynamic interplay between hydrophobic interactions among Abeta molecules, which promote aggregation, and steric and overall electrostatic hindrance, which stifles it. Abeta self-association is entropically unfavorable, as it implies order increase in the system, but under favorable kinetic conditions, the process proceeds at appreciable rates, yielding Abeta aggregates of different sizes and structures. Despite the great relevance and extensive research efforts, detailed kinetic mechanisms underlying Abeta aggregation remain only partially understood. In this study, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and Thioflavin T (ThT) were used to monitor the time dependent growth of structured aggregates and characterize multiple components during the aggregation of Abeta peptides in a heterogeneous aqueous solution. To this aim, we collected data during a relatively large number of observation periods, 30 consecutive measurements lasting 10 s each, at what we consider to be a constant time point in the slow aggregation process. This approach enabled monitoring the formation of nanomolar concentrations of structured amyloid aggregates and demonstrated the changing distribution of amyloid aggregate sizes throughout the aggregation process. We identified aggregates of different sizes with molecular weight from 260 to more than 1 x 10(6) kDa and revealed the hitherto unobserved kinetic turnover of intermediates during Abeta aggregation. The effect of different Abeta concentrations, Abeta:ThT ratios, differences between the 40 (Abeta40) and 42 (Abeta42) residue long variants of Abeta, and the effect of stirring were also examined.",

    "abstract": "Using support from rational computer-assisted design, a novel series of hybrids (selenoxy-chinolin) designed by fusing the metal-chelating agent CQ and the antioxidant ebselen were synthesized and evaluated as multitarget-directed ligands. Most of the hybrids demonstrated significant ability to mimic GPx, which is highly consistent with the prediction results of DFT studies for the selenenyl sulfide intermediates in the computational design. Using (77)Se, (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS), a novel catalytic mechanism, including a new selenium quinone active species, was first demonstrated. 2D NMR studies indicated that the typical hybrid has an effective interaction with Abeta. In addition, the optimal compound 12k was found to possess an excellent ability to scavenge peroxide and to inhibit self- and metal-induced Abeta aggregation, and an ability to disassemble preformed self- and metal-induced Abeta aggregates effectively. Furthermore, 12k was able to penetrate the central nervous system (CNS) and did not exhibit any acute toxicity in mice at doses up to 2000 mg kg(-1). Overall, we demonstrated that hybrid 12k, through rational structure-based computational design, shows a potential for development as a therapeutic agent in AD.",

To investigate genetic associations with amyloid-beta we used biomarker data and genome-wide variants from individuals with AD and mild cognitive impairment in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We used a standard linear model and retested the associations with a mixed linear model to correct the residual sample structure. Both methods' results showed two identical significant SNPs associated with the A beta-42 levels in CSF (rs2075650 at intron region TOMM40 with p-value >= 1 x 10-16 and rs439401 in the intergenic region of LOC100129500 and APOC1 with p-value >= 1 x 10-9) and highlighted APOC1 and TOMM40, which are well-known genes previously associated with AD. Extending our analysis, we considered possible candidate genes mapped to SNPs with p-value >= 1 x 10-6 to explore gene-set enrichment e gene-gene network analysis, which reveals genes related to synaptic transmission, transmission of nerve impulses, cell-cell signaling and neurological processes.

A possible mechanism may be via ischemic infarction-driving amyloid deposition. We conducted a study to determine the presence of beta-amyloid in infarct, peri-infarct, and hemispheric areas after stroke. We hypothesized that an infarct would trigger beta-amyloid deposition, with deposition over time. METHODS: Patients were recruited within 40 days of acute ischemic stroke and imaged with computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging and Pittsburgh compound B (11C-PiB) positron emission tomographic scans. Follow-up positron emission tomographic scanning was performed in a subgroup <=18 months after the stroke event. Standardized uptake value ratios for regions of interest were analyzed after coregistration. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were imaged with (11)C-PiB positron emission tomography. There was an increase in (11)C-PiB accumulation in the stroke area compared with a reference region in the contralesional hemisphere, which was not statistically significant (median difference in standardized uptake value ratio, 0.07 [95% confidence interval, -0.06 to 0.123]; P=0.452). There was no significant increase in the accumulation of (11)C-PiB in the peri-infarct region or in the ipsilesional hemisphere (median difference in standardized uptake value ratio, 0.04 [95% confidence interval, -0.02 to 0.10]; P=0.095). We repeated (11)C-PiB positron emission tomography in 21 patients and found a significant reduction in accumulation of (11)C-PiB between regions of interest (median difference in standardized uptake value ratio, -0.08 [95% confidence interval, -0.23 to -0.03]; P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant increase in (11)C-PiB accumulation in or around the infarct. There was no increase in ipsilesional hemispheric (11)C-PiB accumulation over time. We found no evidence that infarction leads to sustained or increased beta-amyloid deposition <=18 months after stroke.",

ProSP-C (prosurfactant protein C) BRICHOS binds to stretches of hydrophobic amino acid residues, which are unfolded or in beta-strand conformation, suggesting that it may have broad anti-amyloid activity. We have studied the effect of the proSP-C BRICHOS domain on the designed amyloidogenic beta-sheet proteins beta17 and beta23. beta17 expressed in the secretory pathway of HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells forms intracellular inclusions, whereas beta23 is rapidly degraded. Co-expression of BRICHOS leads to a reduction in beta17 inclusion size and increased levels of soluble beta17 and beta23. Furthermore, BRICHOS interacts with the beta-proteins intracellularly, reduces their ubiquitination and decreases aggresome formation and proteasomal inhibition. Collectively, these data suggest that BRICHOS is capable of delaying the aggregation process and toxicity of amyloidogenic proteins in a generic manner.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction has been recognized as an early event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, preceding and inducing neurodegeneration and memory loss. The presence of cytochrome c (CytC) released from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm is often detected after acute or chronic neurodegenerative insults, including AD. The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (CAI) methazolamide (MTZ) was identified among a library of drugs as an inhibitor of CytC release and proved to be neuroprotective in Huntington's disease and stroke models. Here, using neuronal and glial cell cultures, in addition to an acute model of amyloid beta (Abeta) toxicity, which replicates by intra-hippocampal injection the consequences of interstitial and cellular accumulation of Abeta, we analyzed the effects of MTZ on neuronal and glial degeneration induced by the Alzheimer's amyloid. MTZ prevented DNA fragmentation, CytC release and activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3 induced by Abeta in neuronal and glial cells in culture through the inhibition of mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production. Moreover, intraperitoneal administration of MTZ prevented neurodegeneration induced by intra-hippocampal Abeta injection in the mouse brain and was effective at reducing caspase 3 activation in neurons and microglia in the area surrounding the injection site. Our results, delineating the molecular mechanism of action of MTZ against Abeta-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase activation, and demonstrating its efficiency in a model of acute amyloid-mediated toxicity, provide the first combined in vitro and in vivo evidence supporting the potential of a new therapy employing FDA-approved CAIs in AD.",

    "abstract": "Generation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in Alzheimer's disease involves cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by gamma-secretase, a protease known to cleave several substrates, including Notch. Finding specific modulators for gamma-secretase could be a potential avenue to treat the disease. Here, we report that transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 6 specifically interacts with APP leading to inhibition of its cleavage by gamma-secretase and reduction in Abeta production. TRPC6 interacts with APP (C99), but not with Notch, and prevents C99 interaction with presenilin 1 (PS1). A fusion peptide derived from TRPC6 also reduces Abeta levels without effect on Notch cleavage. Crossing APP/PS1 mice with TRPC6 transgenic mice leads to a marked reduction in both plaque load and Abeta levels, and improvement in structural and behavioural impairment. Thus, TRPC6 specifically modulates gamma-secretase cleavage of APP and preventing APP (C99) interaction with PS1 via TRPC6 could be a novel strategy to reduce Abeta formation.",

    "title": "Peroxiredoxin 5 prevents amyloid-beta oligomer-induced neuronal cell death by inhibiting ERK-Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is caused by amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaOs). AbetaOs induce cell death by triggering oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. A recent study showed that AbetaO-induced oxidative stress is associated with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fission. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are regulated by antioxidant enzymes, especially peroxiredoxins (Prxs) that scavenge H2O2. These enzymes inhibit neuronal cell death induced by various neurotoxic reagents. However, it is unclear whether Prx5, which is specifically expressed in neuronal cells, protects these cells from AbetaO-induced damage. In this study, we found that Prx5 expression was upregulated by AbetaO-induced oxidative stress and that Prx5 decreased ERK-Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis of HT-22 neuronal cells. Prx5 expression was affected by AbetaO, and amelioration of oxidative stress by N-acetyl-L-cysteine decreased AbetaO-induced Prx5 expression. Prx5 overexpression reduced ROS as well as RNS and apoptotic cell death but Prx5 knockdown did not. In addition, Prx5 overexpression ameliorated ERK-Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation but Prx5 knockdown did not. These results indicated that inducible Prx5 expression by AbetaO plays a key role in inhibiting both ERK-Drp1-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and neuronal cell death by regulating oxidative stress. Thus, Prx5 may be a new therapeutic agent for treating AD.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is an important modifier of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, and its abundance has been linked to the clearance of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brain. The pathways that control the clearance of ApoE in the brain are incompletely understood. We report that Idol, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) for degradation, is a critical determinant of brain ApoE metabolism and Abeta plaque biogenesis. Previous work has shown that Idol contributes minimally to the regulation of hepatic LDLR expression in mice. By contrast, we demonstrate that Idol is a primary physiological regulator of LDLR protein in the brain, controlling the clearance of both ApoE-containing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and Abeta. We studied the consequences of loss of Idol expression in a transgenic mouse model of Abeta amyloidosis. Idol deficiency increased brain LDLR, decreased ApoE, decreased soluble and insoluble Abeta, reduced amyloid plaque burden, and ameliorated neuroinflammation. These findings identify Idol as a gatekeeper of LDLR-dependent ApoE and Abeta clearance in the brain and a potential enzyme target for therapeutic intervention in AD.",

    "title": "Detection of Cyclooxygenase-1 in Activated Microglia During Amyloid Plaque Progression: PET Studies in Alzheimer's Disease Model Mice.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Cyclooxygenase (COX), a prostanoid-synthesizing enzyme, is considered to be involved in the neuroinflammatory process of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the role of COX in the progression of neurodegeneration is not well understood. We hypothesized that in vivo imaging of COX by PET will contribute to elucidation of the function of COX during the neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer's disease (AD). (11)C-labeled ketoprofen methyl ester (racemic (RS)-(11)C-KTP-Me) developed recently by our group is a useful PET probe for in vivo imaging of COX-1 during neuroinflammation. The (S)-enantiomer of ketoprofen is known to be pharmacologically more active than the (R)-enantiomer. We thus synthesized (11)C-labeled (S)-ketoprofen methyl ester ((S)-(11)C-KTP-Me) as an improved PET probe specific for COX-1 and applied it for investigation of the changes in COX-1 during the progression of AD in a mouse model. METHODS: The specificity of (S)-(11)C-KTP-Me for COXs was examined in PET studies with rats that had intrastriatal injection of lipopolysaccharide. To determine the details of changes in COX-1 during progression of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque formation in amyloid precursor protein transgenic (APP-Tg) mice, we performed immunohistochemical studies and ex vivo autoradiography with (S)-(11)C-KTP-Me. RESULTS: PET studies using hemispheric lipopolysaccharide injection into rats revealed that the sensitivity of (S)-(11)C-KTP-Me in neuroinflammation was much higher than that of (RS)-(11)C-KTP-Me and (R)-(11)C-KTP-Me; these results closely corresponded to the inhibitory activities of each enantiomer against COX-1 estimated by an in vitro assay. In APP-Tg mice, (S)-(11)C-KTP-Me administration resulted in progressive and significant increases in accumulation of radioactivity in the brain from 16 to 24 mo old in accordance with the histopathologic appearance of abundant Abeta plaques and activated microglia, whereas few changes in radioactivity accumulation and few Abeta plaques were seen in age-matched wild-type control mice. High-radioactivity accumulation by (S)-(11)C-KTP-Me was markedly observed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus in which COX-1-expressing activated microglia tightly surrounded and enclosed large and more intensely stained Abeta plaques, indicating neuroinflammation that originated with Abeta. CONCLUSION: (S)-(11)C-KTP-Me is a potent PET probe that is highly selective for COX-1. Studies using APP-Tg mice demonstrated that (S)-(11)C-KTP-Me could detect activated microglia that are associated with amyloid plaque progression, suggesting the involvement of COX-1 in the neuroinflammatory process in AD.",

Here, obestatin effects were investigated on proliferation and survival of adult rat hippocampal progenitor cells (AHPs). Obestatin immunoreactivity was found in AHPs; moreover, obestatin binding to AHPs was displaced by the GLP-1R agonist Ex-4 and antagonist Ex-9. Furthermore, obestatin increased cell proliferation and survival in growth factor deprived medium and inhibited apoptosis; these effects were blocked by Ex-9. The underlying mechanisms involved Galphas/cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt, and the PI3K targets GSK-3beta/beta-catenin and mTOR. Obestatin also counteracted Abeta1-42-induced detrimental effects through inhibition of GSK-3beta activity and Tau hyperphosphorylation, main hallmarks of neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease. These findings indicate a novel protective role for obestatin in AHPs and candidate this peptide as potential therapeutic target for increasing neurogenesis and for approaching neurodegenerative disorders.",

We used survival analysis methods to quantify risk of accumulating Abeta and differences in onset age of Abeta accumulation in relation to APOE epsilon4 status and sex among 36 APOE epsilon4 carriers and 83 noncarriers. RESULTS: Age at onset of Abeta accumulation for the APOE epsilon4- and epsilon4+ groups was 73.1 and 60.7, respectively. APOE epsilon4 positivity conferred a threefold risk of accumulating Abeta after adjusting for sex and education. DISCUSSION: Estimation of onset age of amyloid accumulation may help gauge treatment efficacy in interventions to delay symptom onset in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-16 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to explore its mechanism of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cellular AD model using PC12 cells and primary hippocampal neurons was established to evaluate the expression level of miR-16. Transfection of a miR-16 mimic and a miR-16 inhibitor were performed to explore its effect on cell apoptosis and cell viability. In addition, we carried out bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporting gene assay, and gene expression analyses to identify the potential target of miR-16 and to verify the effect of the target gene on the cellular AD model. RESULTS: Downregulation of miR-16 was confirmed in the cellular AD model with both PC12 cells (p < 0.05) and primary hippocampal neurons (p < 0.05). Overexpression and inhibition of miR-16 in the cellular AD model with primary hippocampal neurons decreased and increased apoptosis, respectively. The gene encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) was identified as the target gene of miR-16. Knockdown of APP in primary hippocampal neurons decreased cell apoptosis and increased cell viability in the cellular AD model. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that downregulation of miR-16 in primary hippocampal neurons play an important role in the paracrine effect and might be involved in the development of AD.",

    "title": "Acceleration of amyloidogenesis and memory impairment by estrogen deficiency through NF-kappaB dependent beta-secretase activation in presenilin 2 mutant mice.",
    "abstract": "Nearly 7-10 million people are living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) worldwide. Senile plaques composed of beta-amyloid (Abeta) are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Presenilin 2 (PS2) mutations increase Abeta generation in the brains of AD patients. The Abeta is generated through the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by beta- and gamma-secretases. Additionally, increasing evidences suggest that estrogen can reduce the development of AD via regulation of beta-secretases activity and beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) expression. But the underlying correlation mechanism of Abeta generation by PS2 mutations and estrogen remains to be clarified. To investigate the anti-amyloidogenesis effect of estrogen in a PS2 mutative condition, we examined memory impairment in ovariectomized PS2 mutation (N141I) mice in which cognitive function was assessed by the Morris water maze test and passive avoidance test. In addition, Western blot analysis, immunostaining, immunofluorescence staining, ELISA and enzyme activity assays were used to examine the degree of Abeta deposition in the brains. In the present study, Abeta accumulated more in the ovariectomized PS2 mutant mice brain, and greatly worsened memory impairment and glial activation as well as neurogenic inflammation. In parallel with increased memory impairment, activity of beta-secretase and expression of the BACE1 increased inovariectomized PS2 mutant mice. Much higher activity of NF-kappaB was observed by EMSA in ovariectomized PS2 mutant mice. In addition, the Abeta level was decreased by treatment of beta-estradiol through inhibiting BACE1 expression in PS2 transfacted PC12 cells. These results suggest that mutation of PS2 can lead to NF-kappaB mediate amyloidogensis, and this effect can be amplified by the absence of estrogen.",

    "title": "Transition rates between amyloid and neurodegeneration biomarker states and to dementia: a population-based, longitudinal cohort study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In a 2014 cross-sectional analysis, we showed that amyloid and neurodegeneration biomarker states in participants with no clinical impairment varied greatly with age, suggesting dynamic within-person processes. In this longitudinal study, we aimed to estimate rates of transition from a less to a more abnormal biomarker state by age in individuals without dementia, as well as to assess rates of transition to dementia from an abnormal state. METHODS: Participants from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (Olmsted County, MN, USA) without dementia at baseline were included in this study, a subset of whom agreed to multimodality imaging. Amyloid PET (with (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B) was used to classify individuals as amyloid positive (A(+)) or negative (A(-)). (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG)-PET and MRI were used to classify individuals as neurodegeneration positive (N(+)) or negative (N(-)). We used all observations, including those from participants who did not have imaging results, to construct a multistate Markov model to estimate four different age-specific biomarker state transition rates: A(-)N(-) to A(+)N(-); A(-)N(-) to A(-)N(+) (suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology); A(+)N(-) to A(+)N(+); and A(-)N(+) to A(+)N(+). We also estimated two age-specific rates to dementia: A(+)N(+) to dementia and A(-)N(+) to dementia. Using these state-to-state transition rates, we estimated biomarker state frequencies by age. FINDINGS: At baseline (between Nov 29, 2004, to March 7, 2015), 4049 participants did not have dementia (3512 [87%] were clinically normal and 537 [13%] had mild cognitive impairment). 1541 individuals underwent imaging between March 28, 2006, to April 30, 2015. Transition rates were low at age 50 years and, with one exception, exponentially increased with age. At age 85 years compared with age 65 years, the rate was nearly 11-times higher (17.2 vs 1.6 per 100 person-years) for the transition from A(-)N(-) to A(-)N(+), three-times higher (20.8 vs 6.1) for A(+)N(-) to A(+)N(+), and five-times higher (13.2 vs 2.6) for A(-)N(+) to A(+)N(+). The rate of transition was also increased at age 85 years compared with age 65 years for A(+)N(+) to dementia (7.0 vs 0.8) and for A(-)N(+) to dementia (1.7 vs 0.6). The one exception to an exponential increase with age was the transition rate from A(-)N(-) to A(+)N(-), which increased from 4.0 transitions per 100 person-years at age 65 years to 6.9 transitions per 100 person-years at age 75 and then plateaued beyond that age. Estimated biomarker frequencies by age from the multistate model were similar to cross-sectional biomarker frequencies. INTERPRETATION: Our transition rates suggest that brain ageing is a nearly inevitable acceleration toward worse biomarker and clinical states. The one exception is the transition to amyloidosis without neurodegeneration, which is most dynamic from age 60 years to 70 years and then plateaus beyond that age. We found that simple transition rates can explain complex, highly interdependent biomarker state frequencies in our population.

    "abstract": "During early postnatal development retinocollicular projections undergo activity-dependent synaptic refinement that results in the formation of precise topographical maps in the visual layers of the superior colliculus (SC). Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is a widely expressed transmembrane glycoprotein involved in the regulation of several aspects of neural development, such as neurite outgrowth, synapse formation and plasticity. Stimulation of cholinergic system has been found to alter the expression and processing of APP in different cell lines. Herein, we investigated the effect of nicotine on the development of retinocollicular pathway and on APP metabolism in the SC of pigmented rats. Animals were submitted to intracranial Elvax implants loaded with nicotine or phosphate-buffered saline (vehicle) at postnatal day (PND) 7. The ipsilateral retinocollicular pathway of control and experimental groups was anterogradely labeled either 1 or 3 weeks after surgery (PND 14 or PND 28). Local nicotine exposure produces a transitory sprouting of uncrossed retinal axons outside their main terminal zones. Nicotine also increases APP content and its soluble neurotrophic fragment sAPPalpha. Furthermore, nicotine treatment upregulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 and beta2 subunits. Taken together, these data indicate that nicotine disrupts the ordering and topographic mapping of axons in the retinocollicular pathway and facilitates APP processing through the nonamyloidogenic pathway, suggesting that sAPPalpha may act as a trophic agent that mediates nicotine-induced morphological plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies with conformational specificity are important for detecting and interfering with polypeptide aggregation linked to several human disorders. We are developing a motif-grafting approach for designing lead antibody candidates specific for amyloid-forming polypeptides such as the Alzheimer peptide (Abeta). This approach involves grafting amyloidogenic peptide segments into the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of single-domain (VH) antibodies. Here we have investigated the impact of polar mutations inserted at the edges of a large hydrophobic Abeta42 peptide segment (Abeta residues 17-42) in CDR3 on the solubility and conformational specificity of the corresponding VH domains. We find that VH expression and solubility are strongly enhanced by introducing multiple negatively charged or asparagine residues at the edges of CDR3, whereas other polar mutations are less effective (glutamine and serine) or ineffective (threonine, lysine, and arginine). Moreover, Abeta VH domains with negatively charged CDR3 mutations show significant preference for recognizing Abeta fibrils relative to Abeta monomers, whereas the same VH domains with other polar CDR3 mutations recognize both Abeta conformers. We observe similar behavior for a VH domain grafted with a large hydrophobic peptide from islet amyloid polypeptide (residues 8-37) that contains negatively charged mutations at the edges of CDR3.

    "abstract": "The presenilin 1 (PSEN1) L271V mutation causes early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease by disrupting the alternative splicing of the PSEN1 gene, producing some transcripts harboring the L271V point mutation and other transcripts lacking exon 8 (PS1( exon8)). We previously reported that PS1 L271V increased amyloid beta (Abeta) 42/40 ratios, while PS1( exon8) reduced Abeta42/40 ratios, indicating that the former and not the exon 8 deletion transcript is amyloidogenic. Also, PS1( exon8) did not rescue Abeta generation in PS1/2 double knockout cells indicating its identity as a severe loss-of-function splice form. PS1( exon8) is generated physiologically raising the possibility that we had identified the first physiological inactive PS1 isoform. We studied PS1( exon8) in vivo by crossing PS1( exon8) transgenics with either PS1-null or Dutch APP(E693Q) mice. As a control, we crossed APP(E693Q) with mice expressing a deletion in an adjacent exon (PS1( exon9)). PS1( exon8) did not rescue embryonic lethality or Notch-deficient phenotypes of PS1-null mice displaying severe loss of function in vivo. We also demonstrate that this splice form can interact with wildtype PS1 using cultured cells and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)/bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Further co-IP demonstrates that PS1( exon8) interacts with nicastrin, participating in the gamma-secretase complex formation. These data support that catalytically inactive PS1( exon8) is generated physiologically and participates in protein-protein interactions.",

We show that the neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) is enriched in synapses in the human hippocampus. This enrichment is abolished in the hippocampus of AD patients and in brains of mice overexpressing the human amyloid-beta (Abeta) precursor protein carrying the pathogenic Swedish mutation. Abeta binds to NCAM2 at the cell surface of cultured hippocampal neurons and induces removal of NCAM2 from synapses. In AD hippocampus, cleavage of the membrane proximal external region of NCAM2 is increased and soluble extracellular fragments of NCAM2 (NCAM2-ED) accumulate. Knockdown of NCAM2 expression or incubation with NCAM2-ED induces disassembly of GluR1-containing glutamatergic synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons. Abeta-dependent disassembly of GluR1-containing synapses is inhibited in neurons overexpressing a cleavage-resistant mutant of NCAM2. Our data indicate that Abeta-dependent disruption of NCAM2 functions in AD hippocampus contributes to synapse loss.",

    "abstract": "Identification of the chemical and biological properties of amyloid fibrils is important for understanding their roles in human diseases and to clarify the mechanisms that govern their formation. In pursuit of these goals, small molecule fluorescent dyes have received increasing attention as probes of amyloid conformations. In this study, we report on the ability of YOYO-1, a homodimeric derivative of oxazole yellow, to detect fibrils formed by the Alzheimer's disease related Abeta(1-42) peptide. We find that YOYO-1 binds to Abeta(1-42) fibrils with the long axes of its oxazole yellow moieties parallel to the fibril axis, resulting in a 200x emission enhancement; a result that shows that YOYO-1 is a sensitive amyloid probe. Further, YOYO-1 exhibits characteristic absorption shifts upon binding to the Abeta(1-42) fibrils that we attribute to a self-stacking to non-stacking transition in its homodimer configuration; herein we show how this phenomenon can be exploited to estimate the degree of dye binding. Furthermore, we show that YOYO-1 can be used to monitor the kinetics of amyloid formation reactions. Taken together, our results show that YOYO-1 is a sensitive amyloid probe that can operate with both absorption and fluorescence read-outs, and this suggests that this commercially available dye could become a useful complement to thioflavin-T for in vitro amyloid-sensing applications.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. With respect to amyloid deposition, there are no published serial data regarding the deposition rate of amyloid throughout the brain after TBI. The authors conducted serial (18)F-AV-45 (florbetapir F18) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in 2 patients with severe TBI at 1, 12, and 24 months after injury. A total of 12 brain regions were surveyed for changes in amyloid levels. Case 1 involved a 50-year-old man who experienced a severe TBI. Compared with the 1-month time point, of the 12 brain regions that were surveyed, a decrease in amyloid (as indicated by standard uptake value ratios) was only observed in the hippocampus (-16%, left; -12%, right) and caudate nucleus (-18%, left; -18%, right), suggesting that initial amyloid accumulation in the brain was cleared between time points 1 and 12 months after injury. Compared to the scan at 1 year, a greater increase in amyloid (+15%) was observed in the right hippocampus at the 24-month time point. The patient in Case 2 was a 37-year-old man who suffered severe trauma to the head and a subsequent stroke; he had poor cognitive/functional outcomes and underwent 1.5 years of rehabilitation. Due to a large infarct area on the injured side of the brain (right side), the authors focused primarily on brain regions affected within the left hemisphere. Compared with the 1-month scan, they only found an increase in brain amyloid within the left anterior putamen (+11%) at 12 months after injury. In contrast, decreased amyloid burden was detected in the left caudate nucleus (-48%), occipital cortex (-21%), and precuneus (-19%) brain regions at the 12-month time point, which is indicative of early accumulation and subsequent clearance. In comparison with 12-month values, more clearance was observed, since a reduction in amyloid was found at 24 months after trauma within the left anterior putamen (-12%) and occipital cortex (-15%). Also, by 24 months, most of the amyloid had been cleared and the patient demonstrated improved results on the Rivermead symptom questionnaire, Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended, and Disability Rating Scale. With respect to APOE status, the patient in Case 1 had two epsilon3 alleles and the patient in Case 2 had one epsilon2 and one epsilon3 allele. In comparison to the findings of the initial scan at 1 month after TBI, by 12 and 24 months after injury amyloid was cleared in some brain regions and increased in others. Serial imaging conducted here suggests that florbetapir F18 PET imaging may be useful in monitoring amyloid dynamics within specific brain regions following severe TBI and may be predictive of cognitive deficits.",

    "abstract": "Excessive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) caused by cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is thought to be the primary cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Two key enzymes ADAM10 and BACE1 are involved in the initial cleavage of APP, resulting in the onset of two pathways, the amyloidogenic pathway and the non-amyloidogenic pathway, respectively. Altering APP metabolism towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway is thought to reduce Abeta production. It has been reported that, in vivo, exogenous neurotrophic factors make APP apt to entering the non-amyloidogenic pathway. Since astrocytes secrete a battery of neurotrophic factors, we investigated the role of astrocyte-derived factors in the dynamics of Abeta generation in neural cells. Results show that C6 glioma cell-conditioned medium (GCM), obtained from cultured astrocyte-derived C6 glioma cells, inhibit Abeta1-42 production and shift APP processing towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway in APPswe-HEK293 cells. Such effect is attributed to two key APP cleavage enzymes, ADAM10 and BACE1. Two neurotrophic factors in the GCM, nerve growth factor and fibroblast growth factor 2, are responsible for the up-regulation of ADAM10 and down-regulation of BACE1, respectively. Our findings enhance our understanding of the relationship between astrocytes and Abeta generation, indicating that stimulation of astrocytic neurotrophic factors could slow AD progression.",

    "abstract": "According to the neurovascular hypothesis, impairment of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) in brain capillaries of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) contributes to neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) brain accumulation and drives Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, due to conflicting reports on the involvement of LRP1 in Abeta transport and the expression of LRP1 in brain endothelium, the role of LRP1 at the BBB is uncertain. As global Lrp1 deletion in mice is lethal, appropriate models to study the function of LRP1 are lacking. Moreover, the relevance of systemic Abeta clearance to AD pathology remains unclear, as no BBB-specific knockout models have been available. Here, we developed transgenic mouse strains that allow for tamoxifen-inducible deletion of Lrp1 specifically within brain endothelial cells (Slco1c1-CreER(T2) Lrp1(fl/fl) mice) and used these mice to accurately evaluate LRP1-mediated Abeta BBB clearance in vivo. Selective deletion of Lrp1 in the brain endothelium of C57BL/6 mice strongly reduced brain efflux of injected [125I] Abeta(1-42). Additionally, in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, brain endothelial-specific Lrp1 deletion reduced plasma Abeta levels and elevated soluble brain Abeta, leading to aggravated spatial learning and memory deficits, thus emphasizing the importance of systemic Abeta elimination via the BBB. Together, our results suggest that receptor-mediated Abeta BBB clearance may be a potential target for treatment and prevention of Abeta brain accumulation in AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) age of onset (ADAOO) varies greatly between individuals, with unique causal mutations suggesting the role of modifying genetic and environmental interactions. We analyzed ~50 000 common and rare functional genomic variants from 71 individuals of the 'Paisa' pedigree, the world's largest pedigree segregating a severe form of early-onset AD, who were affected carriers of the fully penetrant E280A mutation in the presenilin-1 (PSEN1) gene. Affected carriers with ages at the extremes of the ADAOO distribution (30s-70s age range), and linear mixed-effects models were used to build single-locus regression models outlining the ADAOO. We identified the rs7412 (APOE*E2 allele) as a whole exome-wide ADAOO modifier that delays ADAOO by ~12 years (beta=11.74, 95% confidence interval (CI): 8.07-15.41, P=6.31 x 10(-8), PFDR=2.48 x 10(-3)). Subsequently, to evaluate comprehensively the APOE (apolipoprotein E) haplotype variants (E1/E2/E3/E4), the markers rs7412 and rs429358 were genotyped in 93 AD affected carriers of the E280A mutation. We found that the APOE*E2 allele, and not APOE*E4, modifies ADAOO in carriers of the E280A mutation (beta=8.24, 95% CI: 4.45-12.01, P=3.84 x 10(-5)). Exploratory linear mixed-effects multilocus analysis suggested that other functional variants harbored in genes involved in cell proliferation, protein degradation, apoptotic and immune dysregulation processes (i.e., GPR20, TRIM22, FCRL5, AOAH, PINLYP, IFI16, RC3H1 and DFNA5) might interact with the APOE*E2 allele. Interestingly, suggestive evidence as an ADAOO modifier was found for one of these variants (GPR20) in a set of patients with sporadic AD from the Paisa genetic isolate. This is the first study demonstrating that the APOE*E2 allele modifies the natural history of AD typified by the age of onset in E280A mutation carriers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest analyzed sample of patients with a unique mutation sharing uniform environment. Formal replication of our results in other populations and in other forms of AD will be crucial for prediction, follow-up and presumably developing new therapeutic strategies for patients either at risk or affected by AD.",

    "abstract": "It is well known the role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and of other neurodegenerative pathologies. We have previously documented that Amyloid beta peptide (1-42) (Abeta) dependent-oxidative modifications affect red blood cell (RBC) morphology and function. Experimental studies show that caffeine (CF) consumption is inversely correlated with AD. In this study, we investigated the role played by RBC in the protective mechanism elicited by CF against Abeta mediated toxicity. PS exposure levels by FACS analysis, as well as protein band 3 functionality analysis, indicated that CF at 100 muM protected against Abeta-mediated membrane alterations, which are known to occur in AD. Moreover, CF counteracts inhibition of ATP release from RBC by Abeta, restoring its ability to modulate vasodilation. Concurrently, analysis of protein kinase C (PKC) and caspase 3 activities, responsible for cytoskeleton alterations, revealed that unlike to caspase 3, PKCalpha activation induced by Abeta was fully abolished by CF through a mechanism involving Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), located on external face of RBC plasma membrane. These results provide support for the hypothesis concerning the protective role of CF in AD patients could include also a peripheral mechanism involving RBC.",

We demonstrate that the antibody NT4X and its Fab fragment reacting with both the free N-terminus of Abeta4-x and pyroglutamate Abeta3-X mitigated neuron loss in Tg4-42 mice expressing Abeta4-42 and completely rescued spatial reference memory deficits after passive immunization.

NT4X reduced pyroglutamate Abeta3-x, Abetax-40 and Thioflavin-S positive plaque load after passive immunization of 5XFAD mice. Abeta1-x and Abetax-42 plaque deposits were unchanged.

    "abstract": "Amyloid-forming proteins undergo a structural transition from alpha-helical to disordered conformations and, ultimately, cross-beta fibrils. The unfolding and aggregation of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) have been implicated in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). However, the events underlying the initial structural transition leading to the disease state remain unclear. Although most cases are sporadic, several genetic variants exist that alter the electrostatic properties of Abeta and lead to more rapid unfolding and more severe phenotypes. In the present study, the enhanced unfolding is shown to be due to the mutated side chains altering the local peptide-bond dipole moments leading to local destabilization of the alpha-helix, as determined from polarizable molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of wild-type (WT) Abeta fragments and several common mutations. The local perturbation of the helix then leads to progressive unwinding of the alpha-helix in a cooperative fashion due to decreases in adjacent (i +- 1) and hydrogen-bonded (i + 4) peptide-bond dipole moments. Side-chain dynamics, subsequent variations in dipole moments, and ultimately the response in the peptide-bond dipole moments are all modulated by solvent dielectric properties based on simulations in water versus ethanol. The polarizable simulation results, along with simulations using the additive CHARMM36 force field, further indicate that cooperativity due to the alignment of peptide bonds leading to enhanced dipole moments is a fundamental force in stabilizing alpha-helices.",

    "abstract": "Tg2576 mice are widely used to study amyloid-dependent synaptic dysfunction related to Alzheimer's disease. However, conflicting data have been reported for these mice with regard to basal transmission as well as the in vitro correlate of memory, long-term potentiation (LTP). Some studies show clear impairments, whereas others report no deficiency. The present study uses hippocampal slices from 3-, 10-, and 15-month-old wild-type (WT) and Tg2576 mice to evaluate synaptic function in each group, including experiments to investigate basal synaptic transmission, short- and long-term plasticity by inducing paired-pulse facilitation, and both early and late LTP. We show that synaptic function remains intact in hippocampal slices from Tg2576 mice at 3 months of age. However, both early and late LTP decline progressively during aging in these mice. This deterioration of synaptic plasticity starts affecting early LTP, ultimately leading to the abolishment of both forms of LTP in 15-month-old animals. In comparison, WT littermates display normal synaptic parameters during aging. Additional pharmacological investigation into the involvement of NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels in LTP suggests a distinct mechanism of induction among age groups, demonstrating that both early and late LTP are differentially affected by these channels in Tg2576 mice during aging.",

Our aim was to perform a meta-analysis of the role of imaging techniques, including image acquisition, field strength and scanner type, and clinical and demographic factors on the reported prevalence of microbleeds in Alzheimer disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prevalence of microbleeds was examined with respect to a priori-selected moderating variables via meta-analytic tools of literature reports. RESULTS: Fourteen unique studies providing 15 microbleed prevalence rates met the selection criteria for inclusion. The aggregate prevalence of microbleeds was 24% (95% CI, 19%-28%). Scan (SWI = 40%, gradient echo = 18%, EPI = 19%) and field strength (slope = 0.39; standard error = 15, P < .01) influenced the prevalence of microbleeds. The associations between microbleeds and age, sex, and global cognitive status were not significant. After updating the literature, the aggregate prevalence remained in the 95% CI range. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging technique and field strength are strongly associated with the prevalence of microbleeds over the global aggregate. Standardized imaging protocols for identification of microbleeds are recommended to minimize confounds.",

Satureja bachtiarica is a medicinal plant from the Lamiaceae family which was widely used in Iranian traditional medicine. The aim of the present study was to investigate possible protective effects of S. bachtiarica methanolic extract on Abeta induced spatial memory impairment in Morris Water Maze (MWM), oxidative stress and cholinergic neuron degeneration. Pre- aggregated Abeta was injected into the hippocampus of each rat bilaterally (10 mug/rat) and MWM task was performed 14 days later to evaluate learning and memory function. Methanolic extract of S.bachtiarica (10, 50 and 100 mg/Kg) was injected intraperitoneally for 19 consecutive days, after Abeta injection. After the probe test the brain tissue were collected and lipid peroxidation, Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and Cholin Acetyl Transferees (ChAT) immunorectivity were measured in the hippocampus. Intrahipocampal injection of Abeta impaired learning and memory in MWM in training days and probe trail. Methanolic extract of S. bachtiarica (50 and 100 mg/Kg) could attenuate Abeta-induced memory deficit. ChAT immunostaining revealed that cholinergic neurons were loss in Abeta- injected group and S. bachtiarica (100 mg/Kg) could ameliorate Abeta- induced ChAT reduction in the hippocampus. Also S. bachtiarica could ameliorate Abeta-induced lipid peroxidation and AChE activity increase in the hippocampus. In conclusion our study represent that S.bachtiarica methanolic extract can improve Abeta-induced memory impairment and cholinergic loss then we recommended this extract as a candidate for further investigation in treatment of AD.",

Despite much research, neuronal locales of APP and BACE-1 convergence and APP cleavage remain unclear. Here we report an optical assay, based on fluorescence complementation, for visualizing in cellulo APP-BACE-1 interactions as a simple on/off signal. Combining this with other assays tracking the fate of internalized APP in hippocampal neurons, we found that APP and BACE-1 interacted in both biosynthetic and endocytic compartments, particularly along recycling microdomains such as dendritic spines and presynaptic boutons. In axons, APP and BACE-1 were cotransported, and they also interacted during transit. Finally, our assay revealed that the Alzheimer's disease-protective 'Icelandic' mutation greatly attenuates APP-BACE-1 interactions, suggesting a mechanistic basis for protection. Collectively, the data challenge canonical models and provide concrete insights into long-standing controversies in the field.",

Regional [18F]florbetapir (AV45) standardized uptake volume ratios were obtained via semiautomated quantitative analysis using the cerebellum as reference region. Gait speed was measured by timing participants while they walked 4 meters. Associations were explored with linear regression, correcting for age, sex, education, body mass index (BMI), and APOE genotype. RESULTS: We found a significant association between Abeta in the posterior and anterior putamen, occipital cortex, precuneus, and anterior cingulate and slow gait speed (all corrected p < 0.05). A multivariate model emphasized the locations of the posterior putamen and the precuneus. Abeta burden explained up to 9% of the variance in gait speed, and significantly improved regression models already containing demographic variables, BMI, and APOE status. CONCLUSIONS: The present PET study confirms, in vivo, previous postmortem evidence showing an association between Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology and gait speed, and provides additional evidence on potential regional effects of brain Abeta on motor function. More research is needed to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying these regional associations, which may involve motor and sensorimotor circuits hitherto largely neglected in the pathophysiology of AD.",

Because of these overlapping features, diagnosing DLB is challenging and has clinical implications since some therapeutic agents that are applicable in other diseases have adverse effects in DLB. Having shown that DLB shares some genetic risk with PD and AD, we have now quantified the amount of sharing through the application of genetic correlation estimates, and show that, from a purely genetic perspective, and excluding the strong association at the APOE locus, DLB is equally correlated to AD and PD.",

We collected X-ray absorption spectroscopy data on samples containing Abeta with Cu and Zn at different concentration ratios. We show that the order in which metals are added to the peptide solution matters and that, when Zn is added first, it prevents Cu from binding. On the contrary, when Cu is added first, it does not (completely) prevent Zn binding to Abeta peptides. Our analysis suggests that Cu and Zn ions are coordinated to different numbers of histidine residues depending on the [ion]:[peptide] concentration ratio.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular alpha-synuclein has been proposed as a crucial mechanism for induction of pathological aggregate formation in previously healthy cells. In vitro, extracellular alpha-synuclein is partially associated with exosomal vesicles. Recently, we have provided evidence that exosomal alpha-synuclein is present in the central nervous system in vivo. We hypothesized that exosomal alpha-synuclein species from patients with alpha-synuclein related neurodegeneration serve as carriers for interneuronal disease transmission. We isolated exosomes from cerebrospinal fluid from patients with Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, progressive supranuclear palsy as a non-alpha-synuclein related disorder that clinically overlaps with Parkinson's disease, and neurological controls. Cerebrospinal fluid exosome numbers, alpha-synuclein protein content of cerebrospinal fluid exosomes and their potential to induce oligomerization of alpha-synuclein were analysed. The quantification of cerebrospinal fluid exosomal alpha-synuclein showed distinct differences between patients with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. In addition, exosomal alpha-synuclein levels correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment in cross-sectional samples from patients with dementia with Lewy bodies. Importantly, cerebrospinal fluid exosomes derived from Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies induce oligomerization of alpha-synuclein in a reporter cell line in a dose-dependent manner. Our data suggest that cerebrospinal fluid exosomes from patients with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies contain a pathogenic species of alpha-synuclein, which could initiate oligomerization of soluble alpha-synuclein in target cells and confer disease pathology.",

    "title": "The domestic cat as a natural animal model of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most dominant neurodegenerative disorder that causes dementia, and no effective treatments are available. To study its pathogenesis and develop therapeutics, animal models representing its pathologies are needed. Although many animal species develop senile plaques (SP) composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta) proteins that are identical to those found in humans, none of them exhibit neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and subsequent neurodegeneration, which are integral parts of the pathology of AD. RESULTS: The present study shows that Abeta accumulation, NFT formation, and significant neuronal loss all emerge naturally in the hippocampi of aged domestic cats. The NFT that form in the cat brain are identical to those seen in human AD in terms of their spatial distribution, the cells they affect, and the tau isoforms that comprise them. Interestingly, aged cats do not develop mature argyrophilic SP, but instead accumulate intraneuronal Abeta oligomers in their hippocampal pyramidal cells, which might be due to the amino acid sequence of felid Abeta. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Abeta oligomers are more important than SP for NFT formation and the subsequent neurodegeneration. The domestic cat is a unique animal species that naturally replicates various AD pathologies, especially Abeta oligomer accumulation, NFT formation, and neuronal loss.",

Comprehensive understanding of SPIONs interactions with amyloid beta (Abeta) and other amyloidogenic proteins is essential for their clinical application. SPIONs could be delivered to the target tissue under the magnetic field, while they might be influenced by the applied field. In this work, we exhibit the effect of different SPIONs (magnetized or non-magnetized with different surface charges) on the kinetics of Abeta fibrillation in aqueous solution by the aid of ThT assay. The results showed that applying of magnetic field to the SPIONs influences on the Abeta fibrillation because of its effect on the size due to surface charge. It was found that under magnetic field and high concentrations of nanoparticles (SPIONs-PEG-NH2), the Abeta fibrillation process accelerates, while at lower concentrations the fibrillation is inhibited. Furthermore, the coating charge has a considerable role in fibrillation process and the positively charged SPIONs/magnetized, at lower particle concentrations, accelerate the fibrillation compared with the negatively charged or uncharged SPIONs. This hints that SPIONs with a positive charge have dual effects on the Abeta fibrillation process. They influence on the concentration of monomeric protein in solution and thereby the nucleation time. Also, SPIONs have an effect on binding during the protein conformation.",

Safflower yellow (SY) is one of traditional Chinese medicine extracted from safflower, which is suggested to have therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative disorders. However, whether SY can ameliorate impairment of learning and memory in AD model, and its causal mechanism are still unclear. Here, we applied different doses of SY intragastrically to Wistar rats injected with amyloid beta (1-42) for 1 month. By the Morris water maze test, we found that treatment of SY significantly attenuated amyloid beta (1-42)-induced impairment of memory in rats. Mechanistically, SY treatment increased the level of superoxidedismutase (SOD) and Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and decreased the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and acetylcholinesterase (T-CHE) in brain tissues of AD rats. Pathological analysis also showed that SY treatment inhibited the morphological alteration of neurons and tau hyperphosphorylation induced by amyloid beta (1-42)-injection in the cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, SY treatment inhibited CDK-5 and GSK-3 signaling pathways, which are upregulated in AD rats.

Abeta1-42 oligomers display a high degree of polymorphism, and several structurally different oligomers have been described. Amongst them, two types, recently classified as A+ and A-, have been shown to possess similar size but distinct toxic properties, as a consequence of their biophysical and structural differences. Here, we have investigated by means of single molecule tracking the oligomer mobility on the plasma membrane of living neuroblastoma cells and the interaction with the ganglioside GM1, a component of membrane rafts. We have found that A+ and A- oligomers display a similar lateral diffusion on the plasma membrane of living cells. However, only the toxic A+ oligomers appear to interact and alter the mobility of GM1. We have also studied the lateral diffusion of each kind of oligomers in cells depleted or enriched in GM1. We found that the content of GM1 influences the diffusion of both types of oligomer, although the effect of the increased levels of GM1 is higher for the A+ type.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between alcohol consumption and mortality in patients recently diagnosed with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). DESIGN: A post hoc analysis study based on a clinical trial population. SETTING: The data reported were collected as part of the Danish Alzheimer's Intervention Study (DAISY), a longitudinal multicentre randomised controlled study on the efficacy of psychosocial intervention in patients with mild AD across five county districts in Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: 321 patients with mild AD (Mini-Mental State Examination >= 20) were included. Data regarding current daily alcohol consumption were obtained from the patient's primary caregivers at inclusion. MAIN OUTCOME: All-cause mortality retrieved from The Danish Civil Registration System over a period of 36 months after baseline. RESULTS: Information about alcohol consumption was obtained from all 321 study participants: 8% were abstinent, 71% only had alcohol occasionally (1 or <1 unit/day), 17% had 2-3 units/day and 4% had more than 3 units/day. An analysis adjusted for a range of potential confounders demonstrated a reduced mortality for patients with moderate alcohol consumption (2-3 units/day): HR 0.23 (95% CI (0.08 to 0.69)) compared with patients who had 1 or <1 unit/day. Mortality was not significantly different in abstinent patients or in patients with an alcohol consumption of more than 3 units/day, compared with patients drinking 1 or <1 unit/day. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with mild AD, moderate alcohol consumption (2-3 units/day) was associated with a significantly lower mortality over a period of 36 months. Further studies are needed in this area. These may especially focus on the association between alcohol consumption and cognitive decline in patients with AD.",

    "abstract": "Both amyloid-beta (Abeta) and transition metal ions are shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), though the importance of their interactions remains unclear. Multifunctional molecules, which can target metal-free and metal-bound Abeta and modulate their reactivity (e.g., Abeta aggregation), have been developed as chemical tools to investigate their function in AD pathology; however, these compounds generally lack specificity or have undesirable chemical and biological properties, reducing their functionality. We have evaluated whether multiple polyphenolic glycosides and their esterified derivatives can serve as specific, multifunctional probes to better understand AD. The ability of these compounds to interact with metal ions and metal-free/-associated Abeta, and further control both metal-free and metal-induced Abeta aggregation was investigated through gel electrophoresis with Western blotting, transmission electron microscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and NMR spectroscopy. We also examined the cytotoxicity of the compounds and their ability to mitigate the toxicity induced by both metal-free and metal-bound Abeta. Of the polyphenols investigated, the natural product (Verbascoside) and its esterified derivative (VPP) regulate the aggregation and cytotoxicity of metal-free and/or metal-associated Abeta to different extents. Our studies indicate Verbascoside represents a promising structure for further multifunctional tool development against both metal-free Abeta and metal-Abeta.",

    "title": "Amyloid-beta dimers in the absence of plaque pathology impair learning and synaptic plasticity.",
    "abstract": "Despite amyloid plaques, consisting of insoluble, aggregated amyloid-beta peptides, being a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease, their significance has been challenged due to controversial findings regarding the correlation of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease with plaque load. The amyloid cascade hypothesis defines soluble amyloid-beta oligomers, consisting of multiple amyloid-beta monomers, as precursors of insoluble amyloid-beta plaques. Dissecting the biological effects of single amyloid-beta oligomers, for example of amyloid-beta dimers, an abundant amyloid-beta oligomer associated with clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease, has been difficult due to the inability to control the kinetics of amyloid-beta multimerization. For investigating the biological effects of amyloid-beta dimers, we stabilized amyloid-beta dimers by an intermolecular disulphide bridge via a cysteine mutation in the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta-S8C) of the amyloid precursor protein. This construct was expressed as a recombinant protein in cells and in a novel transgenic mouse, termed tgDimer mouse. This mouse formed constant levels of highly synaptotoxic soluble amyloid-beta dimers, but not monomers, amyloid-beta plaques or insoluble amyloid-beta during its lifespan. Accordingly, neither signs of neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation or cell death were observed. Nevertheless, these tgDimer mice did exhibit deficits in hippocampal long-term potentiation and age-related impairments in learning and memory, similar to what was observed in classical Alzheimer's disease mouse models. Although the amyloid-beta dimers were unable to initiate the formation of insoluble amyloid-beta aggregates in tgDimer mice, after crossbreeding tgDimer mice with the CRND8 mouse, an amyloid-beta plaque generating mouse model, Abeta-S8C dimers were sequestered into amyloid-beta plaques, suggesting that amyloid-beta plaques incorporate neurotoxic amyloid-beta dimers that by themselves are unable to self-assemble. Our results suggest that within the fine interplay between different amyloid-beta species, amyloid-beta dimer neurotoxic signalling, in the absence of amyloid-beta plaque pathology, may be involved in causing early deficits in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory that accompany Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "The APP Intracellular Domain Is Required for Normal Synaptic Morphology, Synaptic Plasticity, and Hippocampus-Dependent Behavior.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The amyloid precursor protein family (APP/APLPs) has essential roles for neuromuscular synapse development and for the formation and plasticity of synapses within the CNS. Despite this, it has remained unclear whether APP mediates its functions primarily as a cell surface adhesion and signaling molecule or via its numerous proteolytic cleavage products. To address these questions, we followed a genetic approach and used APPDeltaCT15 knockin mice lacking the last 15 amino acids of APP, including the highly conserved YENPTY protein interaction motif. To circumvent functional compensation by the closely related APLP2, these mice were bred to an APLP2-KO background to generate APPDeltaCT15-DM double mutants. These APPDeltaCT15-DM mice were partially viable and displayed defects in neuromuscular synapse morphology and function with impairments in the ability to sustain transmitter release that resulted in muscular weakness. In the CNS, we demonstrate pronounced synaptic deficits including impairments in LTP that were associated with deficits in spatial learning and memory. Thus, the APP-CT15 domain provides essential physiological functions, likely via recruitment of specific interactors. Together with the well-established role of APPsalpha for synaptic plasticity, this shows that multiple domains of APP, including the conserved C-terminus, mediate signals required for normal PNS and CNS physiology. In addition, we demonstrate that lack of the APP-CT15 domain strongly impairs Abeta generation in vivo, establishing the APP C-terminus as a target for Abeta-lowering strategies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline are early hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease. Thus, it is essential to elucidate the in vivo function(s) of APP at the synapse. At present, it is unknown whether APP family proteins function as cell surface receptors, or mainly via shedding of their secreted ectodomains, such as neurotrophic APPsalpha. Here, to dissect APP functional domains, we used APP mutant mice lacking the last 15 amino acids that were crossed onto an APLP2-KO background. These APPDeltaCT15-DM mice showed defects in neuromuscular morphology and function. Synaptic deficits in the CNS included impairments of synaptic plasticity, spatial learning, and memory. Collectively, this indicates that multiple APP domains, including the C-terminus, are required for normal nervous system function.",

    "abstract": "Importance: A reliable method of detecting Alzheimer disease (AD) in its prodromal state is needed for patient stratification in clinical trials or for personalizing existing or potential upcoming therapies. Current cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)- or imaging-based single biomarkers for AD offer reliable identification of patients with underlying AD but insufficient prediction of the rate of AD progression. Objective: To optimize prediction of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD dementia by combining information from diverse patient variables. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) enrolled 928 patients with MCI at baseline and 249 selected variables available in the ADNI data set. Variables included clinical and demographic data, cognitive scores, magnetic resonance imaging-based brain volumetric data, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog (TOMM40) genotypes, and analyte levels measured in the CSF and plasma. Data were collected in July 2012 and analyzed from July 1, 2012, to June 1, 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures: Progression from MCI to AD within 1 to 6 years. To determine whether combinations of markers could predict progression from MCI to AD within 1 to 6 years, the elastic net algorithm was used in an iterative resampling of a training- and test-based variable selection and modeling approach. Results: Among the 928 patients with MCI in the ADNI database, 94 had 224 of the required variables available for the modeling. The results showed the contributions of age, Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes composite test score, hippocampal volume, and multiple plasma and CSF factors in modeling progression to AD. A combination of apolipoprotein A-II and cortisol levels in plasma and fibroblast growth factor 4, heart-type fatty acid binding protein, calcitonin, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 3 (TRAIL-R3) in CSF allowed for reliable prediction of disease status 3 years from the time of sample collection (80% classification accuracy, 88% sensitivity, and 70% specificity). Conclusions and Relevance: These study findings suggest that a combination of markers measured in plasma and CSF, distinct from beta-amyloid and tau, could prove useful in predicting midterm progression from MCI to AD dementia. Such a large-scale, multivariable-based analytical approach could be applied to other similar large data sets involving AD and beyond.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Radioligand imaging is a powerful in vivo method to assess the molecular basis of Alzheimer's Disease. We therefore aimed to visualize the pathological deposition of fibrillar amyloid-beta and neuronal dysfunction in aged double transgenic mice. METHODS: Using non-invasive positron emission tomography (PET) we assessed brain glucose utilization with [(18)F]FDG and fibrillar amyloidosis with [(11)C]PiB and [(18)F]AV45 in 12 month old APPPS1-21 (n = 10) mice and their age-matched wild-type controls (n = 15). PET scans were analyzed with statistical parametric mapping (SPM) to detect significant differences in tracer uptake between genotypes. After imaging, mice were sacrificed and ex vivo measures of amyloid-beta burden with immunohistochemistry as well as glucose utilization with [(14)C]-2DG autoradiography were obtained as gold standards. RESULTS: Voxel-wise SPM analysis revealed significantly decreased [(18)F]FDG uptake in aged APPPS1-21 mice in comparison to WT with the thalamus (96.96 %, maxT = 3.35) and striatum (61.21 %, maxT = 3.29) demonstrating the most widespread reductions at the threshold of p < 0.01. [(11)C]PiB binding was significantly increased in APPPS1-21 mice, most notably in the hippocampus (87.84 %, maxT = 7.15) and cortex (69.08 %, maxT = 7.95), as detected by SPM voxel-wise analysis at the threshold of p < 0.01. Using the same threshold [(18)F]AV45 uptake was comparably lower with less significant differences. Compared to their respective ex vivo equivalents [(18)F]FDG demonstrated significant positive correlation to [(14)C]2-DG autoradiography (r = 0.67, p <0.0001) while [(11)C]PiB and [(18)F]AV45 binding did not correlate to ex vivo immunohistochemistry for amyloid-beta (r = 0.25, p = 0.07 and r = 0.17, p = 0.26 respectively). Lastly no correlation was observed between regions of high amyloid burden and those with decreased glucose utilization (r = 0.001, p = 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support that fibrillar amyloid-beta deposition and reduced glucose utilization can be visualized and quantified with in vivo muPET imaging in aged APPPS1-21 mice. Therefore, the combined use of [(18)F]FDG and amyloid muPET imaging can shed light on the underlying relationship between fibrillar amyloid-beta pathology and neuronal dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease-related phenotypes in mice can be rescued by blockade of either cellular prion protein or metabotropic glutamate receptor 5. We sought genetic and biochemical evidence that these proteins function cooperatively as an obligate complex in the brain. We show that cellular prion protein associates via transmembrane metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 with the intracellular protein mediators Homer1b/c, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and the Alzheimer's disease risk gene product protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta. Coupling of cellular prion protein to these intracellular proteins is modified by soluble amyloid-beta oligomers, by mouse brain Alzheimer's disease transgenes or by human Alzheimer's disease pathology. Amyloid-beta oligomer-triggered phosphorylation of intracellular protein mediators and impairment of synaptic plasticity in vitro requires Prnp-Grm5 genetic interaction, being absent in transheterozygous loss-of-function, but present in either single heterozygote. Importantly, genetic coupling between Prnp and Grm5 is also responsible for signalling, for survival and for synapse loss in Alzheimer's disease transgenic model mice. Thus, the interaction between metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 and cellular prion protein has a central role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and the complex is a potential target for disease-modifying intervention.",

    "title": "Triptolide attenuated injury via inhibiting oxidative stress in Amyloid-Beta25-35-treated differentiated PC12 cells.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recently, an abnormal deposition of Amyloid-Beta (Abeta) was considered the primary cause of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). And how to inhibit the cytotoxicity is considered an important target for the treatment of AD. Triptolide (TP), a purified diterpenoid from the herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook.f. (TWHF), has potential neuroprotective effects pertinent to disease of the nervous system. However, whether triptolide and its specific mechanisms have protective functions in differentiated PC12 cells treated with Abeta25-35 remain unclear. AIMS: The purpose is to investigate the protective functions of triptolide in Abeta25-35-stimulated differentiated PC12 cells. MAIN METHODS: In the study, we use 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, flow cytometry assay, immunohistochemical staining and Western blot to observe the effects of triptolide on cytotoxicity induced by Abeta25-35 and its mechanism of oxidative stress. KEY FINDINGS: The result of MTT and LDH assay indicates that triptolide protected PC12 cells against Abeta25-35-induced cytotoxicity. The flow cytometry assay shows that triptolide attenuated Abeta25-35-induced apoptosis in differentiated PC12 cells. Meanwhile, the results give a clear indication that triptolide could downregulate generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) induced by Abeta25-35. The apoptotic process triggered by triptolide involved the up-regulation of the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that triptolide may serve as an important role in the inhibition of the cell apoptosis induced by Abeta and the decreased oxidative stress is a key mechanism in the protective effect of triptolide in AD.",

We examined a total of 123 elderly participants without dementia and free of other neurological disorders or pathologies who at autopsy were classified as Braak NFT stages of I-V. We found that women were significantly more likely to have a high Braak score. Significant associations were found between high Braak scores and entorhinal cortex amyloid load, combined hippocampal and entorhinal cortex amyloid loads with perceptual speed in the low Braak group after adjusting for age, gender and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 status. Elderly with preserved cognitive function show a wide range of Braak scores and plaque pathology similar to that seen in prodromal and frank Alzheimer's disease at death.

    "abstract": "The recombinant C-terminal domain of tetanus toxin (Hc-TeTx) is a new non-toxic peptide of the tetanus toxin that exerts a protective action against glutamate excitotoxicity in motoneurons. Moreover, its efficacy as a neuroprotective agent has been demonstrated in several animal models of neurodegeneration. The eleven amino acids in the beta amyloid peptide (Abeta25-35) mimic the toxic effects of the full beta amyloid peptide (Abeta1-42), causing the impairment of the cholinergic system in the medial septum (MS) which, in turn, alters the septo-hippocampal pathway and leads to learning and memory impairments. The aim of this study was to examine the neuroprotective effects of the Hc-TeTx fragment against cholinotoxicity. The Hc-TeTx fragment (100 ng) was injected into the rats intercranially, with the Abeta(25-35) (2 mug) then injected into their MS. The animals were tested for spatial learning and memory in the eight-arm radial maze. The brains were removed to assess cholinergic markers, such as choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and to explore neurodegeneration in the MS and hippocampus, using amino-cupric silver and H&E staining. Finally, capase-3, a marker of apoptosis, was examined in the MS. Our results clearly demonstrate that the application of Hc-TeTx prevents the loss of cholinergic markers (ChAT and AChE), the activation of capase-3, and neurodegeneration in the MS and the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus. All these improvements were reflected in spatial learning and memory performance, and were significantly higher compared with animals treated with Abeta(25-35). Interestingly, the single administration of Hc-TeTx into the MS modified the ChAT and AChE expression that affect cognitive processes, without inducing neurodegeneration or an increase in capase-3 expression in the MS and hippocampus. In summary, our findings suggest that the recombinant Hc-TeTx fragment offers effective protection for the septo-hippocampal pathway, given that it reduces the neurodegeneration caused by Abeta(25-35) and improves learning and memory processes.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid (senile) plaques, one of the two pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD), are associated with dystrophic neurites and glial responses, both astrocytic and microglial. Although plaque burden remains relatively stable through the clinical course of AD, whether these features of local plaque toxicity continue to worsen over the course of the disease is unclear. We performed an unbiased plaque-centered quantification of SMI312(+) dystrophic neurites, GFAP(+) reactive astrocytes, and IBA1(+) and CD68(+) activated microglia in randomly selected dense-core (Thioflavin-S(+)) plaques from the temporal neocortex of 40 AD subjects with a symptom duration ranging from 4 to 20 years, and nine nondemented control subjects with dense-core plaques. Dystrophic neurites (Kendall tau = 0.34, P = 0.001), reactive astrocytes (Kendall tau = 0.30, P = 0.003), and CD68(+) (Kendall tau = 0.48, P < 0.0001), but not IBA1 microglia (Kendall tau = 0.045, P = 0.655), exhibited a significant positive correlation with symptom duration. When excluding control subjects, only the positive association between CD68(+) microglia and symptom duration remained significant (Kendall tau = 0.39, P = 0.0003). The presence of the APOEepsilon4 allele did not affect these results. We conclude that plaques exert an increasing toxicity in the surrounding neuropil over the clinical course of AD, thereby potentially contributing to cognitive decline.",

Pluripotent stem cells, including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), are promising materials for creating cellular models of such diseases. In the present study, we established cellular models of AD in hESCs that overexpressed the mutant Presenilin 1 (PS1) gene with the use of a site-specific gene integration system. The overexpression of PS1 did not affect the undifferentiated status or the neural differentiation ability of the hESCs. We found increases in the ratios of amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42)/Abeta40 and Abeta43/Abeta40. Furthermore, synaptic dysfunction was observed in a cellular model of AD that overexpressed mutant PS1. These results suggest that the AD phenotypes, in particular, the electrophysiological abnormality of the synapses in our AD models might be useful for AD research and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Many single-transmembrane proteins are sequentially cleaved by ectodomain-shedding alpha-secretases and the gamma-secretase complex, a process called regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). These cleavages are thought to be spatially and temporally separate. In contrast, we provide evidence for a hitherto unrecognized multiprotease complex containing both alpha- and gamma-secretase. ADAM10 (A10), the principal neuronal alpha-secretase, interacted and cofractionated with gamma-secretase endogenously in cells and mouse brain. A10 immunoprecipitation yielded gamma-secretase proteolytic activity and vice versa. In agreement, superresolution microscopy showed that portions of A10 and gamma-secretase colocalize. Moreover, multiple gamma-secretase inhibitors significantly increased alpha-secretase processing (r = -0.86) and decreased beta-secretase processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein. Select members of the tetraspanin web were important both in the association between A10 and gamma-secretase and the gamma   alpha feedback mechanism. Portions of endogenous BACE1 coimmunoprecipitated with gamma-secretase but not A10, suggesting that beta- and alpha-secretases can form distinct complexes with gamma-secretase. Thus, cells possess large multiprotease complexes capable of sequentially and efficiently processing transmembrane substrates through a spatially coordinated RIP mechanism.",

Pyroglutamate formation increases the rate of Abeta oligomerization and alters the interactions of Abeta with Cu(2+) and lipids; however, a link between these properties and the toxicity of pE-Abeta peptides has not been established. We report here that Abeta3pE-42 has an enhanced capacity to cause lipid peroxidation in primary cortical mouse neurons compared with the full-length isoform (Abeta(1-42)). In contrast, Abeta(1-42) caused a significant elevation in cytosolic reactive oxygen species, whereas Abeta3pE-42 did not. We also report that Abeta3pE-42 preferentially associates with neuronal membranes and triggers Ca(2+) influx that can be partially blocked by the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801. Abeta3pE-42 further caused a loss of plasma membrane integrity and remained bound to neurons at significantly higher levels than Abeta(1-42) over extended incubations. Pyroglutamate formation was additionally found to increase the relative efficiency of Abeta-dityrosine oligomer formation mediated by copper-redox cycling.",

The mechanism by which gamma-secretase selectively recognizes and recruits ectodomain-shed substrates for catalysis remains unclear. In contrast to previous reports that substrate is actively recruited for catalysis when its remaining short ectodomain interacts with the nicastrin component of gamma-secretase, we find that substrate ectodomain is entirely dispensable for cleavage. Instead, gamma-secretase-substrate binding is driven by an apparent tight-binding interaction derived from substrate transmembrane domain, a mechanism in stark contrast to rhomboid--another family of intramembrane-cleaving proteases. Disruption of the nicastrin fold allows for more efficient cleavage of substrates retaining longer ectodomains, indicating that nicastrin actively excludes larger substrates through steric hindrance, thus serving as a molecular gatekeeper for substrate binding and catalysis.",

    "abstract": "Oligomeric assemblies are postulated to be proximate neurotoxic species in human diseases associated with aberrant protein aggregation. Their heterogeneous and transient nature makes their structural characterization difficult. Size distributions of oligomers of several amyloidogenic proteins, including amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD), have been previously characterized in vitro by photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Due to non-physiological conditions associated with the PICUP chemistry, Abeta oligomers cross-linked by PICUP may not be representative of in vivo conditions. Here, we examine an alternative Copper and Hydrogen peroxide Induced Cross-linking of Unmodified Proteins (CHICUP), which utilizes naturally occurring divalent copper ions and hydrogen peroxide and does not require photo activation. Our results demonstrate that CHICUP and PICUP applied to the two predominant Abeta alloforms, Abeta40 and Abeta42, result in similar oligomer size distributions. Thioflavin T fluorescence data and atomic force microscopy images demonstrate that both CHICUP and PICUP stabilize Abeta oligomers and attenuate fibril formation. Relative to noncross-linked peptides, CHICUP-treated Abeta40 and Abeta42 cause prolonged disruption to biomimetic lipid vesicles. CHICUP-stabilized Abeta oligomers link the amyloid cascade, metal, and oxidative stress hypotheses of AD into a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of AD pathology. Because copper and hydrogen peroxide are elevated in the AD brain, CHICUP-stabilized Abeta oligomers are biologically relevant and should be further explored as a new therapeutic target.",

    "title": "Vascular cognitive impairment: Modeling a critical neurologic disease in vitro and in vivo.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is a complex form of dementia, combining aspects of vascular disease and other forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. VCID encompasses a wide spectrum of cerebrovascular-driven cognitive impairment, from mild cognitive impairment to fully developed dementia. This disease state is further complicated by metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension, and lifestyle factors, like obesity and high fat diets. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This manuscript is meant to both define VCID and review the in vitro and in vivo models of the disease state. This includes in vitro models of the neurovascular unit, models of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, animals with NOTCH3 mutations as a model of small vessel disease, large animals with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and animal models of mixed dementia. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Synthetic microvessels are a promising technique to study the neurovascular unit and canines, despite the cost, are an excellent model to study CAA. While there are several good models of individual aspects of VCID, the heterogeneity of the disease states prevents them from being a model of all aspects of the disease. Therefore, VCID needs to be further defined into disease states that exist within this umbrella term. This includes specific guidelines for stroke counts and stroke locations and further categorization of overlapping cerebrovascular and AD pathologies that contribute to dementia. This will allow for better models and a more thorough understanding of how vascular disease contributes to dementia. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: VCID is the second most common form of dementia and is expected to increase in coming years. The heterogeneity of VCID makes it difficult to study, but without better definitions and models, VCID presents a major public health problem for our aging population.

TSPO ligands have been investigated as therapeutic agents that promote neuroprotective effects in experimental models of brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to identify the neuroprotective effects of 4'-chlorodiazepam (4'-CD), a ligand of TSPO, against amyloid-beta (Abeta) in SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells and its mechanisms of action. Abeta decreased the viability of SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells, while 4'-CD had a neuroprotective effect at the doses of 1nM and 10nM. The neuroprotective effects of 4'-CD against Abeta were associated with the inhibition of Abeta-induced upregulation of Bax and downregulation of survivin. In summary, our findings indicate that 4'-CD is neuroprotective against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity by a mechanism that may involve the regulation of Bax and survivin expression.",

    "title": "Propagation of Ass pathology: hypotheses, discoveries, and yet unresolved questions from experimental and human brain studies.",
    "abstract": "In brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Abeta peptides accumulate in parenchyma and, almost invariably, also in the vascular walls. Although Abeta aggregation is, by definition, present in AD, its impact is only incompletely understood. It occurs in a stereotypical spatiotemporal distribution within neuronal networks in the course of the disease. This suggests a role for synaptic connections in propagating Abeta pathology, and possibly of axonal transport in an antero- or retrograde way-although, there is also evidence for passive, extracellular diffusion. Striking, in AD, is the conjunction of tau and Abeta pathology. Tau pathology in the cell body of neurons precedes Abeta deposition in their synaptic endings in several circuits such as the entorhino-dentate, cortico-striatal or subiculo-mammillary connections. However, genetic evidence suggests that Abeta accumulation is the first step in AD pathogenesis. To model the complexity and consequences of Abeta aggregation in vivo, various transgenic (tg) rodents have been generated. In rodents tg for the human Abeta precursor protein, focal injections of preformed Abeta aggregates can induce Abeta deposits in the vicinity of the injection site, and over time in more distant regions of the brain. This suggests that Abeta shares with alpha-synuclein, tau and other proteins the property to misfold and aggregate homotypic molecules. We propose to group those proteins under the term \"propagons\". Propagons may lack the infectivity of prions. We review findings from neuropathological examinations of human brains in different stages of AD and from studies in rodent models of Abeta aggregation and discuss putative mechanisms underlying the initiation and spread of Abeta pathology.",

    "abstract": "Besides its crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, the knowledge of amyloid precursor protein (APP) physiologic functions remains surprisingly scarce. Here, we show that APP regulates the transcription of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). APP-dependent regulation of GDNF expression affects muscle strength, muscular trophy, and both neuronal and muscular differentiation fundamental for neuromuscular junction (NMJ) maturation in vivo In a nerve-muscle coculture model set up to modelize NMJ formation in vitro, silencing of muscular APP induces a 30% decrease in secreted GDNF levels and a 40% decrease in the total number of NMJs together with a significant reduction in the density of acetylcholine vesicles at the presynaptic site and in neuronal maturation. These defects are rescued by GDNF expression in muscle cells in the conditions where muscular APP has been previously silenced. Expression of GDNF in muscles of amyloid precursor protein null mice corrected the aberrant synaptic morphology of NMJs. Our findings highlight for the first time that APP-dependent GDNF expression drives the process of NMJ formation, providing new insights into the link between APP gene regulatory network and physiologic functions.-Stanga, S., Zanou, N., Audouard, E., Tasiaux, B., Contino, S., Vandermeulen, G., Rene, F., Loeffler, J.-P., Clotman, F., Gailly, P., Dewachter, I., Octave, J.-N., Kienlen-Campard, P.

    "title": "Structural insights into mechanisms for inhibiting amyloid beta42 aggregation by non-catechol-type flavonoids.",
    "abstract": "The prevention of 42-mer amyloid beta-protein (Abeta42) aggregation is promising for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We previously described the site-specific inhibitory mechanism for Abeta42 aggregation by a catechol-type flavonoid, (+)-taxifolin, targeting Lys16,28 after its autoxidation. In contrast, non-catechol-type flavonoids (morin, datiscetin, and kaempferol) inhibited Abeta42 aggregation without targeting Lys16,28 with almost similar potencies to that of (+)-taxifolin. We herein provided structural insights into their mechanisms for inhibiting Abeta42 aggregation. Physicochemical analyses revealed that their inhibition did not require autoxidation. The (1)H-(15)N SOFAST-HMQC NMR of Abeta42 in the presence of morin and datiscetin revealed the significant perturbation of chemical shifts of His13,14 and Gln15, which were close to the intermolecular beta-sheet region, Gln15-Ala21. His13,14 also played a role in radical formation at Tyr10, thereby inducing the oxidation of Met35, which has been implicated in Abeta42 aggregation. These results suggest the direct interaction of morin and datiscetin with the Abeta42 monomer. Although only kaempferol was oxidatively-degraded during incubation, its degradation products as well as kaempferol itself suppressed Abeta42 aggregation. However, neither kaempferol nor its decomposed products perturbed the chemical shifts of the Abeta42 monomer. Aggregation experiments using 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol-treated Abeta42 demonstrated that kaempferol and its degradation products inhibited the elongation rather than nucleation phase, implying that they interacted with small aggregates of Abeta42, but not with the monomer. In contrast, morin and datiscetin inhibited both phases. The position and number of hydroxyl groups on the B-ring of non-catechol-type flavonoids could be important for their inhibitory potencies and mechanisms against Abeta42 aggregation.",

    "title": "Neurogranin restores amyloid beta-mediated synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation deficits.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) is widely considered one of the early causes of cognitive deficits observed in Alzheimer's disease. Many of the deficits caused by Abeta are attributed to its disruption of synaptic function represented by its blockade of long-term potentiation (LTP) and its induction of synaptic depression. Identifying pathways that reverse these synaptic deficits may open the door to new therapeutic targets. In this study, we explored the possibility that Neurogranin (Ng)-a postsynaptic calmodulin (CaM) targeting protein that enhances synaptic function-may rescue Abeta-mediated deficits in synaptic function. Our results show that Ng is able to reverse synaptic depression and LTP deficits induced by Abeta. Furthermore, Ng's restoration of synaptic transmission is through the insertion of GluA1-containing alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid glutamate receptors (AMPARs). These restorative effects of Ng are dependent on the interaction of Ng and CaM and CaM-dependent activation of CaMKII. Overall, this study identifies a novel mechanism to rescue synaptic deficits induced by Abeta oligomers. It also suggests Ng and CaM signaling as potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease as well as important tools to further explore the pathophysiology underlying the disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases in modern society because of insurmountable difficulties in early diagnosis and lack of therapeutic treatments. AD pathogenesis is tightly linked to the abnormal accumulation and aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta), seemingly the main causative factor of AD; however, intensive research on Abeta has not yet explained the complexity of AD pathogenesis. Consequently, the role of other supportive partners of Abeta have been elucidated and evaluated in the etiology of AD, and their potential molecular mechanisms have emerged as possible therapeutic targets. In this review, we compile information regarding Abeta-interacting partners in normal conditions and AD pathology, and analyze their etiological roles in diverse areas. Furthermore, we integrate this information into suggestions for probable clinical applications for AD diagnosis and therapeutics. We include Abeta-interacting partners localized to the cell surface and intracellular and extracellular compartments of different cell types ranging from the central nervous system to peripheral regions. Additionally, we expand the range of Abeta-interacting partners by including not only proteins, but also inorganic substances like metals, expecting that one of these partners may yield a critical breakthrough in the field of AD diagnostics and therapeutic drug development.",

    "abstract": "Alterations of the tightly interwoven neuron/astrocyte interactions are frequent traits of aging, but also favor neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD). These alterations reflect impairments of the innate responses to inflammation-related processes, such as beta-amyloid (Abeta) burdening. Multidisciplinary studies, spanning from the tissue to the molecular level, are needed to assess how neuron/astrocyte interactions are influenced by aging. Our study addressed this requirement by joining fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy/phasor multiphoton analysis with confocal microscopy, implemented with a novel method to separate spectrally overlapped immunofluorescence and Abeta autofluorescence. By comparing data from young control rats, chronically inflamed rats, and old rats, we identified age-specific alterations of neuron/astrocyte interactions in the hippocampus. We found a correlation between Abeta aggregation (+300 and +800% of aggregated Abeta peptide in chronically inflamed and oldvs.control rats, respectively) and fragmentation (clasmatodendrosis) of astrocyte projections (APJs) (+250 and +1300% of APJ fragments in chronically inflamed and oldvs.control rats, respectively). Clasmatodendrosis, in aged rats, associates with impairment of astrocyte-mediated Abeta clearance (-45% of Abeta deposits on APJs, and +33% of Abeta deposits on neurons in oldvs.chronically inflamed rats). Furthermore, APJ fragments colocalize with Abeta deposits and are involved in novel Abeta-mediated adhesions between neurons. These data define the effects of Abeta deposition on astrocyte/neuron interactions as a key topic in AD biology.-Mercatelli, R., Lana, D., Bucciantini, M., Giovannini, M.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Three (18)F-labeled radiopharmaceuticals have been Food and Drug Administration-approved for the identification of cortical amyloidosis in clinical settings. Although there has been strong debate among professionals as to the ethical and social consequences of disclosing such information, increasing numbers of participants are being recruited into secondary prevention trials for which they are likely to, and/or desire to, receive their positron emission tomography (PET) imaging results. METHODS: Healthy older adults (n = 63, mean age = 62 years) enrolled in a preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers trial, and 11 requested disclosure of PET amyloid imaging results to their treating neurologist, per institutional review board-approved study protocol. These individuals completed a follow-up psychoeducational program and structured interviews to assess impact of disclosure on several key psychological factors. RESULTS: Four of 11 subjects demonstrated increased amyloid aggregation and reported that they were not surprised, particularly given their family histories and subjective memory concerns. All indicated that they had shared this information with pertinent significant others; they were satisfied with their level of social support, and the imaging results had motivated them to change their lifestyle by exercising more, changing their diet, and planning ahead. Amyloid-positive participants showed little change in levels of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, subjective sense of memory impairment, or on measures of intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal, and reported risk of self-harm. DISCUSSION: Disclosure of PET amyloid status did not significantly impact mood, subjective sense of memory impairment, or perceived risk of developing AD; nor was this associated with significant emotional impact, irrespective of actual amyloid burden status. Those subjects with increased amyloid burden were more likely than those without significant amyloidosis to make positive changes to their lifestyle (e.g., engaging in more exercise and changing their diet).",

This study was performed between 2008 to 2013 and comprised of 62 patients, of which 38 were male (61.3%) and 24 female (38.7%). All patients were operated on due to hip osteoarthritis using total hip arthroplasty with the metaphyseal prosthesis Proxima. The age of patients included into the study ranged from 23 years to 62 years with the mean age of 46 years. The authors paid close attention to the \"pros and cons\" of surgical techniques and assessed clinical and radiological results in both the short and long-term observation periods. The clinical evaluation was based on the Harris Hip Score and radiological assessment of fixation of the acetabular cup of the endoprosthesis was based on Pradhan's criteria. The endoprosthesis Proxima stem was positioned using the manufacturer's recommended method, evaluating the direction, scope and duration of the displacement in the marrow cavity of the proximal stump of the femur. According to the authors' analysis, the surgery gives good functional and radiological results both in the short- and long-term observation periods. The effectiveness depends on precise qualification for surgery, proper surgical techniques and specific anatomical conditions of the proximal femur stump. The most common reasons for primary and secondary dislocations of the metaphyseal endoprosthesis Proxima stem occur during the first three months post surgery. This is due to incorrect surgical techniques, which disregard the importance of specific anatomical conditions of the proximal femoral stump, which affects Proxima implantation, and cause deviations towards a varus or valgus orientation.",

This study investigates the longitudinal evolution of amyloid topographies in cognitively normal older adults who had normal (N = 131) or abnormal (N = 26) PiB scans at baseline. At 3 years follow-up, 16 participants with a previously normal PiB scan had conversion to PiB scans consistent with preclinical AD. We investigated the multivariate relationship (canonical correlation) between baseline and follow-up PiB topographies. Furthermore, we used penalized regression to investigate the added information derived from PiB topography compared to summary measures. PiB accumulation can be local, that is, a topography predicting the same topography in the future, and/or distributed, that is, one topography predicting another. Both local and distributed PiB accumulation was associated with conversion of PiB status. Additionally, elements of the multivariate topography, and not the commonly used summary scalar, correlated with future PiB changes. Consideration of the entire multivariate PiB topography provides additional information regarding the development of amyloid-beta pathology in very early preclinical AD.",

    "abstract": "AIM: The aim of this study was to identify and assess the degree and clinical course of the main health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) issues in patients after a distal radius fracture (DRF). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were eligible if they were between 18-80 years and were within 1-3 days after a non-comminuted DRF. All patients filled out the Polish version of the IOF QLQ, the SF-36 and a demographic questionnaire. Assessment points were set as soon as possible after the fracture, 7 days, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 after the fracture. Standard statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: During the 16 month recruitment period a total of 71 patients (55 women - 77.5%), with a mean age of 64.1 +- 12.4 years, were included in the study group. All patients suffered from Colles type fractures. Attrition to follow-up was acceptable. At baseline, basing on the IOF QLQ scale scores, DRF patients had the most significant problems with physical function (82.8/100; with 100 representing the worst possible HRQoL), and general health (78.1/100). Basing on SF-36 scale scores patients most significant problems were associated with role limitations due to physical health problems (15.1/100; with 100 representing the best possible HRQoL), and bodily pain (39.5/100). CONCLUSIONS: Concluding, this study shows that the main issues with which patients with and extra-articular DRF struggle the most are pain of the fractured extremity and physical dysfunction. These symptoms are most pronounced in the early post-injury period, and in the majority of patients steadily decrease over a period of six months.",

    "abstract": "During the last twenty years, molecular genetic investigations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have significantly broadened our knowledge of basic mechanisms of this disorder. However, still no unambiguous concept on the molecular bases of AD pathogenesis has been elaborated, which significantly impedes the development of AD therapy. In this review, we analyze issues concerning processes of generation of two proteins (beta-amyloid peptide and Tau-protein) in the cell, which are believed to play the key role in AD genesis. Until recently, these agents were considered independently of each other, but in light of the latest studies, it becomes clear that it is necessary to study their interaction and combined effects. Studies of mechanisms of toxic action of these endogenous compounds, beginning from their interaction with known receptors of main neurotransmitters to specific peculiarities of functioning of signal intracellular pathways upon development of this pathology, open the way to development of new pharmaceutical substances directed concurrently on key mechanisms of interaction of toxic proteins inside the cell and on the pathways of their propagation in the extracellular space.",

    "abstract": "Evidence accumulates suggesting a complex interplay between neurodegenerative processes and serotonergic neurotransmission. We have previously reported an overexpression of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors (5-HT(1A)R) after intrahippocampal injections of amyloid-beta 1-40 (Abeta40) fibrils in rats. This serotonergic reactivity paralleled results from clinical positron emission tomography studies with [(18)F]MPPF revealing an overexpression of 5-HT(1A)R in the hippocampus of patients with mild cognitive impairment. Because Abeta40 and Abeta42 isoforms are found in amyloid plaques, we tested in this study the hypothesis of a peptide- and region-specific 5-HT(1A)R reactivity by injecting them, separately, into the hippocampus or striatum of rats. [(18)F]MPPF in vitro autoradiography revealed that Abeta40 fibrils, but not Abeta42, were triggering an overexpression of 5-HT(1A)R in the hippocampus and striatum of rat brains after 7 days. Immunohistochemical approaches targeting neuronal precursor cells, mature neurons, and astrocytes showed that Abeta42 fibrils caused more pathophysiological damages than Abeta40 fibrils. The mechanisms of Abeta40 fibrils-induced 5-HT(1A)R expression remains unknown, but hypotheses including neurogenesis, glial expression, and axonal sprouting are discussed.",

This study tested whether brain amyloid-beta deposition, measured in vivo with (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB), was associated with parental dementia and/or younger parental AO. Detailed FH and positron emission tomography (PiB) data were acquired in 147 nondemented aging individuals (mean age 75 +- 8). No participant had both positive maternal and paternal FH. A series of analyses revealed that those with maternal, but not paternal, FH had greater levels of PiB retention in a global cortical region than those without FH. PiB retention in maternal FH was not significantly greater than paternal FH. Younger maternal dementia AO was related to greater PiB retention in offspring, whereas younger paternal dementia AO was not. Overall, results suggest that not only is amyloid-beta burden greater in individuals with maternal FH, but also that the burden is greater in association with younger maternal AO.",

Cumulative evidence suggests that apolipoproteins, complement system, and transthyretin are involved in AD pathogenesis by sequestration of amyloid beta. However, there is no clinical study to assess the utility of \"sequester proteins\" in risk assessment and/or diagnosis of MCI and AD. METHODS: Serum levels of sequester proteins and their clinical potential in cognitive decline assessment were analyzed by longitudinal and cross-sectional studies using independent cohorts and were confirmed by a prospective study. RESULTS: A combination of apolipoprotein A1, complement C3, and transthyretin achieved an area under the curve of 0.89 (sensitivity 91% and specificity 80%) in MCI versus healthy controls and also discriminated individuals with mild cognitive decline from healthy controls. DISCUSSION: A set of sequester proteins could be blood-based biomarkers for assessment of early stages of cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance is known to be a risk factor for cognitive impairment, most likely linked to insulin signaling, microglia overactivation, and beta amyloid (Abeta) deposition in the brain. Exenatide, a long lasting glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, enhances insulin signaling and shows neuroprotective properties. Pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferated-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, was previously reported to enhance cognition through its effect on Abeta accumulation and clearance. In the present study, insulin resistance was induced in male rats by drinking fructose for 12 weeks. The effect of monotherapy with pioglitazone (10 mg kg(-1)) and exenatide or their combination on memory dysfunction was determined and some of the probable underlying mechanisms were studied. The current results confirmed that (1) feeding male rats with fructose syrup for 12 weeks resulted in a decline of learning and memory registered in eight-arm radial maze test; (2) treatment with pioglitazone or exenatide enhanced cognition, reduced hippocampal neurodegeneration, and reduced hippocampal microglia expression and beta amyloid oligomer deposition in a manner that is equal to monotherapies. These results may give promise for the use of pioglitazone or exenatide for ameliorating the learning and memory deficits associated with insulin resistance in clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "Cyclodextrins are used increasingly in pharmacotherapy. Experimental and clinical data suggest that cyclodextrins can be used not only as excipients for marketed drugs, but also as active pharmaceutical ingredients to treat neurological diseases including Niemann-Pick type C disease. Disruption of metal and cholesterol homeostasis, protein misfolding, and aggregation are recognized among the major pathological features in triggering neurodegenerative disorders, and therefore it is becoming more and more evident that the next generation of therapies should have multiple functions to combat the multifactorial nature of diseases. A novel class of compounds obtained by conjugating 8-hydroxyquinoline with cyclodextrin has been proposed to combine antioxidant activity, chelating, antiaggregant, and inclusion ability into one compound designed for metal-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, the synthesis and characterization of the new compound 3A -deoxy-3A -[(8-hydroxyquinolyl)-2-methylamino]-2A (S),3A (R)-beta-cyclodextrin is reported. Moreover, the interaction of copper-Abeta and zinc-Abeta amyloid with this class of cyclodextrin conjugates was investigated for the first time. New information about the effects of different modified chelating cyclodextrins may be important for further development of drugs against neurodegenerative disorders.",
