    "abstract": "Since the success of combined antiretroviral therapy, HIV-1-infected individuals are now living much longer. This increased life expectancy is accompanied by a higher prevalence of HIV-1 associated neurocognitive disorders. Rising too is the incidence in these patients of pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease such as increased deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta). Although neurons are major sources of Abeta in the brain, astrocytes are the most numerous glial cells, therefore, even a small level of astrocytic Abeta metabolism could make a significant contribution to brain pathology. Neprilysin (NEP) is a decisive/crucial regulator of Abeta levels. We evaluated the effects of HIV-1 on Abeta deposition and the expression and activity of NEP in primary human astrocytes. Specifically, no differences in intracellular amyloid deposits were found between infected and control cells. However, primary cultures of infected astrocytes showed more extracellular Abeta levels compared to controls. This was accompanied by reduced expression of NEP and to a significant decrease in its activity. These results indicate that the presence of HIV-1 in the brain could contribute to the increase in the total burden of cerebral Abeta.",

    "abstract": "Microglia are instrumental for recognition and elimination of amyloid beta1-42 oligomers (AbetaOs), but the long-term consequences of AbetaO-induced inflammatory changes in the brain are unclear. Here, we explored microglial responses and transciptome-level inflammatory signatures in the rat hippocampus after chronic AbetaO challenge. Middle-aged Long Evans rats received intracerebroventricular infusion of AbetaO or vehicle for 4 weeks, followed by treatment with artificial CSF or MCC950 for the subsequent 4 weeks. AbetaO infusion evoked a sustained inflammatory response including activation of NF-kappaB, triggered microglia activation and increased the expression of pattern recognition and phagocytic receptors. Abeta1-42 plaques were not detectable likely due to microglial elimination of infused oligomers. In addition, we found upregulation of neuronal inhibitory ligands and their cognate microglial receptors, while downregulation of Esr1 and Scn1a, encoding estrogen receptor alpha and voltage-gated sodium-channel Na(v)1.1, respectively, was observed. These changes were associated with impaired hippocampus-dependent spatial memory and resembled early neurological changes seen in Alzheimer's disease. To investigate the role of inflammatory actions in memory deterioration, we performed MCC950 infusion, which specifically blocks the NLRP3 inflammasome. MCC950 attenuated AbetaO-evoked microglia reactivity, restored expression of neuronal inhibitory ligands, reversed downregulation of ERalpha, and abolished memory impairments. Furthermore, MCC950 abrogated AbetaO-invoked reduction of serum IL-10. These findings provide evidence that in response to AbetaO infusion microglia change their phenotype, but the resulting inflammatory changes are sustained for at least one month after the end of AbetaO challenge. Lasting NLRP3-driven inflammatory alterations and altered hippocampal gene expression contribute to spatial memory decline.",

    "abstract": "The function of the beta-A4 amyloid protein precursor (APP) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. APP has a number of putative roles in neuronal differentiation, survival, synaptogenesis and cell adhesion. In this study, we examined the development of axons, dendrites and synapses in cultures of hippocampus neutrons derived from APP knockout (KO) mice. We report that loss of APP function reduces the branching of cultured hippocampal neurons, resulting in reduced synapse formation. Using a compartmentalised culture approach, we found reduced axonal outgrowth in cultured hippocampal neurons and we also identified abnormal growth characteristics of isolated hippocampal neuron axons. Although APP has previously been suggested to play an important role in promoting cell adhesion, we surprisingly found that APPKO hippocampal neurons adhered more strongly to a poly-L-lysine substrate and their neurites displayed an increased density of focal adhesion puncta. The findings suggest that the function of APP has an important role in both dendritic and axonal growth and that endogenous APP may regulate substrate adhesion of hippocampal neurons. The results may explain neuronal and synaptic morphological abnormalities in APPKO mice and the presence of abnormal APP expression in dystrophic neurites around amyloid deposits in AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rapidly reaching epidemic status among a burgeoning aging population. Much evidence suggests the toxicity of this amyloid disease is most influenced by the formation of soluble oligomeric forms of amyloid beta-protein, particularly the 42-residue alloform (Abeta42). Developing potential therapeutics in a directed, streamlined approach to treating this disease is necessary. Here we utilize the joint pharmacophore space (JPS) model to design a new molecule [AC0107] incorporating structural characteristics of known Abeta inhibitors, blood-brain barrier permeability, and limited toxicity. To test the molecule's efficacy experimentally, we employed ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) to discover [AC0107] inhibits the formation of the toxic Abeta42 dodecamer at both high (1:10) and equimolar concentrations of inhibitor. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments reveal that [AC0107] prevents further aggregation of Abeta42, destabilizes preformed fibrils, and reverses Abeta42 aggregation. This trend continues for long-term interaction times of 2 days until only small aggregates remain with virtually no fibrils or higher order oligomers surviving. Pairing JPS with IM-MS and AFM presents a powerful and effective first step for AD drug development. Graphical Abstract.",

    "abstract": "SUV ratios (SUVRs) are commonly used to quantify tracer uptake in amyloid-beta PET. Here, we explore the impact of target and reference region-of-interest (ROI) selection on SUVR effect sizes using interventional data from the ongoing phase 1b PRIME study (NCT01677572) of aducanumab (BIIB037) in patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer disease. Methods: The florbetapir PET SUVR was calculated at baseline (screening) and at weeks 26 and 54 for patients randomized to receive placebo and each of 4 aducanumab doses (1, 3, 6, and 10 mg/kg) using the whole cerebellum, cerebellar gray matter, cerebellar white matter, pons, and subcortical white matter as reference regions. In addition to the prespecified composite cortex target ROI, individual cerebral cortical ROIs were assessed as targets. Results: Of the reference regions used, subcortical white matter, cerebellar white matter, and the pons, alone or in combination, generated the largest effect sizes. The use of the anterior cingulate cortex as a target ROI resulted in larger effect sizes than the use of the composite cortex. SUVR calculations were not affected by correction for brain volume changes over time. Conclusion: Dose- and time-dependent reductions in the amyloid PET SUVR were consistently observed with aducanumab only in cortical regions prone to amyloid plaque deposition, regardless of the reference region used. These data support the hypothesis that florbetapir SUVR responses associated with aducanumab treatment are a result of specific dose- and time-dependent reductions in the amyloid burden in patients with Alzheimer disease.",

However, the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which considers Abeta accumulation the only causative agent of the disease, has proven to be incomplete if not wrong. In recent years, actors such as metal ions, oxidative stress, and other cofactors have been proposed as possible co-agents or, in some cases, main causative factors of AD. In this scenario, MS investigation has proven to be fundamental to design possible diagnostic strategies of this elusive disease, as well as to understand the biomolecular mechanisms involved, in the attempt to find a possible therapeutic solution. We review the current applications of MS in the search for possible Abeta biomarkers of AD to help the diagnosis of the disease.

    "abstract": "Extracellular aggregates of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, which are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), act as an essential trigger for glial cell activation and the release of ATP, leading to the stimulation of purinergic receptors, especially the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R). However, the involvement of P2X7R in the development of AD is still ill-defined regarding the dual properties of this receptor. Particularly, P2X7R activates the NLRP3 inflammasome leading to the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1beta; however, P2X7R also induces cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein generating Abeta peptides or the neuroprotective fragment sAPPalpha. We thus explored in detail the functions of P2X7R in AD transgenic mice. Here, we show that P2X7R deficiency reduced Abeta lesions, rescued cognitive deficits and improved synaptic plasticity in AD mice. However, the lack of P2X7R did not significantly affect the release of IL-1beta or the levels of non-amyloidogenic fragment, sAPPalpha, in AD mice. Instead, our results show that P2X7R plays a critical role in Abeta peptide-mediated release of chemokines, particularly CCL3, which is associated with pathogenic CD8+ T cell recruitment. In conclusion, our study highlights a novel detrimental function of P2X7R in chemokine release and supports the notion that P2X7R may be a promising therapeutic target for AD.",

Nitrostyrene derivative Z-10 is the first identified nitro-ligand of RXRalpha. We hypothesized that Z-10 and its derivatives have the similar effect as bexarotene.

Our reporter gene assays showed that the derivatives with substituted groups of methyl and methoxyl in position 2 were more potent to activate Gal4-DBD/RXRalpha-LBD and RXRalpha homodimer as well as RXRalpha heterodimers than the corresponding 4-substituted derivatives. The derivatives with hydroxyl substitution in either 2- or 4-position failed to activate RXRalpha. Consistently, the derivatives with stronger potency of RXRalpha activation had higher RXRalpha binding affinity. Z-10 and its 2-ethyoxyl substituted derivative Z-36 reduced Abeta plaques in both hippocampus and cortex of AD mouse model significantly, of which Z-36 had stronger efficacy. This may due to the stronger ability of Z-36 than Z-10 in activating RXR/LXR and RXR/PPAR heterodimers and inducing ABCA1 and ABCG1 expressions. Thus, the 2- rather than 4-position was the better site for Z-10 modification as to RXRalpha transactivation, and Z-36 is an optimized derivative of Z-10 as to reducing Abeta plaques in AD mouse model.",

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze acetyl group removal from histone proteins, leading to altered chromatin structure and gene expression. HDAC2 is highly expressed in adult brain, and HDAC2 levels are elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. We previously reported that neuron-specific splice isoforms of Endophilin-B1 (Endo-B1) promote neuronal survival, but are reduced in human AD brain and mouse models of AD and stroke. Here, we demonstrate that HDAC2 suppresses Endo-B1 expression. HDAC2 knockdown or knockout enhances expression of Endo-B1. Conversely, HDAC2 overexpression decreases Endo-B1 expression. We also demonstrate that neurons exposed to beta-amyloid increase HDAC2 and reduce histone H3 acetylation while HDAC2 knockdown prevents Abeta induced loss of histone H3 acetylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase-3 activation, and neuronal death. The protective effect of HDAC2 knockdown was abrogated by Endo-B1 shRNA and in Endo-B1-null neurons, suggesting that HDAC2-induced neurotoxicity is mediated through suppression of Endo-B1. HDAC2 overexpression also modulates neuronal expression of mitofusin2 (Mfn2) and mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), recapitulating the pattern of change observed in AD. HDAC2 knockout mice demonstrate reduced injury in the middle cerebral artery occlusion with reperfusion (MCAO/R) model of cerebral ischemia demonstrating enhanced neuronal survival, minimized loss of Endo-B1, and normalized expression of Mfn2. These findings support the hypothesis that HDAC2 represses Endo-B1, sensitizing neurons to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in stroke and AD.",

We show that treatment with beta amyloid peptide 1-42 (Abeta) accelerates the occurrence of morphological and biochemical aging markers in human RBCs and influences the cell metabolism leading to intracellular ATP depletion. The morphological pattern has been monitored using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) imaging and measuring the RBCs' plasma membrane roughness employed as a morphological parameter capable to provide information on the structure and integrity of the membrane-skeleton. Results evidence that Abeta boosts the development of crenatures and proto-spicules simultaneously to acceleration in the weakening of the cell-cytoskeleton contacts and to the induction of peculiar nanoscale features on the cell membrane. Incubation in the presence of glucose can remove all but the latter Abeta-induced effects. Biochemical data demonstrate that contemporaneously to morphological and structural alterations, Abeta and glucose depletion trigger a complex signaling pathway involving caspase 3, protein kinase C (PKC) and nitric oxide derived metabolites. As a whole, the collected data revealed that, the damaging path induced by Abeta in RBC provide a sequence of morphological and functional intermediates following one another along RBC life span, including: (i) an acceleration in the development of shape alteration typically observed along the RBC's aging; (ii) the development of characteristic membrane features on the plasma membrane and (iii) triggering a complex signaling pathway involving caspase 3, PKC and nitric oxide derived metabolites.",

Some findings in human and animal models have linked T2DM to AD-type dementia. Despite epidemiological associations between the T2DM and cognitive impairment, the interrelational mechanisms are unclear. The preponderance of evidence in longitudinal studies with autopsy confirmation have indicated that vascular mechanisms, rather than classic AD-type pathologies, underlie the cognitive decline often seen in self-reported T2DM. T2DM is associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and is associated with increased risk of infarcts and small vessel disease in the brain and other organs. Neuropathological examinations of post-mortem brains demonstrated evidence of cerebrovascular disease and little to no correlation between T2DM and beta-amyloid deposits or neurofibrillary tangles. Nevertheless, the mechanisms upstream of early AD-specific pathology remain obscure. In this regard, there may indeed be overlap between the pathologic mechanisms of T2DM/\"metabolic syndrome,\" and AD. More specifically, cerebral insulin processing, glucose metabolism, mitochondrial function, and/or lipid metabolism could be altered in patients in early AD and directly influence symptomatology and/or neuropathology.",

    "title": "Self-Assembled Curcumin-Poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) Conjugates: Potent Nano-Inhibitors against Amyloid beta-Protein Fibrillogenesis and Cytotoxicity.",
    "abstract": "Fibrillogenesis of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, so inhibition of Abeta aggregation is considered as an important strategy for the precaution and treatment of AD. Curcumin (Cur) has been recognized as an effective inhibitor of Abeta fibrillogenesis, but its potential application is limited by its poor bioavailability. Herein, we proposed to conjugate Cur to a zwitterionic polymer, poly(carboxybetaine methacrylate) (pCB), and synthesized three Cur@pCB conjugates of different degrees of substitution (DS, 1.9-2.9). Cur@pCB conjugates self-assembled into nanogels of 120-190 nm. The inhibition effects of Cur@pCB conjugates on the fibrillation and cytotoxicity of Abeta42 was investigated by extensive biophysical and biological analyses. Thioflavin T fluorescence assays and atomic force microscopic observations revealed that the Cur@pCB conjugates were much more efficient than molecular curcumin on inhibiting Abeta42 fibrillation, and cytotoxicity assays also indicated the same tendency. Of the three conjugates, Cur1@pCB of the lowest DS (1.97) exhibited the best performance; 5 muM Cur1@pCB functioned similarly with 25 muM free curcumin. Moreover, 5 muM Cur1@pCB increased the cell viability by 43% but free curcumin at the same concentration showed little effect. It is considered that the highly hydrated state of the zwitterionic polymers resulted in the superiority of Cur@pCB over free curcumin. Namely, the dense hydration layer on the conjugates strongly stabilized the bound Abeta on curcumin anchored on the polymer, suppressing the conformational transition of the protein to beta-sheet-rich structures. This was demonstrated by circular dichroism spectroscopy, in which Cur1@pCB was proven to be the strongest in the three conjugates. The research has thus revealed a new function of zwitterionic polymer pCBMA and provided new insights into the development of more potent nanoinhibitors for suppressing Abeta fibrillogenesis and cytotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "It is an open issue whether blood biomarkers serve to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) or monitor its progression over time from prodromal stages. Here, we addressed this question starting from data of the European FP7 IMI-PharmaCog/E-ADNI longitudinal study in amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients including biological, clinical, neuropsychological (e.g., ADAS-Cog13), neuroimaging, and electroencephalographic measures. PharmaCog/E-ADNI patients were classified as \"positive\" (i.e., \"prodromal AD\" n = 76) or \"negative\" (n = 52) based on a diagnostic cut-off of Abeta42/P-tau in cerebrospinal fluid as well as APOE epsilon 4 genotype. Blood was sampled at baseline and at two follow-ups (12 and 18 months), when plasma amyloid peptide 42 and 40 (Abeta42, Abeta40) and apolipoprotein J (clusterin, CLU) were assessed. Linear Mixed Models found no significant differences in plasma molecules between the \"positive\" (i.e., prodromal AD) and \"negative\" groups at baseline. In contrast, plasma Abeta42 showed a greater reduction over time in the prodromal AD than the \"negative\" aMCI group (p = 0.048), while CLU and Abeta40 increased, but similarly in the two groups. Furthermore, plasma Abeta42 correlated with the ADAS-Cog13 score both in aMCI patients as a whole and the prodromal AD group alone. Finally, CLU correlated with the ADAS-Cog13 only in the whole aMCI group, and no association with ADAS-Cog13 was found for Abeta40. In conclusion, plasma Abeta42 showed disease progression-related features in aMCI patients with prodromal AD.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid fibrillation is associated with several human maladies, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's diseases, prions, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and type 2 diabetes diseases. Gaining insights into the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation and exploring novel approaches to fibrillation inhibition are crucial for preventing amyloid diseases. Here, we hypothesized that ligands capable of stabilizing the native state of query proteins might prevent protein unfolding, which, in turn, may reduce the propensity of proteins to form amyloid fibrils. We demonstrated the efficient inhibition of amyloid formation of the human serum albumin (HSA) (up to 85%) and human insulin (up to 80%) by a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen (IBFN). IBFN significantly increases the conformational stability of both HSA and insulin, as confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Moreover, increasing concentration of IBFN boosts its amyloid inhibitory propensity in a linear fashion by influencing the nucleation phase as assayed by thioflavin T fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering. Furthermore, circular dichroism analysis supported the DSC results, showing that IBFN binds to the native state of proteins and almost completely prevents their tendency to lose secondary and tertiary structures. Cell toxicity assay confirms that species formed in the presence of IBFN are less toxic to neuronal cells (SH-SY5Y). These results demonstrate the feasibility of using a small molecule to stabilize the native state of proteins, thereby preventing the amyloidogenic conformational changes, which appear to be the common link in several human amyloid diseases.",

    "title": "Coconut oil decreases expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and secretion of amyloid peptides through inhibition of ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1).",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), affecting 5.3 million people in the U.S., impairs portions of the brain controlling memories. In humans, mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene has been implicated in increased plaque formation, which can block the communication between nerve cells, decrease dendritic formation and increase cell death, and promote neuroinflammation. As coconut oil has been suggested to alleviate the symptoms in AD patients, we examined the impact of coconut oil on APP expression and secretion of amyloid peptides in N2a cells expressing the human APP gene (N2a/APP695). We found that coconut oil treatment decreased APP expression in N2a cells and reduced the secretion of amyloid peptides Abeta40 and Abeta42. Moreover, coconut oil treatment promoted differentiation of N2a cells. Our data suggest that ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1 (ARF1) may contribute to the effects of coconut oil on APP expression and secretion of Abeta. A high ARF1 expression was also detected in the primary neuronal cells from the mice overexpressing the Swedish mutant APP. Immunostaining results revealed that APP is co-localized with ARF1 in the Golgi apparatus and this interaction is impaired after coconut oil treatment. Furthermore, knockdown of ARF-1 using siRNA decreased secretion of amyloid peptides, confirming the impact of ARF1 on the secretion of amyloid peptides. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that coconut oil decreases intracellular ARF1 expression, thereby resulting in an inhibition of APP and amyloid beta secretion. This study reveals a novel mechanism for intracellular APP processing in neuronal cells.",

    "title": "Specific mutations in presenilin 1 cause conformational changes in gamma-secretase to modulate amyloid beta trimming.",
    "abstract": "gamma-Secretase generates amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) from amyloid precursor protein through multistep cleavages, such as endoproteolysis (epsilon-cleavage) and trimming (gamma-cleavage). Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutations within the catalytic subunit protein of presenilin 1 (PS1) decrease gamma-cleavage, resulting in the generation of toxic, long Abetas. Reducing long Abeta levels has been proposed as an AD therapeutic strategy. Previously, we identified PS1 mutations that are active in the absence of nicastrin (NCT) using a yeast gamma-secretase assay. Here, we analysed these PS1 mutations in the presence of NCT, and found that they were constitutively active in yeast. One triple, 13 double, and 5 single mutants enhanced epsilon-cleavage activity up to 2.7-fold. Furthermore, L241I, F411Y, S438P and F441L mutations modulated trimming activities to produce more short-Abeta in yeast microsomes. When introduced in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, these mutations possessed similar or reduced epsilon-cleavage activity. However, two mutations, L241I and S438P, modulated trimming activities and changed the conformation of transmembrane domain 1, the substrate recognition site. These mutants had the opposite modulatory effects of FAD mutations and produced more short Abetas and fewer long Abetas. Our results provide insights into the relationship between PS1 conformational changes and gamma-secretase activities.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the gene encoding the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), clinically and pathologically indistinguishable from the majority of 'sporadic' cases of ALS, establishing altered TDP-43 function and distribution as a primary mechanism of neurodegeneration. Transgenic mouse models in which TDP-43 is overexpressed only partially recapitulate the key cellular pathology of human ALS, but may also lead to non-specific toxicity. To avoid the potentially confounding effects of overexpression, and to maintain regulated spatio-temporal and cell-specific expression, we generated mice in which an 80 kb genomic fragment containing the intact human TDP-43 locus (either TDP-43WT or TDP-43M337V) and its regulatory regions was integrated into the Rosa26 (Gt(ROSA26)Sor) locus in a single copy. At 3 months of age, TDP-43M337V mice are phenotypically normal but by around 6 months develop progressive motor function deficits associated with loss of neuromuscular junction integrity, leading to a reduced lifespan. RNA sequencing shows that widespread mis-splicing is absent prior to the development of a motor phenotype, though differential expression analysis reveals a distinct transcriptional profile in pre-symptomatic TDP-43M337V spinal cords. Despite the presence of clear motor abnormalities, there was no evidence of TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregation in vivo at any timepoint. In primary embryonic spinal motor neurons and in embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived motor neurons, mutant TDP-43 undergoes cytoplasmic mislocalisation, and is associated with altered stress granule assembly and dynamics. Overall, this mouse model provides evidence that ALS may arise through acquired TDP-43 toxicity associated with defective stress granule function. The normal phenotype until 6 months of age can facilitate the study of early pathways underlying ALS.",

    "abstract": "While clusterin is reportedly involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, how clusterin interacts with amyloid-beta (Ass) to cause Ass neurotoxicity remains unclear in vivo. Using 5xFAD transgenic mice, which develop robust AD pathology and memory deficits when very young, we detected interactions between clusterin and Ass in the mouse brains. The two proteins were concurrently upregulated and bound or colocalized with each other in the same complexes or in amyloid plaques. Neuropathology and cognitive performance were assessed in the progeny of clusterin-null mice crossed with 5xFAD mice, yielding clu-/- ;5xFAD and clu+/+ ;5xFAD. We found far less of the various pools of Ass proteins, most strikingly soluble Ass oligomers and amyloid plaques in clu-/- ;5xFAD mice at 5 months of age. At that age, those mice also had higher levels of neuronal and synaptic proteins and better motor coordination, spatial learning and memory than age-matched clu+/+ ;5xFAD mice. However, at 10 months of age, these differences disappeared, with Ass and plaque deposition, neuronal and synaptic proteins and impairment of behavioral and cognitive performance similar in both groups. These findings demonstrate that clusterin is necessarily involved in early stages of AD pathogenesis by enhancing toxic Ass pools to cause Ass-directed neurodegeneration and behavioral and cognitive impairments, but not in late stage.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to progressive loss of neurons which often results in deterioration of memory and cognitive function. The development of AD is highly associated with the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid beta (Abeta) induces neurotoxicity and contributes to the development of AD. Recent evidences also highlighted the importance of neuroglobin (Ngb) in ameliorating AD. This study assessed the ability of fucosterol, a phytosterol found in brown alga, in protecting SH-SY5Y cells against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. Its effects on the mRNA levels of APP and Ngb as well as the intracellular Abeta levels were also determined in Abeta-induced SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to fucosterol prior to Abeta treatment. The effect on apoptosis was determined using Annexin V FITC staining and mRNA expression was studied using RT-PCR. Flow cytometry confirmed the protective effects of fucosterol on SH-SY5Y cells against Abeta-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment with fucosterol increased the Ngb mRNA levels but reduced the levels of APP mRNA and intracellular Abeta in Abeta-induced SH-SY5Y cells. These observations demonstrated the protective properties of fucosterol against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in neuronal cells.",

    "abstract": "PET imaging of amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits in brain has become an important aid in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, and an inclusion criterion for patient enrolment into clinical trials of new anti-Abeta treatments. Available PET radioligands visualizing Abeta bind to insoluble fibrils, i.e. Abeta plaques. Levels of prefibrillar Abeta forms, e.g. soluble oligomers and protofibrils, correlate better than plaques with disease severity and these soluble species are the neurotoxic form of Abeta leading to neurodegeneration. The goal was to create an antibody-based radioligand, recognizing not only fibrillary Abeta, but also smaller and still soluble aggregates. We designed and expressed a small recombinant bispecific antibody construct, di-scFv 3D6-8D3, targeting the Abeta N-terminus and the transferrin receptor (TfR). Natively expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), TfR could thus be used as a brain-blood shuttle. Di-scFv 3D6-8D3 bound to Abeta1-40 with high affinity and to TfR with moderate affinity. Di-scFv [124I]3D6-8D3 was injected in two transgenic mouse models overexpressing human Abeta and wild-type control mice and PET scanned at 14, 24 or 72 h after injection. Di-scFv [124I]3D6-8D3 was retained in brain of transgenic animals while it was cleared from wild-type lacking Abeta. This difference was observed from 24 h onwards, and at 72 h, 18 months old transgenic animals, with high load of Abeta pathology, displayed SUVR of 2.2-3.5 in brain while wild-type showed ratios close to unity. A subset of the mice were also scanned with [11C]PIB. Again wt mice displayed ratios of unity while transgenes showed slightly, non-significantly, elevated SUVR of 1.2, indicating improved sensitivity with novel di-scFv [124I]3D6-8D3 compared with [11C]PIB. Brain concentrations of di-scFv [124I]3D6-8D3 correlated with soluble Abeta (p < 0.0001) but not with total Abeta, i.e. plaque load (p = 0.34). We have successfully created a small bispecific antibody-based radioligand capable of crossing the BBB, subsequently binding to and visualizing intrabrain Abeta in vivo. The radioligand displayed better sensitivity compared with [11C]PIB, and brain concentrations correlated with soluble neurotoxic Abeta aggregates.",

Here, we mapped the spatial distribution of Abeta plaques across age in three APP-overexpression mouse lines (APP/PS1, Tg2576, and hAPP-J20) using in vivo labeling with methoxy-X04, high throughput whole brain imaging, and an automated informatics pipeline. Images were acquired with high resolution serial two-photon tomography and labeled plaques were detected using custom-built segmentation algorithms. Image series were registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework, a 3D reference atlas, enabling automated brain-wide quantification of plaque density, number, and location. In both APP/PS1 and Tg2576 mice, plaques were identified first in isocortex, followed by olfactory, hippocampal, and cortical subplate areas. In hAPP-J20 mice, plaque density was highest in hippocampal areas, followed by isocortex, with little to no involvement of olfactory or cortical subplate areas. Within the major brain divisions, distinct regions were identified with high (or low) plaque accumulation; for example, the lateral visual area within the isocortex of APP/PS1 mice had relatively higher plaque density compared with other cortical areas, while in hAPP-J20 mice, plaques were densest in the ventral retrosplenial cortex. In summary, we show how whole brain imaging of amyloid pathology in mice reveals the extent to which a given model recapitulates the regional Abeta deposition patterns described in AD.",

    "abstract": "Our objective was to determine the optimal approach for assessing amyloid disease in a cognitively normal elderly population. Methods: Dynamic 18F-flutemetamol PET scans were acquired using a coffee-break protocol (a 0- to 30-min scan and a 90- to 110-min scan) on 190 cognitively normal elderly individuals (mean age, 70.4 y; 60% female). Parametric images were generated from SUV ratio (SUVr) and nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) methods, with cerebellar gray matter as a reference region, and were visually assessed by 3 trained readers. Interreader agreement was calculated using kappa-statistics, and semiquantitative values were obtained. Global cutoffs were calculated for both SUVr and BPND using a receiver-operating-characteristic analysis and the Youden index. Visual assessment was related to semiquantitative classifications. Results: Interreader agreement in visual assessment was moderate for SUVr (kappa = 0.57) and good for BPND images (kappa = 0.77). There was discordance between readers for 35 cases (18%) using SUVr and for 15 cases (8%) using BPND, with 9 overlapping cases. For the total cohort, the mean (+-SD) SUVr and BPND were 1.33 (+-0.21) and 0.16 (+-0.12), respectively. Most of the 35 cases (91%) for which SUVr image assessment was discordant between readers were classified as negative based on semiquantitative measurements. Conclusion: The use of parametric BPND images for visual assessment of 18F-flutemetamol in a population with low amyloid burden improves interreader agreement. Implementing semiquantification in addition to visual assessment of SUVr images can reduce false-positive classification in this population.",

This proposed research framework represents a fundamental change in how we think about Alzheimer's disease, moving from diagnosis based on clinical features to diagnosis based solely on biomarkers. These recommendations are contentious and have important implications for patients, clinicians, policy makers and the pharmaceutical industry. In this commentary, we offer a summary of the NIA-AA research framework. We then focus on five key areas: divorcing neuropathology from the clinical syndrome; the emphasis placed on one dementia subtype; validity of available biomarkers; the changing meaning of the term 'Alzheimer's disease'; and the potential for a research framework to influence clinical practice.",

    "title": "Distinct cytokine profiles in human brains resilient to Alzheimer's pathology.",
    "abstract": "Our group has previously studied the brains of some unique individuals who are able to tolerate robust amounts of Alzheimer's pathological lesions (amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) without experiencing dementia while alive. These rare resilient cases do not demonstrate the patterns of neuronal/synaptic loss that are normally found in the brains of typical demented Alzheimer's patients. Moreover, they exhibit decreased astrocyte and microglial activation markers GFAP and CD68, suggesting that a suppressed neuroinflammatory response may be implicated in human brain resilience to Alzheimer's pathology. In the present work, we used a multiplexed immunoassay to profile a panel of 27 cytokines in the brains of controls, typical demented Alzheimer's cases, and two groups of resilient cases, which possessed pathology consistent with either high probability (HP, Braak stage V-VI and CERAD 2-3) or intermediate probability (IP, Braak state III-IV and CERAD 1-3) of Alzheimer's disease in the absence of dementia. We used a multivariate partial least squares regression approach to study differences in cytokine expression between resilient cases and both Alzheimer's and control cases. Our analysis identified distinct profiles of cytokines in the entorhinal cortex (one of the earliest and most severely affected brain regions in Alzheimer's disease) that are up-regulated in both HP and IP resilient cases relative to Alzheimer's and control cases. These cytokines, including IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-13, and IL-4 in HP resilient cases and IL-6, IL-10, and IP-10 in IP resilient cases, delineate differential inflammatory activity in brains resilient to Alzheimer's pathology compared to Alzheimer's cases. Of note, these cytokines all have been associated with pathogen clearance and/or the resolution of inflammation. Moreover, our analysis in the superior temporal sulcus (a multimodal association cortex that consistently accumulates Alzheimer's pathology at later stages of the disease along with overt symptoms of dementia) revealed increased expression of neurotrophic factors, such as PDGF-bb and basic FGF in resilient compared to AD cases. The same region also had reduced expression of chemokines associated with microglial recruitment, including MCP-1 in HP resilient cases and MIP-1alpha in IP resilient cases compared to AD. Altogether, our data suggest that different patterns of cytokine expression exist in the brains of resilient and Alzheimer's cases, link these differences to reduced glial activation, increased neuronal survival and preserved cognition in resilient cases, and reveal specific cytokine targets that may prove relevant to the identification of novel mechanisms of brain resiliency to Alzheimer's pathology.",

Elucidating the relationships of Abeta with gray matter atrophy in DLB may yield insights regarding the contributions of comorbid Alzheimer's disease to its disease progression. Twenty healthy controls and 25 DLB subjects underwent clinical assessment, [18F]-Florbetapir, and 3T magnetic resonance imaging. FreeSurfer was used to estimate cortical thickness and subcortical volumes, and PetSurfer was used to quantify [18F]-Florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio. Principal component analysis was used to identify the dominant Abeta component for correlations with regional cortical thickness, hippocampal subfields, and subcortical structures. Relative to healthy controls, the DLB group demonstrated increased Abeta in widespread regions encompassing the frontal and temporoparietal cortices, whereas cortical thinning was restricted to the temporal lobe. Among DLB subjects, the Abeta component was significantly associated with more severe hippocampal and subiculum atrophy. These findings may reflect an early process of superimposed AD-like atrophy in DLB, thereby conferring support for the therapeutic potential of anti-Abeta interventions in people with DLB.",

    "abstract": "It is known that copper ion (Cu(II)) binds to amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), induces Abeta oligomer formation and ultimately exacerbates Abeta-aggregation neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It becomes interesting to know that how this chemical modification of Abeta would affect interaction of Abeta and Cu(II) and their roles in the development of AD. In this work, we investigated the interaction of Abeta1-42 nitration with the toxic Cu(II). It showed that Cu(II)induced Abeta1-42 nitration in the presence of nitrite and hydrogen peroxide. Circular dichroism studies also revealed significant conformational change of Abeta1-42 and Tyr10 nitrated amyloid-beta peptide(1-42) (Abeta1-42NT) when interacting with Cu(II). Even though nitration did not alter the binding of Abeta1-42 to Cu(II) or the peroxidative activity of Abeta1-42-Cu(II) complex, nitration ameliorated the aggregation and neurotoxicity of Abeta1-42 induced by Cu(II), which was also further confirmed by the cell study. Given our previous findings that Abeta nitration dramatically inhibited its aggregation and thus reduced its toxicity, we speculated that nitration of Abeta1-42 altered its intermolecular interaction, which protected itself against the toxicity of Cu(II). Based on this hypothesis, we propose that nitration of Abeta1-42 may be an important protective mechanism for normal function of Abeta1-42 and deserves more attention in AD drug development.",

Using Pittsburgh Compound B ([11C]PiB), a pattern of striatal amyloid beta (Abeta) that is elevated relative to neocortical binding has been reported, similar to that of nondemented autosomal dominant AD mutation carriers. However, it is not known whether changes in striatal and neocortical [11C]PiB retention differ over time in a nondemented DS population when compared to changes in a nondemented elderly (NDE) population. The purpose of this work was to assess longitudinal changes in trajectories of Abeta in a nondemented DS compared to an NDE cohort. The regional trajectories for anterior ventral striatum (AVS), frontal cortex, and precuneus [11C]PiB retention were explored over time using linear mixed effects models with fixed effects of time, cohort, and time-by-cohort interactions and subject as random effects. Significant differences between DS and NDE cohort trajectories for all 3 region of interests were observed (p < 0.05), with the DS cohort showing a faster accumulation in the AVS and slower accumulation in the frontal cortex and precuneus compared to the NDE cohort. These data add to the previously reported distinct pattern of early striatal deposition not commonly seen in sporadic AD by demonstrating that individuals with DS may also accumulate Abeta at a rate faster in the AVS when compared to NDE subjects.",

APLP2-KO and WT (on C57Bl6 background) littermates control mice from 8 (young adulthood) to 48 weeks (middle age) were investigated. Analysis of motor neuron and muscle morphology showed APLP2-KO females but not males, had less age-related motor function impairments. We observed age and sex differences in both motor neuron number and muscle fiber size distribution for APLP2-KO mice compared to WT (C57Bl6). These alterations in the motor neuron number and muscle fiber distribution pattern may explain why female APLP2-KO mice have far better motor function behaviour during ageing.",

    "title": "Accurate risk estimation of beta-amyloid positivity to identify prodromal Alzheimer's disease: Cross-validation study of practical algorithms.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The aim was to create readily available algorithms that estimate the individual risk of beta-amyloid (Abeta) positivity. METHODS: The algorithms were tested in BioFINDER (n = 391, subjective cognitive decline or mild cognitive impairment) and validated in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 661, subjective cognitive decline or mild cognitive impairment). The examined predictors of Abeta status were demographics; cognitive tests; white matter lesions; apolipoprotein E (APOE); and plasma Abeta42/Abeta40, tau, and neurofilament light. RESULTS: Abeta status was accurately estimated in BioFINDER using age, 10-word delayed recall or Mini-Mental State Examination, and APOE (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve = 0.81 [0.77-0.85] to 0.83 [0.79-0.87]). When validated, the models performed almost identical in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve = 0.80-0.82) and within different age, subjective cognitive decline, and mild cognitive impairment populations. Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 improved the models slightly. DISCUSSION: The algorithms are implemented on http://amyloidrisk.com where the individual probability of being Abeta positive can be calculated. This is useful in the workup of prodromal Alzheimer's disease and can reduce the number needed to screen in Alzheimer's disease trials.",

    "abstract": "Methamphetamine (METH) abusing contributes to dopaminergic neurons degeneration, resulting inParkinson's disease (PD)-like changes. More recently, the association between METH exposure and the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like changes gained more attention, however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether METH exposure promotes the formation of Abeta42, one of the key AD-like pathological proteins. With the cell model PC-12 cell line, it showed that METH treatment significantly increased the level of the precursor protein APP and its hydrolysates CTFs expression in a dose-dependent manner. In parallel, with the ELISA assay, we found that METH exposure contributed to an obvious elevation of the Abeta1-42 excretion in the cell culture supernatant. Therefore, we examined the expression of p-GSK3alpha and BACE-1, which were responsible for APP and Abeta1-42 generation respectively, it suggested in that METH obviously activated the p-GSK3alpha and increased the level of BACE-1, and the expression of BACE-1 was also detected by the immunofluorescence, with the significant elevation of the BACE-1 fluorescence intensity. In conclusion, METH treatment promotes the expression of Abeta precursor protein APP and its hydrolysis product CTFs and Abeta1-42, and p-GSK3alpha as well as BACE-1 may be involved in this process.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether brain amyloid burden in elderly patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is lower than in controls, and to assess in patients with NT1 the relationships between amyloid burden, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) markers of Alzheimer disease (AD), CSF orexin-A, and cognitive profile. METHODS: Cognitive and 18 F-florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) data were compared in patients with NT1 aged >= 65 years (n = 23) and in age- and sex-matched controls free of clinical dementia selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n = 69) and the Multi-Domain Intervention Alzheimer's Prevention Trial (MAPT-18F AV45-PET; n = 23) cohorts. The standardized uptake values (SUVs) of the cortical retention index for 6 regions of interest were computed and averaged to create a mean SUV ratio normalized to 3 subcortical reference regions (cerebellum, pons, and a composite region). A cortical/cerebellum SUV ratio >= 1.17 defined positive PET amyloid. RESULTS: Lower cortical amyloid burden was observed in the NT1 than in the ADNI and MAPT-AV45 groups (mean cortical/cerebellum SUV ratios = 0.95 +- 0.15, 1.11 +- 0.18 [p < 0.0001], and 1.14 +- 0.17 [p = 0.0005], respectively). Similar results were obtained with all subcortical reference regions and for all cortical regions of interest, except cingulum. Only 1 patient with NT1 (4.4%) had positive PET amyloid compared with 27.5% in the ADNI and 30.4% in the MAPT-AV45 group. In the NT1 group, cortical or regional amyloid load was not associated with CSF orexin-A, CSF AD biomarkers, or neuropsychological profile. INTERPRETATION: Lower brain amyloid burden, assessed by 18 F-florbetapir PET, in patients with NT1 suggests delayed appearance of amyloid plaques. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:74-83.",

    "abstract": "The beta-amyloid peptide Abeta1-42 is the most effective peptide in the process of forming plaque and creating Alzheimer's. After the separation of Abeta1-42 from APP membrane protein, the membrane surface is transmitted to the extracellular environment, which is a crowded environment. On the other hand, stability of salt bridges Asp23-Lys28 and Lys28-Ala42 is important for monomer toxicity and fibrillation formation. In this work, the effects of ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, heptanol and octanol on the Asp23-Lys28 and Lys28-Ala42 salt bridges of the Abeta1-42 have been investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. The radial distribution function of the oxygen atoms of the water around the atoms Cgamma-Asp23, Nxi-Lys28 and O-Ala42 was calculated in the presence of the alcohols. The results show that the peak height of the radial distribution function around the Cgamma-Asp23 atom is larger than the other two atoms. Also, the numbering of water molecules in the interval corresponding to the first peak in the radial distribution function for all atoms involved in the two salt bridges Asp23-Lys28 and Lys28-Ala42 was calculated. The results show that the obtained coordinate numbers are within the range of experimental numbers reported for water. The results also show that the order of water molecules around the O-Ala42 is lower. The results of solvent accessible surface area of Abeta1-42 show that the Lys28-Ala42 Salt bridge stability is more important for toxicity of monomer.",

    "abstract": "In the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is associated with oxidative stress, leading to cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. Betaine (glycine betaine or trimethylglycine), known as an osmolyte and methyl donor in mammalian cells, has been reported to suppress the proinflammatory response and oxidative stress in the kidneys, but the effects of betaine on brain diseases remain to be determined. Here, to investigate the effects of betaine treatment on cognitive impairment and the increase in oxidative stress in the brain of an AD animal model, we performed a novel object recognition test and measured the malondialdehyde (MDA; a marker of oxidative stress) levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of mice intracerebroventricularly injected with Abeta25-35, an active fragment of Abeta. Betaine prevented cognitive impairment as well as increases of the cortical and hippocampal MDA levels in Abeta25-35-injected mice. Of note, NNC 05-2090, a selective inhibitor of betaine/GABA transporter-1 (GAT2/BGT-1), reduced the preventive effects of betaine on Abeta25-35-induced cognitive impairment without affecting the increased MDA levels in the brain of Abeta25-35-injected mice. As betaine is used as a substrate of GAT2/BGT-1, these results suggest that betaine is transported through GAT2/BGT-1 and prevents cognitive impairment in Abeta25-35-injected mice, but GAT2/BGT-1 function is not required for the antioxidant effects of betaine.",

Materials and Methods Prospective 18F-FDG PET brain images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (2109 imaging studies from 2005 to 2017, 1002 patients) and retrospective independent test set (40 imaging studies from 2006 to 2016, 40 patients) were collected. Final clinical diagnosis at follow-up was recorded. Convolutional neural network of InceptionV3 architecture was trained on 90% of ADNI data set and tested on the remaining 10%, as well as the independent test set, with performance compared to radiologic readers. Model was analyzed with sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), saliency map, and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Results The algorithm achieved area under the ROC curve of 0.98 (95% confidence interval: 0.94, 1.00) when evaluated on predicting the final clinical diagnosis of AD in the independent test set (82% specificity at 100% sensitivity), an average of 75.8 months prior to the final diagnosis, which in ROC space outperformed reader performance (57% [four of seven] sensitivity, 91% [30 of 33] specificity; P < .05). Saliency map demonstrated attention to known areas of interest but with focus on the entire brain. Conclusion By using fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET of the brain, a deep learning algorithm developed for early prediction of Alzheimer disease achieved 82% specificity at 100% sensitivity, an average of 75.8 months prior to the final diagnosis.

    "abstract": "Neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) based therapy represents an attractive treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder with no effective treatment to date. This can be achieved by stimulating endogenous NSPCs and/or administrating exogenously produced NSPCs. Successful repair requires the migration of NSPCs to the loci where neuronal loss occurs, differentiation and integration into neural networks. However, the progressive loss of neurons in the brain of AD patients suggests that the repair by endogenous NSPCs in the setting of AD may be defective. The production and deposition of amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) peptides is thought to be a central event in the pathogenesis of AD. Here we report that Abeta1-42 peptides inhibit the migration of in vitro cultured NSPCs by disturbing the ERK-MAPK signal pathway. We found that the migratory capacity of NSPCs was compromised upon treatment with oligomeric Abeta1-42; the inhibitory effect occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Our previous studies have shown that Abeta1-42 triggers the expression of GRK2 by unknown mechanism. Herein we found that the Abeta1-42 evoked upregulation of GRK2 expression was attenuated upon treatment with the ERK inhibitor SCH772984 at 2.5 muM, but not with inhibitors for p38 or JNK. We detected a dose-dependent increase in levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 after incubation of cells with oligomeric Abeta1-42 peptides for 3 days. We observed that an increase in the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK coincided with reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 upon treatment with Abeta1-42 for 6 and/or 9 days. We hypothesize that the divergence of the activation of the MAPK family of pathways may contribute to the inhibition of NSPCs migration after the long-term incubation with Abeta1-42. Pretreatment with 1  muM MEK inhibitor U0126 reversed the effects of Abeta1-42 on GRK2 expression of and NSPC migration. Together, our results suggest that Abeta1-42 oligomers compromise the migratory capacity of NSPCs through the MEK-ERK pathway.",

    "abstract": "Soluble oligomeric forms of amyloid beta (Abeta) play an important role in causing the cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by targeting and disrupting synaptic pathways. Thus, the present research is directed toward identifying the neuronal pathways targeted by soluble forms and, accordingly, develops alternative therapeutic strategies. The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is synthesized as a precursor (pro-BDNF) which is cleaved extracellularly by plasmin to release the mature form. The conversion from pro-BDNF to BDNF is an important process that regulates neuronal activity and memory processes. Plasmin-dependent maturation of BDNF in the brain is regulated by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the natural inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). Therefore, tPA/PAI-1 system represents an important regulator of extracellular BDNF/pro-BDNF ratio. In this review, we summarize the data on the components of the plasminogen activation system and on BDNF in AD. Moreover, we will hypothesize a possible pathogenic mechanism caused by soluble Abeta forms based on the effects on tPA/PAI-1 system and on the consequence of an altered conversion from pro-BDNF to the mature BDNF in the brain of AD patients. Translation into clinic may include a better characterization of the disease stage and future direction on therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "The interaction of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) with thermolysin (TLN) was investigated by X-ray crystallography. Structural models of the complexes of TLN with several Abeta fragments show that, despite the numerous possible cleavage sites of the Abeta sequence, the C-terminal product of Ala30-Ile31 cleavage does not dissociate, thus inhibiting the enzyme. The high similarity between the TLN structural motif and neprilysin (NEP), the most extensively studied peptidase associated with Abeta clearance, suggests that NEP should be more efficient against Abeta polymorphs where Ala30-Ile31 is inaccessible, which is in agreement with studies in living mice that point to the limited role of NEP in degrading soluble Abeta and its higher ability to degrade insoluble and/or oligomeric Abeta forms, producing only the Abeta10-37 intermediate.",

    "title": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in the neuroprotective mechanism of neural stem cells against microglia-mediated toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells via the attenuation of tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloidogenesis.",
    "abstract": "The cognitive impairment caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau proteins, and is accompanied by inflammation. Recently, a novel inflammasome signaling pathway has been uncovered. Inflammasomes are implicated in the execution of inflammatory responses and pyroptotic death leading to neurodegeneration. Thus, the inflammasome signaling pathway could be a potential therapeutic target for AD. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are multipotent cells that can self-renew and differentiate into distinct neural cells. NSC therapy has been considered to be a promising therapeutic approach in protecting the central nervous system and restoring it following damage. However, the mechanisms involved remain unclear. The aims of this study were to investigate the protective effects of NE4C neural stem cells against microglia-mediated neurotoxicity and to explore molecular mechanisms mediating their actions. NE4C decreased the levels of caspase-1 and IL-1beta, and attenuated the level of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its associated protein adapter, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (ASC) in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells, possibly by regulating the phosphorylation of p38alpha MAPK. The conditioned media obtained from co-culture of LPS-stimulated BV2 and NE4C cells exhibited protective effects on SH-SY5Y cells against microglia-mediated neurotoxicity; this was associated with an attenuation of tau phosphorylation and amyloidogenesis and accompanied by down-regulation of GSK-3beta and p38alpha MAPK signalling pathways. In conclusion, the present study suggested that NSC therapy could be a potential strategy against microglia-mediated neurotoxicity. NSCs regulate NLRP3 activation and IL-1beta secretion, which are critical in the initiation of the inflammatory responses, hence preventing the release of neurotoxic pro-inflammatory factors by microglia. This eventually reduces tau hyperphosphylation and amyloidogenesis, possibly through the regulation of GSK-3beta and p38alpha MAPK signalling pathways, and thus protects SH-SY5Y cells against microglia-mediated neurotoxicity.",

Activated coagulation factor XIIIa (FXIIIa) covalently cross-links proteins in blood and vasculature, such as in blood clots and on the extracellular matrix. Although FXIIIa co-localizes with Abeta in CAA, the ability of FXIIIa to cross-link Abeta has not been demonstrated. Using Western blotting, kinetic assays, and microfluidic analyses, we show that FXIIIa covalently cross-links Abeta40 into dimers and oligomers (k cat/Km = 1.5 x 105 m-1s-1), as well as to fibrin, platelet proteins, and blood clots under flow in vitro Abeta40 also increased the stiffness of platelet-rich plasma clots in the presence of FXIIIa.

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular (CV)- and lifestyle-associated risk factors (RFs) are increasingly recognized as important for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Beyond the epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE), comparatively little is known about whether CV-associated genes also increase risk for AD. Using large genome-wide association studies and validated tools to quantify genetic overlap, we systematically identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) jointly associated with AD and one or more CV-associated RFs, namely body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease (CAD), waist hip ratio (WHR), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). In fold enrichment plots, we observed robust genetic enrichment in AD as a function of plasma lipids (TG, TC, LDL, and HDL); we found minimal AD genetic enrichment conditional on BMI, T2D, CAD, and WHR. Beyond APOE, at conjunction FDR < 0.05 we identified 90 SNPs on 19 different chromosomes that were jointly associated with AD and CV-associated outcomes. In meta-analyses across three independent cohorts, we found four novel loci within MBLAC1 (chromosome 7, meta-p = 1.44 x 10-9), MINK1 (chromosome 17, meta-p = 1.98 x 10-7) and two chromosome 11 SNPs within the MTCH2/SPI1 region (closest gene = DDB2, meta-p = 7.01 x 10-7 and closest gene = MYBPC3, meta-p = 5.62 x 10-8). In a large 'AD-by-proxy' cohort from the UK Biobank, we replicated three of the four novel AD/CV pleiotropic SNPs, namely variants within MINK1, MBLAC1, and DDB2. Expression of MBLAC1, SPI1, MINK1 and DDB2 was differentially altered within postmortem AD brains. Beyond APOE, we show that the polygenic component of AD is enriched for lipid-associated RFs. We pinpoint a subset of cardiovascular-associated genes that strongly increase the risk for AD. Our collective findings support a disease model in which cardiovascular biology is integral to the development of clinical AD in a subset of individuals.",

    "title": "Abeta stimulates microglial activation through antizyme-dependent downregulation of ornithine decarboxylase.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders. Its pathology is associated with the deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta), an abnormal extracellular peptide. Moreover, its pathological progression is closely accompanied by neuroinflammation. Specifically, Abeta-associated microglial overactivation may have the central role in AD pathogenesis. Interestingly, arginine metabolism may contribute to the equilibrium between M1 and M2 microglia. However, little is known about the involvement of arginine metabolism in Abeta-induced microglial neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. Moreover, the underlying mechanism by which Abeta induces the transition of microglia to the M1 phenotype remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of Abeta in mediating microglial activation and polarization both in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrated that under the Abeta treatment, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), a rate-limiting enzyme in the regulation of arginine catabolism, regulates microglial activation by altering the antizyme (AZ) + 1 ribosomal frameshift. Furthermore, the restoration of ODC protein expression levels has profound effects on inhibition of Abeta-induced M1 markers and thus attenuates microglial-mediated cytotoxicity. Altogether, our findings suggested that Abeta may contribute to M1-like activation by disrupting the balance between ODC and AZ in microglia.",

    "abstract": "Importance: Accumulating data suggest that elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light (NfL) and neurogranin (Ng) levels are associated with cognitive decline and may be useful markers of neurodegeneration. However, to our knowledge, previous studies have not assessed these CSF markers in the community, evaluated them with regards to risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or compared their prognostic value with CSF total tau (T-tau) or phosphorylated tau (P-tau). Objective: To determine (1) whether CSF NfL and Ng levels were associated with risk of MCI, (2) the effect size of these markers compared with CSF T-tau or P-tau for risk of MCI, and (3) whether CSF amyloid-beta (Abeta42) modified these associations. Design, Setting and Participants: The analyses included 648 participants without cognitive impairment who were enrolled into the prospective population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging between January 2004 and December 2015 with available CSF data and at least 1 follow-up visit. Participants were followed up for a median of 3.8 years (interquartile range, 2.6-5.4 years). The CSF NfL and Ng levels were measured using an in-house sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The CSF Abeta42, T-tau, and P-tau levels were measured with automated electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. Cox proportional hazards models, with age as the timescale, were used to assess the association between CSF NfL, Ng, Abeta42, T-tau, or P-tau with risk of MCI after adjusting for sex, education, apolipoprotein E genotype, and the Charlson comorbidity index. To examine CSF Abeta42 as an effect modifier, it was categorized into tertiles; the bottom tertile was defined as having elevated brain amyloid. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risk of MCI. Results: At baseline, the median age of the 648 participants without cognitive impairment was 72.3 years (range, 50.7-95.3 years) and 366 (56.5%) were men; 96 (14.8%) developed incident MCI. Compared with the bottom quartile, the top quartile of CSF NfL was associated with a 3.1-fold increased risk of MCI (hazard ratio, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.36-7.18) in multivariate models. Neither CSF T-tau, P-tau, nor Ng was associated with risk of MCI. There was no interaction between Abeta42 and CSF NfL for risk of MCI. Conclusions and Relevance: Elevated CSF NfL levels but not CSF T-tau, P-tau or Ng are a risk factor for MCI in a community population and are independent of brain amyloid.",

METHODS: We developed a set of immunoassays to measure tau in specimens from humans diagnosed based on current best clinical and CSF biomarker criteria. RESULTS: In CSF, mid-region- and N-terminal-detected tau predominated and rose in disease. In plasma, an N-terminal assay (NT1) detected elevated levels of tau in AD and AD-mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Plasma NT1 measurements separated controls from AD-MCI (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.88) and AD (AUC = 0.96) in a discovery cohort and in a Validation Cohort (with AUCs = 0.79 and 0.75, respectively). DISCUSSION: The forms of tau in CSF and plasma are distinct, but in each specimen type, the levels of certain fragments are increased in AD. Measurement of plasma NT1 tau should be aggressively pursued as a potential blood-based screening test for AD/AD-MCI.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and the most common phenotype of dementia. Trigonelline is an alkaloid found in medicinal plants such as fenugreek seeds and coffee beans with neuroprotective potential and according to existing evidences, a favorable agent for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, the possible protective effect of trigonelline against intracerebral Abeta(1-40) as a model of AD in the rat was investigated. For induction of AD, aggregated A(1-40) (10 mug/2  l for each side) was bilaterally microinjected into the hippocampal CA1 area. Trigonelline was administered p.o. at a dose of 100 mg/kg. The results showed that trigonelline pretreatment of Abeta-microinjected rats significantly improves spatial recognition memory in Y maze and performance in novel object recognition (NOR) task, mitigates hippocampal malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and improves mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) with no significant change of catalase activity, nitrite level, caspase 3 activity, and DNA fragmentation. Additionally, trigonelline ameliorated hippocampal levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S100b, cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) with no significant alteration of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). In addition, trigonelline pretreatment prevented loss of hippocampal CA1 neurons in Abeta-microinjected group. Therefore, our results suggest that trigonelline pretreatment in Abeta model of AD could improve cognition and is capable to alleviate neuronal loss through suppressing oxidative stress, astrocyte activity, and inflammation and also through preservation of mitochondrial integrity.",

    "abstract": "Brain accumulation and aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is a critical step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Full-length Abeta peptides (mainly Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42) are produced through sequential proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. However, studies of autopsy brain samples from AD patients have demonstrated that a large fraction of insoluble Abeta peptides are truncated at the N-terminus, with Abeta4-x peptides being particularly abundant. Abeta4-x peptides are highly aggregation prone, but their origin and any proteases involved in their generation are unknown. We have identified a recognition site for the secreted metalloprotease ADAMTS4 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 4) in the Abeta peptide sequence, which facilitates Abeta4-x peptide generation. Inducible overexpression of ADAMTS4 in HEK293 cells resulted in the secretion of Abeta4-40 but unchanged levels of Abeta1-x peptides. In the 5xFAD mouse model of amyloidosis, Abeta4-x peptides were present not only in amyloid plaque cores and vessel walls, but also in white matter structures co-localized with axonal APP. In the ADAMTS4-/- knockout background, Abeta4-40 levels were reduced confirming a pivotal role of ADAMTS4 in vivo. Surprisingly, in the adult murine brain, ADAMTS4 was exclusively expressed in oligodendrocytes. Cultured oligodendrocytes secreted a variety of Abeta species, but Abeta4-40 peptides were absent in cultures derived from ADAMTS4-/- mice indicating that the enzyme was essential for Abeta4-x production in this cell type. These findings establish an enzymatic mechanism for the generation of Abeta4-x peptides. They further identify oligodendrocytes as a source of these highly amyloidogenic Abeta peptides.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: As anti-amyloid therapeutic interventions shift from enrolling patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia to individuals with pre-clinical disease, the need for sensitive measures that allow for non-invasive, fast, disseminable, and cost-effective identification of preclinical status increases in importance. The recency ratio (Rr) is a memory measure that relies on analysis of serial position performance, which has been found to predict cognitive decline and conversion to early mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The aim of this study was to test Rr's sensitivity to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the core AD biomarkers in individuals with MCI-AD and controls. METHODS: Baseline data from 126 (110 controls and 16 MCI-AD) participants from the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center were analysed. Partial correlations adjusting for demographics were carried out between CSF measure of amyloid beta (Abeta40, Abeta42, and the 40/42 ratio) and tau (total and phosphorylated), and memory measures (Rr, delayed recall, and total recall) derived from the Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test. RESULTS: Results indicated that Rr was the most sensitive memory score to Abeta42 levels in MCI-AD, while no memory score correlated significantly with any biomarker in controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that Rr is a sensitive cognitive index of underlying amyloid beta pathology in MCI-AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible brain disorder. Recent studies revealed the pivotal role of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in AD. However, there is no conclusive indication that the existing therapeutic strategies exerted any effect on the mitigation of Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and the elimination of Abeta aggregates simultaneously in vivo. Herein, we developed a novel nanocomposite that can eliminate toxic Abeta aggregates and mitigate Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in AD mice. This nanocomposite was designed to be a small-sized particle (14 +- 4 nm) with Abeta-binding peptides (KLVFF) integrated on the surface. The nanocomposite was prepared by wrapping a protein molecule with a cross-linked KLVFF-containing polymer layer synthesized by in situ polymerization. The presence of the nanocomposite remarkably changed the morphology of Abeta aggregates, which led to the formation of Abeta/nanocomposite coassembled nanoclusters instead of Abeta oligomers. With the reduction of the pathological Abeta oligomers, the nanocomposites attenuated the Abeta-induced neuron damages, regained endocranial microglia's capability to phagocytose Abeta, and eventually protected hippocampal neurons against apoptosis. Thus, we anticipate that the small-sized nanocomposite will potentially offer a feasible strategy in the development of novel AD treatments.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment represents one of the largest unmet medical needs. Developing small molecules targeting Abeta aggregation is an effective approach to prevent and treat AD. Here, we show that gallic acid (GA), a naturally occurring polyphenolic small molecule rich in grape seeds and fruits, has the capacity to alleviate cognitive decline of APP/PS1 transgenic mouse through reduction of Abeta1-42 aggregation and neurotoxicity. Oral administration of GA not only improved the spatial reference memory and spatial working memory of 4-month-old APP/PS1 mice, but also significantly reduced the more severe deficits developed in the 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice in terms of spatial learning, reference memory, short-term recognition and spatial working memory. The hippocampal long-term-potentiation (LTP) was also significantly elevated in the GA-treated 9-month-old APP/PS1 mice with increased expression of synaptic marker proteins. Evidence from atomic force microscopy (AFM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence densitometry analyses showed that GA significantly reduces Abeta1-42 aggregation both in vitro and in vivo. Further, pre-incubating GA with oligomeric Abeta1-42 reduced Abeta1-42-mediated intracellular calcium influx and neurotoxicity. Molecular docking studies identified that the 3,4,5-hydroxyle groups of GA were essential in noncovalently stabilizing GA binding to the Lys28-Ala42 salt bridge and the -COOH group is critical for disrupting the salt bridge of Abeta1-42. The predicated covalent interaction through Schiff-base formation between the carbonyl group of the oxidized product and epsilon-amino group of Lys16 is also critical for the disruption of Abeta1-42 S-shaped triple-beta-motif and toxicity. Together, these studies demonstrated that GA can be further developed as a drug to treat AD through disrupting the formation of Abeta1-42 aggregation.",

    "abstract": "The CD40 pathway has been implicated in microglial activation, which is considered as a key factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the association of CSF CD40 and synaptic degeneration in living human is not clear. A total of 294 subjects with different severities of cognitive impairments were included in this study: 84 participants with normal cognition, 143 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 67 patients with mild AD. Levels of CD40 in CSF were compared among the three groups. Further, several linear regression models were conducted to explore the associations of CSF CD40 and neurogranin levels (reflecting synaptic degeneration) when controlling for age, gender, educational attainment, APOE4 genotype, clinical diagnosis, CSF Abeta42 and tau proteins. We found that CSF CD40 levels were significantly decreased in patients with mild AD compared with healthy controls and MCI patients (control vs. AD, p = 0.0026; MCI vs. AD, p = 0.0268). However, there were no significant differences in CSF CD40 levels between controls and patients with MCI (p = 0.37). In addition, CSF CD40 levels were associated with neurogranin in the pooled sample when controlling for age, gender, educational attainment, APOE4 genotype and diagnosis. In summary, our findings support the notion that the CD40 pathway may contribute to an important mechanism underlying synaptic degeneration in AD.",

Here, we report a neuroimaging study correlating hippocampal deformity with regional AD and transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDA pathology burden. We used hippocampal shape analysis of ante-mortem T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging images of 42 participants from two longitudinal cohort studies conducted by the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center. Surfaces were generated for the whole hippocampus and zones approximating the underlying subfields using a previously developed automated image-segmentation pipeline. Multiple linear regression models were constructed to correlate the shape with pathology measures while accounting for covariates, with relationships mapped out onto hippocampal surface locations. A significant relationship existed between higher paired helical filaments-tau burden and inward hippocampal shape deformity in zones approximating CA1 and subiculum which persisted after accounting for coexisting pathologies. No significant patterns of inward surface deformity were associated with amyloid-beta or transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDA after including covariates. Our findings indicate that hippocampal shape deformity measures in surface zones approximating CA1 may represent a biomarker for postmortem AD pathology.",

    "title": "Time-dependent effect of oligomeric amyloid-beta (1-42)-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration in rat model of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized with an abnormal deposition of insoluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide plaques, tangles formation and synaptic dysfunction. These result in impaired functioning of neuronal circuits and alter the behavioral response owing to activation of neurotransmitter receptors. Recently, it has been implicated that Abeta influences N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation in AD; however, the molecular mechanism underlying remains unclear. Thus, emerged specific aim to study the time-course effect of oligomeric Abeta(1-42) (oAbeta1-42) on the mRNA expression of genes encoding NMDA and acetylcholine receptors in the rat model of AD. METHODS:  Aggregated forms of synthetic Abeta peptides were injected bilaterally into the intrahippocampal region of rat brain using stereotaxic surgery. Behavioral analysis was performed using eight-arm Radial Arm Maze task at the end of experimental period. Euthanized rat brain hippocampal tissue was used to study the mRNA expression of glutamatergic and cholinergic receptor using semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: oAbeta1-42 decreased the gene expression level of alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and increased the mRNA expression of NMDA receptor 2A, and -2B subunits. In particular, oAbeta1-42 aggregates increased the retention time and altered the behavioral response in rats after 15 days of injection. Further, amyloid-beta1-42 are highly expressed in 15 days after postinjection in hippocampus of adult rats. CONCLUSION: Acute exposure of oAbeta1-42 modulated differential gene expression of glutamatergic and cholinergic receptors in hippocampus of adult rats and is duration dependent reflecting changes in hippocampal circuitry system underlying learning and memory impairments.

The aim of this investigation was to show these differences in an animal model for Alzheimer's disease and to determine whether this effect is correlated to amyloid-beta-induced pathophysiological changes. Therefore, we assessed cognitive performance with the modified hole-board test in female and male Tg2576 and wild type mice at the age of 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 months and correlated these findings to the total amount of soluble amyloid-beta and insoluble amyloid deposits in the brain. Tg2576 mice perform worse than wild types. Female Tg2576 mice develop an accentuated cognitive impairment (wrong choice total) beginning at the age of 12 months compared to their male littermates. Alterations in the mice's behaviour do not show interference with these deficits. Cognitive impairment is correlated to the amount of soluble amyloid-beta and insoluble amyloid deposits in the brain in a sex-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Synaptic alterations, especially presynaptic changes, are cardinal features of neurodegenerative diseases and strongly correlate with cognitive decline. NEW METHOD: We report \"Mass Synaptometry\" for the high-dimensional analysis of individual human synaptosomes, enriched nerve terminals from brain. This method was adapted from cytometry by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CyTOF), which is commonly used for single-cell analysis of immune and blood cells. RESULT: Here we overcome challenges for single synapse analysis by optimizing synaptosome preparations, generating a 'SynTOF panel,' recalibrating acquisition settings, and applying computational analyses. Through the analysis of 390,000 individual synaptosomes, we also provide proof-of principle validation by characterizing changes in synaptic diversity in Lewy Body Disease (LBD), Alzheimer's disease and normal brain. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): Current imaging methods to study synapses in humans are capable of analyzing a limited number of synapses, and conventional flow cytometric techniques are typically restricted to fewer than 6 parameters. Our method allows for the simultaneous detection of 34 parameters from tens of thousands of individual synapses. CONCLUSION: We applied Mass Synaptometry to analyze 34 parameters simultaneously on more than 390,000 synaptosomes from 13 human brain samples. This new approach revealed regional and disease-specific changes in synaptic phenotypes, including validation of this method with the expected changes in the molecular composition of striatal dopaminergic synapses in Lewy body disease and Alzheimer's disease. Mass synaptometry enables highly parallel molecular profiling of individual synaptic terminals.",

Membrane environments appear to influence Abeta aggregation and may stabilize intermediate Abeta oligomeric states that are considered to be neurotoxic. One important role for molecular biophysics within the field of Abeta studies is to characterize the structure and dynamics of the Abeta peptide in various states, as well as the kinetics of transfer between these states. Because biological cell membranes are very complex, simplified membrane models are needed to facilitate studies of Abeta and other amyloid proteins in lipid environments. In this review, we examine different membrane-mimetic systems available for molecular studies of Abeta. An introduction to each system is given, and examples of important findings are presented for each system. The benefits and drawbacks of each system are discussed from methodical and biological perspectives.",

AD is characterized by extracellular senile plaques (SP) formed by beta amyloid (Abeta) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles in neuronal cells formed by hyperphosphorylation of tau, as well as the deficiency of neuronal with gliosis. However, the complete spectrum of regulating factors in molecular level that affect the pathogenesis of AD is unclear. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and AD. It is increasingly recognized that lncRNAs is tightly related to the pathogenesis and prevention and cure of AD.

    "abstract": "In addition to the devastating symptoms of dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of the processing products of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide precursor protein (APP). APP's non-pathogenic functions include regulating intracellular iron (Fe) homeostasis. MicroRNAs are small (~ 20 nucleotides) RNA species that instill specificity to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). In most cases, RISC inhibits mRNA translation through the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) sequence. By contrast, we report a novel activity of miR-346: specifically, that it targets the APP mRNA 5'-UTR to upregulate APP translation and Abeta production. This upregulation is reduced but not eliminated by knockdown of argonaute 2. The target site for miR-346 overlaps with active sites for an iron-responsive element (IRE) and an interleukin-1 (IL-1) acute box element. IREs interact with iron response protein1 (IRP1), an iron-dependent translational repressor. In primary human brain cultures, miR-346 activity required chelation of Fe. In addition, miR-346 levels are altered in late-Braak stage AD. Thus, miR-346 plays a role in upregulation of APP in the CNS and participates in maintaining APP regulation of Fe, which is disrupted in late stages of AD. Further work will be necessary to integrate other metals, and IL-1 into the Fe-miR-346 activity network. We, thus, propose a \"FeAR\" (Fe, APP, RNA) nexus in the APP 5'-UTR that includes an overlapping miR-346-binding site and the APP IRE. When a \"healthy FeAR\" exists, activities of miR-346 and IRP/Fe interact to maintain APP homeostasis. Disruption of an element that targets the FeAR nexus would lead to pathogenic disruption of APP translation and protein production.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that the abnormal aggregation of amyloid-beta (Alphabeta) peptide in Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins intraneuronally, within vesicles of the endosomal-lysosomal pathway where Abeta is both generated and degraded. Metalloproteases, including endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE)-1 and -2, reside within these vesicles and normally limit the accumulation of intraneuronally produced Abeta. In this study, we determined whether disruption of Abeta catabolism could trigger Abeta aggregation within neurons and increase the amount of Abeta associated with exosomes, small extracellular vesicles derived from endosomal multivesicular bodies. Using cultured cell lines, primary neurons, and organotypic brain slices from an AD mouse model, we found that pharmacological inhibition of the ECE family of metalloproteases increased intracellular and extracellular Abeta levels and promoted the intracellular formation of Abeta oligomers, a process that did not require internalization of secreted Abeta. In vivo, the accumulation of intraneuronal Abeta aggregates was accompanied by increased levels of both extracellular and exosome-associated Abeta, including oligomeric species. Neuronal exosomes were found to contain both ECE-1 and -2 activities, suggesting that multivesicular bodies are intracellular sites of Abeta degradation by these enzymes. ECE dysfunction could lead to the accumulation of intraneuronal Abeta aggregates and their subsequent release into the extracellular space via exosomes.-Pacheco-Quinto, J., Clausen, D., Perez-Gonzalez, R., Peng, H., Meszaros, A., Eckman, C.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent age related neurodegenerative disorder manifested by progressive cognitive decline and neuronal loss in the brain, yet precise etiopathology of majority of sporadic or late-onset AD cases is unknown. AD is associated with various pathological events such as Abeta deposition due to BACE-1 induced cleavage of APP, neuroinflammation, increased cholesterol synthesis, cholinergic deficit and oxidative stress. It was found that bone drug, alendronate (ALN) that cross blood brain barrier inhibits brain cholesterol synthesis and AChE enzyme activity. As cholesterol modifying agents have been supposed to alter AD like pathologies, the current study was designed to investigate the possible neuroprotective and therapeutic potential of ALN against ICV STZ induced experimental sporadic AD (SAD) in mice in a non-cholesterol dependent manner, using donepezil (5 mg/kg) as a reference standard. The preliminary study was done by molecular modelling to identify the binding affinity of ALN with BACE-1 in silico. The prevention of cognitive impairment in mice induced by ICV STZ (3 mg/kg) infused on first and third day, by ALN (1.76 mg/kg p.o.) administered for 15 consecutive days was assessed through Spontaneous Alternation Behavior (SAB) and Morris water maze (MWM) test. Additionally, the protective effect of ALN was also observed by the reversal of altered levels of Abeta1-42, BACE-,1 neuroinflammatory cytokines, AChE activity and oxidative stress markers (except TBARS) in ICV-STZ infused mice. However, the findings of the present study imply the therapeutic potential of ALN against SAD-like complications.",

    "abstract": "The inadvertent transmission of long incubating, untreatable and fatal neurodegenerative prionopathies, notably iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, following transplantation of cadaver-derived corneas, pituitary growth, hormones and dura mater, constitutes a historical precedent which has underpinned the application of precautionary principles to modern day advanced cell therapies. To date these have been reflected by geographic or medical history risk-based deferral of tissue donors. Emergent understanding of other prion-like proteinopathies, their potential independence from prions as a transmissible agent and the variable capability of scalably manufacturable stem cells and derivatives to take up and clear or to propagate prions, substantiate further commitment to qualifying neurodegenerative proteinopathy transmission risks. This is especially so for those involving direct or facilitated access to a recipient's brain or connected visual or nervous system such as for the treatment of stroke, retinal and adult onset neurodegenerative diseases, treatments for which have already commenced. In this review, we assess the prospective global dissemination of advanced cell therapies founded on transplantation or exposure to allogeneic human cells, recap lessons learned from the historical precedents of CJD transmission and review recent advances and current limits in understanding of prion and other neurodegenerative disease prion-like susceptibility and transmission. From these we propose grounds for a reassessment of the risks of emergent advanced cell therapies to transmit neuroproteinopathies and suggestions to ACT developers and regulators for risk mitigation and extension of criteria for deferrals.",

Oxymatrine (OMT) inhibits oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the effect of OMT on Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity in vivo and in vitro. In the Morris water maze test, OMT significantly decreased escape latency and increased the number of platform crossings. In vitro, OMT markedly increased cell viability and superoxide dismutase activity. Moreover, OMT decreased lactate dehydrogenase leakage, malondialdehyde content, and reactive oxygen species in a dose-dependent manner. OMT upregulated the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and downregulated the level of caspase-3. Furthermore, OMT inhibited the activation of MAP kinase (ERK 1/2, JNK) and nuclear factor kappaB. In summary, OMT may potentially be used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between serum soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), a soluble type of an innate immune receptor expressed on the microglia, and the risk of dementia. METHODS: A total of 1,349 Japanese community residents aged 60 and older without dementia were followed prospectively for 10 years (2002-2012). Serum sTREM2 levels were quantified by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and divided into quartiles. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of serum sTREM2 levels on the risk of dementia. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 300 subjects developed all-cause dementia; 193 had Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 85 had vascular dementia (VaD). The age- and sex-adjusted incidences of all-cause dementia, AD, and VaD elevated significantly with higher serum sTREM2 levels (all p for trend < 0.012). These associations were not altered after adjustment for confounding factors, including high-sensitive C-reactive protein. Subjects with the highest quartile of serum sTREM2 levels had significantly higher multivariable-adjusted risks of developing all-cause dementia, AD, and VaD than those with the lowest quartile (HR = 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39-2.97, p < 0.001 for all-cause dementia; HR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.02-2.55, p = 0.04 for AD; HR = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.35-6.02, p = 0.006 for VaD). No significant heterogeneity in the association of serum sTREM2 levels with the development of dementia was observed among the other risk factor subgroups (all p for heterogeneity > 0.11). INTERPRETATION: The present findings suggest a significant association between increased serum sTREM2 levels and the risk of developing all-cause dementia, AD, and VaD in the general elderly Japanese population.

    "abstract": "Transgenic Tg2576 mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) with the Swedish mutation are among the most frequently used animal models to study the amyloid pathology related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The transgene expression in this model is considered to be neuron-specific. Using a novel hAPP-specific antibody in combination with cell type-specific markers for double immunofluorescent labelings and laser scanning microscopy, we here report that-in addition to neurons throughout the brain-astrocytes in the corpus callosum and to a lesser extent in neocortex express hAPP. This astrocytic hAPP expression is already detectable in young Tg2576 mice before the onset of amyloid pathology and still present in aged Tg2576 mice with robust amyloid pathology in neocortex, hippocampus, and corpus callosum. Surprisingly, hAPP immunoreactivity in cortex is restricted to resting astrocytes distant from amyloid plaques but absent from reactive astrocytes in close proximity to amyloid plaques. In contrast, neither microglial cells nor oligodendrocytes of young or aged Tg2576 mice display hAPP labeling. The astrocytic expression of hAPP is substantiated by the analyses of hAPP mRNA and protein expression in primary cultures derived from Tg2576 offspring. We conclude that astrocytes, in particular in corpus callosum, may contribute to amyloid pathology in Tg2576 mice and thus mimic this aspect of AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "The main component of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), the brain of these patients is characterized by deposits in the parenchyma and cerebral blood vessels known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). On the other hand, the platelets are the major source of the Abeta peptide in circulation and once secreted can activate the platelets and endothelial cells producing the secretion of several inflammatory mediators that finally end up unchaining the CAA and later AD. In the present study we demonstrate that cAMP/PKA pathway plays key roles in the regulation of calpain activation and secretion of Abeta in human platelets. We confirmed that inhibition of platelet functionality occurred when platelets were incubated with forskolin (molecule that rapidly increased cAMP levels). In this sense we found that platelets pre-incubated with forskolin (20 muM) present a complete inhibition of calpain activity and this effect is reversed using an inhibitor of protein kinase A. Consequentially, when platelets were inhibited by forskolin a reduction in the processing of the APP with the consequent decrease in the Abeta peptide secretion was observed. Therefore our study provides novel insight in relation to the mechanism of processing and release of the Abeta peptide from human platelets.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular deposits of fibrillary beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in the brain that initiate an inflammatory process resulting in neurodegeneration. The neuronal loss associated with AD results in gross atrophy of affected regions causing a progressive loss of cognitive ability and memory function, ultimately leading to dementia. Growing evidence suggests that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) could be beneficial for various neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. The study investigated the effects of VIP on 5xFAD, a transgenic mouse model of AD. Toward this aim, we used 20 5xFAD mice in two groups (n = 10 each), VIP-treated (25 ng/kg i.p. injection, three times per week) and saline-treated (the drug's vehicle) following the same administration regimen. Treatment started at 1 month of age and ended 2 months later. After 2 months of treatment, the mice were euthanized, their brains dissected out, and immunohistochemically stained for Abeta40 and Abeta42 on serial sections. Then, plaque analysis and stereological morphometric analysis were performed in different brain regions. Chronic VIP administration in 5xFAD mice significantly decreased the levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42 plaques in the subiculum compared to the saline treated 5xFAD mice. VIP treatment also significantly decreased Abeta40 and Abeta42 plaques in cortical areas and significantly increased the hippocampus/cerebrum and corpus callosum/cerebrum ratio but not the cerebral cortex/cerebrum ratio. In summary, we found that chronic administration of VIP significantly decreased Abeta plaques and preserved against atrophy for related brain regions in 5xFAD AD mice.",

METHODS: APs and adjacent control regions were collected from fresh-frozen brain sections using laser capture dissection. Proteins were quantitated using tag-labeling coupled high-throughput mass spectra. RESULTS: Over 4000 proteins were accurately quantified, and more than 40 were identified as highly enriched in both AD and non-AD APs, including apoE, midkine, VGFR1, and complement C4. Intriguingly, proteins including synaptic structural proteins and complement C1r, C5, and C9 were found to be upregulated in AD APs but not non-AD APs. Moreover, the proteomic pattern of AD APs was distinct from APP/PS1 APs and exhibited correlation with aging hippocampus. DISCUSSION: Our results provide new insight into AP composition. We demonstrate unexpected differences between AD, non-AD, and APP/PS1 mouse APs, which may relate to different pathological processes.",

The Abeta peptides are highly able to accumulative and produce fibrils that are placed to form these plaques in the AD. The biological action and drug delivery properties of curcumin (Cur) nanoformulation in the Alzheimer's disease therapeutics can be developed by the altering surface of the Poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) polymer and encapsulation of selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs). The morphological structure, size distributions of nanospheres, chemical interactions between the polymer and nanoformulations of synthesized curcumin and Se NPs loaded PLGA nanospheres have been studied by using the techniques of analytical instruments. The microscopic and nano observation results of synthesized Cur loaded nanospheres are exhibited that the mono-dispersed distributions of particles with spherical shaped structure. The present drug delivery system of Cur loaded Se-PLGA nanospheres could be decreases the amyloid-beta load in the brains samples of AD mice, and greatly cured the memory deficiency of the model mice. The specific binding of Cur loaded Se-PLGA nanospheres with Abeta plaques were visualized by fluorescence microscopic technique. Se-PLGA targeting delivery system to amyloid plaques might be providing the enhanced therapeutic efficacy in AD lesions, which was studied by using transgenic mice (5XFAD).

The hereditary Arctic mutation of Abeta42 (E22G) leads to increased intracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid in early-onset Alzheimer's disease. However, it remains largely unknown how the Arctic mutant variant leads to aggressive protein aggregation and increased intracellular toxicity. Here, we constructed stable cell lines expressing fluorescent-tagged wildtype (WT) and E22G Abeta42 to study the aggregation kinetics of the Arctic Abeta42 mutant peptide and its heterogeneous structural forms. Arctic-mutant peptides assemble and form fibrils at a much faster rate than WT peptides. We identified five categories of intracellular aggregate-oligomers, single fibrils, fibril bundles, clusters, and aggresomes-that underline the heterogeneity of these Abeta42 aggregates and represent the progression of Abeta42 aggregation within the cell. Fluorescence-lifetime imaging (FLIM) and 3D structural illumination microscopy (SIM) showed that all aggregate species displayed highly compact structures with strong affinity between individual fibrils. We also found that aggregates formed by Arctic mutant Abeta42 were more resistant to intracellular degradation than their WT counterparts. Our findings uncover the structural basis of the progression of Arctic mutant Abeta42 aggregation in the cell.",

Positron emission tomography (PET) ligands have been developed to detect in vivo tau pathology in AD. However, the association of AD tau pathology post mortem with in vivo tau PET retention has not been established. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the associations of tau PET with postmortem tau pathology in AD. Objective: To study the association of regional in vivo retention of the tau PET ligand [18F]flortaucipir (previously known as AV1451) with the density of tau neuropathology in the corresponding brain regions in a patient with AD. Design, Setting, and Participants: The patient was a man in his 40s with AD caused by a PSEN1 mutation. Between May 2015 and December 2016, he underwent 2 [18F]flortaucipir PET scans at Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. Postmortem analysis was performed 12 months after the last PET scan. Tau pathology was assessed using phosphorylated tau (AT8) immunohistochemistry and Gallyas silver staining. In addition to the regional total tau pathology burden, the density of tau-positive neurites and intrasomal tau tangles were quantified using a stereology-based method. Further, beta-amyloid-containing plaques were detected using 4G8 immunohistochemistry. Data were analyzed between January 2018 and August 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Regional standardized uptake value ratios of [18F]flortaucipir were compared with the amount of tau pathology in the corresponding brain areas. Results: In this patient, the clinical disease symptoms progressed rapidly in life, paralleled with an annual increase of tau PET retention of 20% to 40% in many cortical regions. Compared with postmortem immunohistochemistry, regional in vivo uptake of [18F]flortaucipir was correlated with the density of tau-positive neurites (AT8: rs = 0.87; P < .001; Gallyas: rs = 0.92; P < .001), intrasomal tau tangles (AT8: rs = 0.65; P = .01; Gallyas: rs = 0.84; P < .001), and total tau burden (AT8: rs = 0.84; P < .001; Gallyas: rs = 0.82; P < .001). No correlations between [18F]flortaucipir and beta-amyloid pathology were found. Conclusions and Relevance: These results indicate that [18F]flortaucipir PET retention is a robust in vivo measure of the total AD tau burden.",

Here, we apply a multistage, systems biology approach to elucidate the disease mechanisms in frontotemporal dementia. We identify two gene coexpression modules that are preserved in mice harboring mutations in MAPT, GRN and other dementia mutations on diverse genetic backgrounds. We bridge the species divide via integration with proteomic and transcriptomic data from the human brain to identify evolutionarily conserved, disease-relevant networks. We find that overexpression of miR-203, a hub of a putative regulatory microRNA (miRNA) module, recapitulates mRNA coexpression patterns associated with disease state and induces neuronal cell death, establishing this miRNA as a regulator of neurodegeneration. Using a database of drug-mediated gene expression changes, we identify small molecules that can normalize the disease-associated modules and validate this experimentally.

The earliest stages of TDP-43 pathobiology are not well-characterized, and whether neurodegeneration results from TDP-43 loss-of-function or aggregation remains unclear. In the behavioral variant of FTD (bvFTD), patients undergo selective dropout of von Economo neurons (VENs) and fork cells within the frontoinsular (FI) and anterior cingulate cortices. Here, we examined TDP-43 pathobiology within these vulnerable neurons in the FI across a clinical spectrum including 17 patients with sporadic bvFTD, MND, or both. In an exploratory analysis based on our initial observations, we further assessed ten patients with C9orf72-associated bvFTD/MND. VENs and fork cells showed early, disproportionate TDP-43 aggregation that correlated with anatomical and clinical severity, including loss of emotional empathy. The presence of a TDP-43 inclusion was associated with striking nuclear and somatodendritic atrophy. An intriguing minority of neurons lacked detectable nuclear TDP-43 despite the apparent absence of a cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusion. These cells showed neuronal atrophy comparable to inclusion-bearing neurons, suggesting that the loss of nuclear TDP-43 function promotes neurodegeneration, even when TDP-43 aggregation is inconspicuous or absent.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Abeta1-42 was demonstrated to have the potential to translocate into the nucleus and to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of certain neurodegeneration-related genes. This data raises the question of whether Abeta-induced neurodegeneration might include the expression of miRNAs. Thus, our aim in this study was to investigate the effects of Abeta1-42 on certain miRNAs which are related with vitamin D metabolism, neuronal differentiation, development, and memory. This question was investigated in primary cortical neurons that were treated with 10 muM Abeta and/or 10-8 M 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 at different time points by expression analysis of let-7a-5p, miR-26b-5p, miR-27b-3p, miR-31a-5p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-192-5p with qRT-PCR. Our data indicate that amyloid pathology has effects on the expression of miRNAs. Furthermore, some of these miRNAs simultaneously regulate the proteins or the enzymes involved in neuronal metabolism. The experimental setup that we used and the data we acquired supply valuable information about the miRNAs that play a part in the Abeta pathology and suggested Abeta as a counterpart of vitamin D at the crossroads of neuronal differentiation, development, and memory.",

    "abstract": "Dozens of genes have been implicated in late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but none has a defined mechanism of action in neurons. Here, we show that the risk factor Pyk2 (PTK2B) localizes specifically to neurons in adult brain. Absence of Pyk2 has no major effect on synapse formation or the basal parameters of synaptic transmission in the hippocampal Schaffer collateral pathway. However, the induction of synaptic LTD is suppressed in Pyk2-null slices. In contrast, deletion of Pyk2 expression does not alter LTP under control conditions. Of relevance for AD pathophysiology, Pyk2-/- slices are protected from amyloid-beta-oligomer (Abetao)-induced suppression of LTP in hippocampal slices. Acutely, a Pyk2 kinase inhibitor also prevents Abetao-induced suppression of LTP in WT slices. Female and male transgenic AD model mice expressing APPswe/PSEN1DeltaE9 require Pyk2 for age-dependent loss of synaptic markers and for impairment of learning and memory. However, absence of Pyk2 does not alter Abeta accumulation or gliosis. Therefore, the Pyk2 risk gene is directly implicated in a neuronal Abetao signaling pathway impairing synaptic anatomy and function.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Genetic variation at the Pyk2 (PTK2B) locus is a risk for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the pathophysiological role of Pyk2 is not clear. Here, we studied Pyk2 neuronal function in mice lacking expression with and without transgenes generating amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque pathology. Pyk2 is not required for basal synaptic transmission or LTP, but participates in LTD. Hippocampal slices lacking Pyk2 are protected from AD-related Abeta oligomer suppression of synaptic plasticity. In transgenic AD model mice, deletion of Pyk2 rescues synaptic loss and learning/memory deficits. Therefore, Pyk2 plays a central role in AD-related synaptic dysfunction mediating Abeta-triggered dysfunction.",

    "title": "Activity-Induced Amyloid-beta Oligomers Drive Compensatory Synaptic Rearrangements in Brain Circuits Controlling Memory of Presymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease Mice.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A consistent proportion of individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease show intact cognition regardless of the extensive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in their brain. Several pieces of evidence indicate that overactivation of brain regions negative for Abeta can compensate for the underactivation of Abeta-positive ones to preserve cognition, but the underlying synaptic changes are still unexplored. METHODS: Using Golgi staining, we investigate how dendritic spines rearrange following contextual fear conditioning (CFC) in the hippocampus and amygdala of presymptomatic Tg2576 mice, a genetic model for Abeta accumulation. A molecular biology approach combined with intrahippocampal injection of a gamma-secretase inhibitor evaluates the impact of Abeta fluctuations on spine rearrangements. RESULTS: Encoding of CFC increases Abeta oligomerization in the hippocampus but not in the amygdala of Tg2576 mice. The presence of Abeta oligomers predicts vulnerability to network dysfunctions, as low c-Fos activation and spine maturation are detected in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice upon recall of CFC memory. Rather, enhanced c-Fos activation and new spines are evident in the amygdala of Tg2576 mice compared with wild-type control mice. Preventing Abeta increase in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice restores CFC-associated spine changes to wild-type levels in both the hippocampus and amygdala. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides the first evidence of neural compensation consisting of enhanced synaptic activity in brain regions spared by Abeta load. Furthermore, it unravels an activity-mediated feedback loop through which neuronal activation during CFC encoding favors Abeta oligomerization in the hippocampus and prevents synaptic rearrangements in this region.",

Recently, lignans and phenylpropanoids are attracting increasing attention to discovery useful agents of inhibition on Abeta aggregation. In the present study, to develop potential agents for slowing the progression of AD, Prunus tomentosa seeds were selected as a raw material for bioactive compounds, which led to the separation of two pairs of new enantiomeric lignans and phenylpropanoids using chiral HPLC. The planar structures of these compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic data analyses. And their absolute configurations were determined by comparing of experimental and calculated electronic circular dichroism (ECD). The biosynthesis pathway was also discussed. Additionally, the inhibitory activity on Abeta aggregation of all optical pure compounds was tested by thioflavin T (ThT) assay. The isolates (1a, 1b, 2a and 2b) showed more potent inhibitory activity than positive control curcumin with inhibitory rate of 73.89 +- 3.41% 78.69 +- 1.50%, 63.25 +- 2.68%, and 67.13 +- 0.90% at 20 muM, respectively.

Progressive cerebral accumulation of Abeta protein was widely proposed to explain the cause of Alzheimer's disease, for which one promising direction of the preclinical study is to convert the preformed beta-sheet structure of Abeta aggregates into innocent structures. However, the conversion is even harder than the modulation of the amyloidosis process. Herein, a graphene oxide/carbon nitride composite was developed as a good photocatalyst for irreversibly disassembling the Abeta aggregates of Abeta(33-42) under UV. Quartz crystal microbalance, circular dichroism spectrum, atomic force microscopy, fluorescent spectra, and mechanical property analysis were performed to analyze this photodegradation process from different aspects for fully understanding the mechanism, which may provide an important enlightenment for the relevant research in this field and neurodegenerative disease study.",

The development of radiolabeled positron emission tomography (PET) ligands for amyloid plaques and tau tangles enables the longitudinal assessment of the spatial pattern of their accumulation in relation to symptomatology. Recent work indicates that amyloid pathology develops 15-20 years before neurodegeneration and symptom onset in the sporadic and autosomal dominant forms of AD, while tau pathology correlates more closely with symptomatic stages evidenced by cognitive decline and dementia. Recent work on AD biomarkers in DS illustrates similarities between DS and sporadic AD.

The present work was carried out to extend and design a novel quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model on inhibition efficiency of some of new 2-arylethenylquinoline derivatives against the Abeta1-42 peptide aggregation. The QSAR study, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to explore the influence of the structural features and investigate the molecular mechanism of ligands interactions with the Abeta1-42 peptide. Using molecular docking was understood that electron donating groups with small size help to create interactions between the ligands and peptide residues to stabilize the conformation of ligands at the binding pocket. QSAR model was developed using the most stable conformations and parameters that obtained from the molecular docking. It is shown that, a combination of docking parameters and structural descriptors of inhibitor compounds can describe the inhibition efficiency on Abeta1-42 peptide. The model exhibited statistically significant results so that the coefficient of determination R2train, Q2LOO, R2ext and GH (goodness of hit) are 0.912, 0.915, 0.836 and 0.804, respectively. The stability and binding modes of the compounds 1 and 13 with the most inhibition efficiency and compounds 12 and 36 with the lowest inhibition efficiency were determined by molecular dynamics simulations in GROMACS package. It is showed that interactions of compounds 1 and 13 are stable after 25ns of trajectories.

The plasma membrane is considered the major site for alpha-secretase-mediated APP cleavage, but other cellular locations have not been rigorously investigated. Here, we report that APP is processed by endogenous alpha-secretase at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) of both transfected HeLa cells and mouse primary neurons. We have previously shown the adaptor protein complex, AP-4, and small G protein ADP-ribosylation factor-like GTPase 5b (Arl5b) are required for efficient post-Golgi transport of APP to endosomes. We found here that AP-4 or Arl5b depletion results in Golgi accumulation of APP and increased secretion of the soluble alpha-secretase cleavage product sAPPalpha. Moreover, inhibition of gamma-secretase following APP accumulation in the TGN increases the levels of the membrane-bound C-terminal fragments of APP from both alpha-secretase cleavage (alpha-CTF, named C83 according to its band size) and BACE1 cleavage (beta-CTF/C99). The level of C83 was ~4 times higher than that of C99, indicating that alpha-secretase processing is the major pathway and that BACE1 processing is the minor pathway in the TGN. AP-4 silencing in mouse primary neurons also resulted in the accumulation of endogenous APP in the TGN and enhanced alpha-secretase processing. These findings identify the TGN as a major site for alpha-secretase processing in HeLa cells and primary neurons and indicate that both APP processing pathways can occur within the TGN compartment along the secretory pathway.",

Immunoassays were applied to soluble brain fractions from pathologically confirmed subjects (81 AD patients, 33 controls), CSF from three cross-sectional and two longitudinal cohorts (a total of 133 AD, 38 MCI, 20 MCI-AD, 31 PSP, 15 CBS patients, and 91 controls), and neuronally- and peripherally-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs and PDEVs, respectively) in serum from four AD patients and four controls. Anti-tau 224 antibody stained neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, while anti-tau 123 only showed weak cytoplasmic staining in AD. N-224 tau was lower in the AD soluble brain fraction compared to controls, while N-123 tau showed similar levels. N-224 tau was higher in AD compared to controls in all CSF cohorts (p < 0.001), but not N-123 tau. Decrease in cognitive performance and conversion from MCI to AD were associated with increased baseline CSF levels of N-224 tau (p < 0.0001). N-224 tau concentrations in PSP and CBS were significantly lower than in AD (p < 0.0001) and did not correlate to t-tau and p-tau. In a longitudinal cohort, CSF N-224 tau levels were stable over 6 months, with no significant effect of treatment with AChE inhibitors. N-224 tau was present in NDEVs, while N-123 tau showed comparable concentrations in both vesicle types. We suggest that N-123 tau is produced both in CNS and PNS and represents a general marker of tau metabolism, while N-224 tau is neuron-specific, present in the tangles, secreted in CSF, and upregulated in AD, suggesting a link between tau cleavage and propagation, tangle pathology, and cognitive decline.",

In addition, evidence has suggested that EGR1 can regulate levels of amyloid-beta peptides, key molecules in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether EGR1 is a deleterious or protective factor in the AD is still controversial. In this present study, we constructed an overexpression plasmid, CMV-EGFP-EGR1-Kanamycin, and transfected it into U87MG cells to investigate the effects of EGR1 expression on amyloid-beta (1-40) peptide (Abeta40) levels. U87MG cells transfected by CMV-EGFP-EGR1-Kanamycin and CMV-EGFP-Kanamycin were assigned, respectively, to experimental and control groups. Fluorescence microscopy was used to observe transfection efficiencies of the plasmids after 6 hours. EGR1 messenger RNA levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Abeta40 secretion was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of the amyloid precursor protein, beta-secretase enzyme, and presenilin 1 proteins were analyzed by Western blot analysis. The results showed that EGR1 overexpression increased Abeta40 secretion in vitro, possibly through increasing BACE1 expression. Based on these results, EGR1 might be a promising therapeutic target for the AD.",

METHODS: Fifty-five autopsy-confirmed LBD (Parkinson disease with dementia, n = 36; dementia with Lewy bodies, n = 19) patients and 25 AD patients were studied. LBD patients were categorized as having moderate/severe AD copathology (SYN + AD = 20) or little/no AD copathology (SYN-AD = 35). Digital measures of tau, beta-amyloid (Abeta), and SYN histopathology in neocortical and subcortical/limbic regions were compared between groups and related to antemortem cognitive testing. RESULTS: SYN burden was higher in SYN + AD than SYN-AD in each neocortical region (F1, 54 = 5.6-6.0, p < 0.02) but was equivalent in entorhinal cortex and putamen (F1, 43-49 = 0.7-1.7, p > 0.2). SYN + AD performed worse than SYN-AD on a temporal lobe-mediated naming task (t27 = 2.1, p = 0.04). Antemortem cognitive test scores inversely correlated with tau burden (r = -0.39 to -0.68, p < 0.05). AD had higher tau than SYN + AD in all regions (F1, 43 = 12.8-97.2, p < 0.001); however, SYN + AD had a greater proportion of tau in the temporal neocortex than AD (t41 = 2.0, p < 0.05), whereas AD had a greater proportion of tau in the frontal neocortex than SYN + AD (t41 = 3.3, p < 0.002). SYN + AD had similar severity and distribution of neocortical Abeta compared to AD (F1, 40-43 = 1.6-2.0, p > 0.1). INTERPRETATION: LBD patients with AD copathology harbor greater neocortical SYN pathology. Regional tau pathology relates to cognitive performance in LBD dementia, and its distribution may diverge from pure AD. Tau copathology contributes uniquely to the heterogeneity of cognitive impairment in LBD. Ann Neurol 2018; 1-13 ANN NEUROL 2019;85:259-271.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42) aggregates represent a prominent histopathological feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD); thus, immunotherapy against oligomeric Abeta42 aggregates is considered to be a potentially safe and specific therapeutic strategy. In this study, we identified an anti-oligomeric Abeta42 aggregate single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody, HT6, that is capable of efficiently binding to medium-sized Abeta42 aggregates (mainly 18-45 kDa) in vitro with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 3.0 x 10-6 M, whether they were derived from Abeta42 monomer, larger Abeta42 oligomers, or even fibrils. This ability allowed scFv HT6 to induce the gradual disassembly of large Abeta42 aggregates into small Abeta42 oligomers while simultaneously effectively inhibiting the further development of Abeta42 aggregates. Moreover, the scFv HT6-targeted conformational region on Abeta42 aggregates was found to be more local and relatively close to the N-terminus of Abeta42; thus, scFv HT6 significantly delayed or even prevented the aggregation of Abeta42 protofibrils, while significantly reducing the cytotoxicity of Abeta42 oligomers. Overall, this study demonstrate that even though the decrease in the cytotoxicity of Abeta42 aggregates might be closely related to the reduction in Abeta42 aggregates and vice versa, the reduction in Abeta42 aggregates might not necessarily be accompanied by or followed by the reduction or even elimination of the cytotoxicity of Abeta42 aggregates. This insight enriches the diversity of anti-oligomeric Abeta42 antibodies, further providing a new understanding into the relationship between their binding pattern to Abeta42 aggregates and the efficacy against their formation, offering a therapeutic strategy to delay the progression of AD.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia. Thus, numerous efforts to identify chemical tactics to control the aggregation pathways of Abeta peptides have been made. Among them, transition metal complexes as a class of chemical modulators against Abeta aggregation have been designed and utilized. Transition metal complexes are able to carry out a variety of chemistry with Abeta peptides (e.g., coordination chemistry and oxidative and proteolytic reactions for peptide modifications) based on their tunable characteristics, including the oxidation state of and coordination geometry around the metal center. This Viewpoint illustrates three strategies employing transition metal complexes toward modulation of Abeta aggregation pathways (i.e., oxidation and hydrolysis of Abeta as well as coordination to Abeta), along with some examples of such transition metal complexes. In addition, proposed mechanisms for three reactivities of transition metal complexes with Abeta peptides are discussed. Our greater understanding of how transition metal complexes have been engineered and used for alteration of Abeta aggregation could provide insight into the new discovery of chemical reagents against Abeta peptides found in AD.",

    "abstract": "beta-Amyloid pathology is elevated in ~30% of cognitively normal people over 65, and is associated with accelerated neurodegeneration in the pre-clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease. Recent findings reveal that brain iron might also act to propel neurodegeneration in people with underlying amyloid pathology. Here, repeated PET scans of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) were used as a biomarker for brain hypometabolism and a downstream biomarker of neurodegeneration to investigate whether levels of ferritin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; a reporter of brain iron load) are associated with prodromal disease progression of people with high beta-amyloid pathology determined by established cut-off values in CSF t-tau/Abeta42 ratio. Nineteen cognitively normal participants with low t-tau/Abeta42, and 71 participants with high t-tau/Abeta42 who were cognitively normal or had mild cognitive impairment were included as participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. These subjects had repeated FDG-PET scans at 6-month intervals for 2 years, and yearly intervals for up to a further 3 years. In mixed-effects linear models of FDG signal, baseline CSF ferritin was associated with an accelerated decline in FDG PET in high t-tau/Abeta42 participants (beta[SE] = -0.066 [0.017]; P = .0002), but not in people with low t-tau/Abeta42 (-0.029 [0.049]; P = .554). These data implicate iron as a contributing factor to neurodegeneration associated with beta-amyloid pathology, and highlight CSF ferritin as a complementary prognostic biomarker to the t-tau/Abeta42 ratio that predicts near-term risk for disease progression.",

Here we report that pathological tau accumulation takes place predominantly in excitatory neurons compared to inhibitory neurons, not only in the entorhinal cortex, a brain region affected in early Alzheimer's disease, but also in areas affected later by the disease. By analyzing RNA transcripts from single-nucleus RNA datasets, we identified a specific tau homeostasis signature of genes differentially expressed in excitatory compared to inhibitory neurons. One of the genes, BCL2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3), a facilitator of autophagy, was identified as a hub, or master regulator, gene. We verified that reducing BAG3 levels in primary neurons exacerbated pathological tau accumulation, whereas BAG3 overexpression attenuated it. These results define a tau homeostasis signature that underlies the cellular and regional vulnerability of excitatory neurons to tau pathology.",

    "abstract": "The coexistence of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the neocortex is linked to neural system failure and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are unknown. By employing in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging of layer 2/3 cortical neurons in mice expressing human Abeta and tau, we reveal a dramatic tau-dependent suppression of activity and silencing of many neurons, which dominates over Abeta-dependent neuronal hyperactivity. We show that neurofibrillary tangles are neither sufficient nor required for the silencing, which instead is dependent on soluble tau. Surprisingly, although rapidly effective in tau mice, suppression of tau gene expression was much less effective in rescuing neuronal impairments in mice containing both Abeta and tau. Together, our results reveal how Abeta and tau synergize to impair the functional integrity of neural circuits in vivo and suggest a possible cellular explanation contributing to disappointing results from anti-Abeta therapeutic trials.",

Different phenotypes and functions have been ascribed to rodent microglia, but little is known about human microglia (huMG) heterogeneity. Difficulties in procuring huMG and their susceptibility to cryopreservation damage have limited large-scale studies. Here we applied multiplexed mass cytometry for a comprehensive characterization of postmortem huMG (103 - 104 cells). We determined expression levels of 57 markers on huMG isolated from up to five different brain regions of nine donors. We identified the phenotypic signature of huMG, which was distinct from peripheral myeloid cells but was comparable to fresh huMG. We detected microglia regional heterogeneity using a hybrid workflow combining Cytobank and R/Bioconductor for multidimensional data analysis. Together, these methodologies allowed us to perform high-dimensional, large-scale immunophenotyping of huMG at the single-cell level, which facilitates their unambiguous profiling in health and disease.",

We conducted an epigenome-wide association study using the histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) mark in 669 aged human prefrontal cortices; in contrast with amyloid-beta, tau protein burden had a broad effect on the epigenome, affecting 5,990 of 26,384 H3K9ac domains. Tau-related alterations aggregated in large genomic segments reflecting spatial chromatin organization, and the magnitude of these effects correlated with the segment's nuclear lamina association. Functional relevance of these chromatin changes was demonstrated by (1) consistent transcriptional changes in three independent datasets and (2) similar findings in two mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we found that tau overexpression in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons altered chromatin structure and that these effects could be blocked by a small molecule predicted to reverse the tau effect.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology frequently co-occur in older adults. The extent to which cerebrovascular disease influences the progression of AD pathology remains unclear. Leveraging newly available positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we examined whether a well-validated measure of systemic vascular risk and beta-amyloid (Abeta) burden have an interactive association with regional tau burden. METHODS: Vascular risk was quantified at baseline in 152 clinically normal older adults (mean age = 73.5 +- 6.1 years) with the office-based Framingham Heart Study cardiovascular disease risk algorithm (FHS-CVD). We acquired Abeta (11 C-Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (18 F-flortaucipir) PET imaging on the same participants. Abeta PET was performed at baseline; tau PET was acquired on average 2.98 +- 1.1 years later. Tau was measured in the entorhinal cortex (EC), an early site of tau deposition, and in the inferior temporal cortex (ITC), an early site of neocortical tau accumulation associated with AD. Linear regression models examined FHS-CVD and Abeta as interactive predictors of tau deposition, adjusting for age, sex, APOE epsilon4 status, and the time interval between baseline and the tau PET scan. RESULTS: We observed a significant interaction between FHS-CVD and Abeta burden on subsequently measured ITC tau (p < 0.001), whereby combined higher FHS-CVD and elevated Abeta burden was associated with increased tau. The interaction was not significant for EC tau (p = 0.16). INTERPRETATION: Elevated vascular risk may influence tau burden when coupled with high Abeta burden. These results suggest a potential link between vascular risk and tau pathology in preclinical AD. Ann Neurol 2019; 1-8 ANN NEUROL 2019;85:272-279.",

    "title": "Amyloid beta-Peptide Interaction with Membranes: Can Chaperones Change the Fate?",
    "abstract": "The understanding of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) interactions with cellular membranes is a crucial molecular challenge against Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, Abeta prefibrillar oligomeric intermediates are believed to be the most toxic species, able to induce cellular damages directly by membrane damage. We present a neutron-scattering study on the interaction of large unilamellar vesicles (LUV), as cell membrane models, with both freshly dissolved Abeta and early toxic prefibrillar oligomers, intermediate states in the amyloid pathway. In addition, we explore the effect of coincubating the Abeta-peptide with the chaperonin Hsp60, which is known to strongly interact with it in its aggregation pattern. In fact, the interaction of the LUV with coincubated Abeta/Hsp60, right after mixing and after following the aggregation protocol leading to the toxic intermediates in the absence of Hsp60, is studied. Neutron spin echo experiments show that the interaction with both freshly dissolved and aggregate Abeta species brings about an increase in membrane stiffness, whereas the presence of even very low amounts of Hsp60 (ratio Abeta/Hsp60 = 25:1) maintains unaltered the elastic properties of the membrane bilayer. A coherent interpretation of these results, related to previous literature, can be based on the ability of the chaperonin to interfere with Abeta aggregation, by the specific recognition of the Abeta-reactive transient species. In this framework, our results strongly suggest that early in a freshly dissolved Abeta solution are present some species able to modify the bilayer dynamics, and the chaperonin plays the role of an assistant in such stochastic \"misfolding events\", avoiding the insult on the membrane as well as the onset of the aggregation cascade.",

    "abstract": "beta-Amyloid (Abeta) accumulation is an early event of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Inhibition of Abeta production by beta-secretase (BACE) has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. However, BACE inhibitors lack specificity and have had limited clinical benefit. To better study the consequences of reducing BACE metabolism, specifically of APP, we used an antibody, 2B3, that binds to APP at the BACE cleavage site, inhibiting Abeta production. 2B3 was administered either directly into the lateral ventricles or by intraperitoneal injection to (platelet-derived growth factor promoter hAPP717V (PDAPP) mice and WT mice. 2B3 reduced soluble Abeta40 and betaCTF (beta-amyloid derived C-terminal fragment) and improved memory for object-in-place associations and working memory in a foraging task in PDAPP mice. 2B3 also normalized the phosphorylation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor NR2B subunit and subsequent extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling. The importance of this NR2B pathway for OiP memory was confirmed by administering the NR2B antagonist, Ro25-6981, to 18-month-old WT. In contrast, 2B3 impaired associative recognition memory in young WT mice. These data provide novel insights into the mechanism by which selective modulation of APP metabolism by BACE influences synaptic and cognitive processes in both normal mice and aged APP transgenic mice.",

    "abstract": "Aggregated amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain are hypothesized to trigger several downstream pathologies, including cerebrovascular dysfunction. Previous studies have shown that Abeta peptides can have antiangiogenic properties, which may contribute to vascular dysfunction in the early stages of the disease process. We have generated data showing that brain endothelial cells (ECs) exposed to toxic Abeta1-42 oligomers can readily enter a senescence phenotype. To determine the effect of Abeta oligomers on brain ECs, we treated early passaged human brain microvascular ECs and HUVECs with high MW Abeta1-42 oligomers (5 microM, for 72 h). For controls, we used no peptide treatment, 5 microM Abeta1-42 monomers, and 5 microM Abeta1-42 fibrils, respectively. Brain ECs treated with Abeta1-42 oligomers showed increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining and increased senescence-associated p21/p53 expression. Treatment with either Abeta1-42 monomer or Abeta1-42 fibrils did not induce senescence in this assay. We then measured vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) expression in the Abeta1-42 oligomer-treated ECs, and these cells showed significantly increased VEGFR-1 expression and decreased VEGFR-2 levels. Overexpression of VEGFR-1 in brain ECs readily induced senescence, suggesting a direct role of VEGFR-1 signaling events in this paradigm. More importantly, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of VEGFR-1 expression in brain ECs was able to prevent up-regulation of p21 protein expression and significantly reduced induction of senescence following Abeta1-42 oligomer treatment. Our studies show that exposure to Abeta1-42 oligomers may impair vascular functions by altering VEGFR-1 expression and causing ECs to enter a senescent phenotype. Altered VEGFR expression has been documented in brains of AD patients and suggests that this pathway may play a role in AD disease pathogenesis. These studies suggest that modulating VEGFR-1 expression and signaling events could potentially prevent senescence and rejuvenate EC functions, and provides us with a novel target to pursue for prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD.-Angom, R.

    "title": "Fatty Acids Compete with Abeta in Binding to Serum Albumin by Quenching Its Conformational Flexibility.",
    "abstract": "Human serum albumin (HSA) has been identified as an important regulator of amyloid-beta (Abeta) fibrillization both in blood plasma and in cerebrospinal fluid. Fatty acids bind to HSA, and high serum levels of fatty acids increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. In vitro, fatty-acid-loaded HSA (FA HSA) loses the protective effect against Abeta fibrillization, but the mechanism underlying the interference of fatty acids on Abeta-HSA interactions has been unclear. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations to gain atomic-level insight on the weak binding of monomeric Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides with apo and FA HSA. Consistent with recent NMR data, C-terminal residues of the Abeta peptides have the highest propensities for interacting with apo HSA. Interestingly, the Abeta binding residues of apo and FA HSA exhibit distinct patterns, which qualitatively correlate with backbone flexibility. In FA HSA, both flexibilities and Abeta binding propensities are relatively even among the three domains. In contrast, in apo HSA, domain III shows the highest flexibility and is the primary target for Abeta binding. Specifically, deformation of apo HSA creates strong binding sites within subdomain IIIb, around the interface between subdomains IIIa and IIIb, and at the cleft between domains III and I. Therefore, much like disordered proteins, HSA can take advantage of flexibility in forming promiscuous interactions with partners, until the flexibility is quenched by fatty-acid binding. Our work explains the effect of fatty acids on Abeta-HSA binding and contributes to the understanding of HSA regulation of Abeta aggregation.",

    "title": "27-hydroxycholesterol promotes Abeta accumulation via altering Abeta metabolism in mild cognitive impairment patients and APP/PS1 mice.",
    "abstract": "The oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) has been considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is the pathological hallmark of AD, the aim of this study is to verify whether 27-OHC could lead to cognitive impairment through modulating Abeta accumulation and deposition. Regulation of Abeta metabolism was explored as the pathogenic mechanism of 27-OHC. Furthermore, microRNAs (miRNAs) and their relations with 27-OHC were also detected. In present study, matched case-control study and APP/PS1 transgenic mice research were conducted. The results showed that the 27-OHC and Abeta in plasma were increased in mild cognitive impairment patients, and a slight correlation was found between 27-OHC and Abeta1-40. This relationship was also proved by the research of APP/PS1 mice. More severe learning and memory impairment and higher Abeta1-40 expression in brain and plasma were detected in the APP/PS1 mice of 27-OHC treatment group. In addition, increased amyloid plaques were also found in the hippocampus of 27-OHC-treated mice. In order to find out the mechanism of 27-OHC on regulating Abeta metabolism, the factors of Abeta production (APP, BACE1 and ADAM10), transport (LRP1 and RAGE) and elimination (NEP and IDE) were tested respectively. The gene and protein expressions of APP, BACE1 and RAGE were increased while LRP1 and IDE were decreased in the brain of 27-OHC-treated mice. At last, down-regulated expression of miRNA let-7g-5p was found after 27-OHC treatment. In conclusion, these findings suggested that excessive 27-OHC could enhance the accumulation and deposition of Abeta both in brain and blood, resulting in a severe impairment of cognition, especially in the modulation of Abeta1-40. The mechanism might be associated with the regulation of Abeta metabolism, and miRNA let-7g-5p was likely to play a vital role in this pathological process induced by 27-OHC.",

    "title": "Oligopeptides Generated by Neprilysin Degradation of beta-Amyloid Have the Highest Cu(II) Affinity in the Whole Abeta Family.",
    "abstract": "The catabolism of beta-amyloid (Abeta) is carried out by numerous endopeptidases including neprilysin, which hydrolyzes peptide bonds preceding positions 4, 10, and 12 to yield Abeta4-9 and a minor Abeta12- x species. Alternative processing of the amyloid precursor protein by beta-secretase also generates the Abeta11- x species. All these peptides contain a Xxx-Yyy-His sequence, also known as an ATCUN or NTS motif, making them strong chelators of Cu(II) ions. We synthesized the corresponding peptides, Phe-Arg-His-Asp-Ser-Gly-OH (Abeta4-9), Glu-Val-His-His-Gln-Lys-am (Abeta11-16), Val-His-His-Gln-Lys-am (Abeta12-16), and pGlu-Val-His-His-Gln-Lys-am (pAbeta11-16), and investigated their Cu(II) binding properties using potentiometry, and UV-vis, circular dichroism, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies. We found that the three peptides with unmodified N-termini formed square-planar Cu(II) complexes at pH 7.4 with analogous geometries but significantly varied Kd values of 6.6 fM (Abeta4-9), 9.5 fM (Abeta12-16), and 1.8 pM (Abeta11-16). Cyclization of the N-terminal Glu11 residue to the pyroglutamate species pAbeta11-16 dramatically reduced the affinity (5.8 nM). The Cu(II) affinities of Abeta4-9 and Abeta12-16 are the highest among the Cu(II) complexes of Abeta peptides. Using fluorescence spectroscopy, we demonstrated that the Cu(II) exchange between the Phe-Arg-His and Val-His-His motifs is very slow, on the order of days. These results are discussed in terms of the relevance of Abeta4-9, a major Cu(II) binding Abeta fragment generated by neprilysin, as a possible Cu(II) carrier in the brain.",

The present study explored the role of epigenetic modifiers and Abeta degradation enzymes in Pb-induced latent effects on Abeta overproduction in vitro. Our results indicated that in SH-SY5Y cells exposed to Pb, the expression of NEP and IDE remained declined during the recovery period, accompanied with abnormal increase of Abeta1-42 and amyloid oligomer. A disruption of selective global post-translational histone modifiers including the decrease of H3K9ac and H4K12ac and the induction of H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 dose dependently was also showed in recovery cells. Moreover, histone deacetylase inhibitor VPA could attenuate latent Abeta accumulation and HDAC activity induced by Pb, which might be by regulating the expression of NEP and IDE epigenetically. Overall, our results suggest sustained reduction of NEP and IDE expression in response to Pb sensitizes recovery SH-SY5Y cells to Abeta accumulation; however, administration of VPA is demonstrated to be beneficial in modulating Abeta clearance.",

To test the hypothesis that incorporating genetic diversity into mouse models of AD would improve translational potential, we combined a well-established mouse model of AD with a genetically diverse reference panel to generate mice that harbor identical high-risk human mutations but differ across the remainder of their genome. We first show that genetic variation profoundly modifies the impact of human AD mutations on both cognitive and pathological phenotypes. We then validate this complex AD model by demonstrating high degrees of genetic, transcriptomic, and phenotypic overlap with human AD. Overall, work here both introduces a novel AD mouse population as an innovative and reproducible resource for the study of mechanisms underlying AD and provides evidence that preclinical models incorporating genetic diversity may better translate to human disease.",

    "abstract": "MMP13 (matrix metallopeptidase 13) plays a key role in bone metabolism and cancer development, but has no known functions in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we used high-throughput small molecule screening in SH-SY5Y cells that stably expressed a luciferase reporter gene driven by the BACE1 (beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1) promoter, which included a portion of the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR). We identified that CL82198, a selective inhibitor of MMP13, decreased BACE1 protein levels in cultured neuronal cells. This effect was dependent on PI3K (phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase) signalling, and was unrelated to BACE1 gene transcription and protein degradation. Further, we found that eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) played a key role, as the mutation of eIF4B at serine 422 (S422R) or deletion of the BACE1 5'UTR attenuated MMP13-mediated BACE1 regulation. In APPswe/PS1E9 mice, an animal model of Alzheimer's disease, hippocampal Mmp13 knockdown or intraperitoneal CL82198 administration reduced BACE1 protein levels and the related amyloid-beta precursor protein processing, amyloid-beta load and eIF4B phosphorylation, whereas spatial and associative learning and memory performances were improved. Collectively, MMP13 inhibition/CL82198 treatment exhibited therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's disease, via the translational regulation of BACE1.",

Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human gamma-secretase in complex with a Notch fragment at a resolution of 2.7 A. The transmembrane helix of Notch is surrounded by three transmembrane domains of PS1, and the carboxyl-terminal beta-strand of the Notch fragment forms a beta-sheet with two substrate-induced beta-strands of PS1 on the intracellular side. Formation of the hybrid beta-sheet is essential for substrate cleavage, which occurs at the carboxyl-terminal end of the Notch transmembrane helix.

In this work, we analyzed this interaction independently of the overexpression of an FTDP-17 mutant tau, by analyzing tau pathology in wild-type (WT), 5xFAD, APP-/- and tau-/- mice after stereotaxic injection in the somatosensory cortex of short-length native human AD-PHF. Gallyas and phosphotau-positive tau inclusions developed in WT, 5xFAD, and APP-/- but not in tau-/- mice. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrated their intracellular localization and that they were composed of straight filaments. These seeded tau inclusions were composed only of endogenous murine tau exhibiting a tau antigenic profile similar to tau aggregates in AD. Insoluble tau level was higher and ipsilateral anteroposterior and contralateral cortical spreading of tau inclusions was more important in AD-PHF-injected 5xFAD mice than in WT mice. The formation of large plaque-associated dystrophic neurites positive for oligomeric and phosphotau was observed in 5xFAD mice injected with AD-PHF but never in control-injected or in non-injected 5xFAD mice. An increased level of the p25 activator of CDK5 kinase was found in AD-PHF-injected 5xFAD mice. These data demonstrate in vivo that the presence of Abeta pathology enhances experimentally induced tau seeding of endogenous, wild-type tau expressed at physiological level, and demonstrate the fibrillar nature of heterotopically seeded endogenous tau. These observations further support the hypothesis that Abeta enhances tau pathology development in AD through increased pathological tau spreading.",

    "title": "Metal-Organic Frameworks Harness Cu Chelating and Photooxidation Against Amyloid beta Aggregation in Vivo.",
    "abstract": "Recently, photooxygenation of amyloid beta (Abeta) has emerged as an effective way to inhibit Abeta aggregation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. However, their further application has been highly obstructed by self-aggregation, no metal chelating ability, and poor protein-enrichment capacity. Herein, porphyrinic metal-organic frameworks (PMOFs) are utilized as a superior CuII chelating and photooxidation agent for inhibiting Abeta aggregation. We selected only four classical kinds of POMFs (Zr-MOF, Al-MOF, Ni-MOF, Hf-MOF) for further investigation in our study, which are stable in physiological conditions and exhibit excellent biocompatibility. Among them, Hf-MOF was the most efficient Abeta photooxidant. A possible explanation about the difference in capacity of 1 O2 generation of these four PMOFs has been provided according to the experimental results and DFT calculations. Furthermore, Hf-MOFs are modified with Abeta-targeting peptide, LPFFD. This can not only enhance Hf-MOFs targeting cellular Abeta to decrease Abeta-induced cytotoxicity, but also improve Abeta photooxidation in the complicated living environment. More intriguingly, in vivo studies indicate that the well-designed LPFFD modified Hf-MOFs can decrease Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and extend the longevity of the commonly used transgenic AD model Caenorhabditis elegans CL2006. Our work may open a new avenue for using MOFs as neurotoxic-metal-chelating and photo-therapeutic agents for AD treatment.",

Moreover, conventional mutation correction by gene-editing would only be relevant for the small fraction of neurodegenerative cases that are inherited. Here we introduce a CRISPR/Cas9-based strategy in cell and animal models to edit endogenous amyloid precursor protein (APP) at the extreme C-terminus and reciprocally manipulate the amyloid pathway, attenuating APP-beta-cleavage and Abeta production, while up-regulating neuroprotective APP-alpha-cleavage. APP N-terminus and compensatory APP-homologues remain intact, with no apparent effects on neurophysiology in vitro. Robust APP-editing is seen in human iPSC-derived neurons and mouse brains with no detectable off-target effects. Our strategy likely works by limiting APP and BACE-1 approximation, and we also delineate mechanistic events that abrogates APP/BACE-1 convergence in this setting. Our work offers conceptual proof for a selective APP silencing strategy.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in parietal and temporal white matter microstructure derived from diffusion tensor imaging occur in preclinical and clinical Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition and such white matter alterations are two pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. However, the relationship between these pathologies is not yet understood, partly since conventional diffusion MRI methods cannot distinguish between cellular and extracellular processes. Thus, we studied Abeta-associated longitudinal diffusion MRI changes in Abeta-positive (N = 21) and Abeta-negative (N = 51) cognitively normal elderly obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset using linear mixed models. Abeta-positivity was based on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative amyloid-PET recommendations using a standardized uptake value ratio cut-off of 1.11. We used free-water imaging to distinguish cellular and extracellular changes. We found that Abeta-positive subjects had increased baseline right uncinate fasciculus free-water fraction (FW), associated with worse baseline Alzheimer's disease assessment scale scores. Furthermore, Abeta-positive subjects showed faster decrease in fractional anisotropy (FW-corrected) in the right uncinate fasciculus and faster age-dependent right inferior longitudinal fasciculus FW increases over time. Right inferior longitudinal fasciculus FW increases were associated with greater memory decline. Importantly, these results remained significant after controlling for gray and white matter volume and hippocampal volume. This is the first study to illustrate the influence of Abeta burden on early longitudinal (in addition to baseline) white matter changes in cognitively normal elderly individuals at-risk of Alzheimer's disease, thus underscoring the importance of longitudinal studies in assessing microstructural alterations in individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease prior to symptoms onset.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) molecule is a type I transmembrane protein that is crucial for survival, cell-cell adhesion, neuronal development, myelination, cancer metastasis, modulation of metal, and glucose and insulin homeostasis. Moreover, the importance of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) family in biology and disease is very well known because of its central role in Alzheimer disease. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the independently folded E2 domain of APLP2 and compared that with its paralogues APP and APLP2, demonstrating high overall structural similarities. The crystal structure of APLP2 E2 was solved as an antiparallel dimer, and analysis of the protein interfaces revealed a distinct mode of dimerization that differs from the previously reported dimerization of either APP or APLP1. Analysis of the APLP2 E2 metal binding sites suggested it binds zinc and copper in a similar manner to APP and APLP1. The structure of this key protein might suggest a relationship between the distinct mode of dimerization and its biologic functions.-Roisman, L. C., Han, S., Chuei, M. J., Connor, A. R., Cappai, R.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is diagnosed based on a clinical evaluation as well as analyses of classical biomarkers: Abeta42, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Although the sensitivities and specificities of the classical biomarkers are fairly good for detection of AD, there is still a need to develop novel biochemical markers for early detection of AD. OBJECTIVE: We explored if integration of novel proteins with classical biomarkers in CSF can better discriminate AD from non-AD subjects. METHODS: We applied ELISA, mass spectrometry, and multivariate modeling to investigate classical biomarkers and the CSF proteome in subjects (n = 206) with 76 AD patients, 74 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, 11 frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients, and 45 non-dementia controls. The MCI patients were followed for 4-9 years and 21 of these converted to AD, whereas 53 remained stable. RESULTS: By combining classical CSF biomarkers with twelve novel markers, the area of the ROC curves (AUROCS) of distinguishing AD and MCI/AD converters from non-AD were 93% and 96%, respectively. The FTDs and non-dementia controls were identified versus all other groups with AUROCS of 96% and 87%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of new and classical CSF biomarkers in a model-based approach can improve the identification of AD, FTD, and non-dementia control subjects.",

In this study, we have unravelled the interactions as well as anti amyloidogenic behaviour of 40 small molecule inhibitors with Abeta1-40 peptide and Iowa mutant D23N-Abeta115-42 peptide at atomic level and their modes of binding by docking approaches. The binding mode between wild type peptide and drug is distinctly different from the Iowa-mutant-peptide and drug. Here we proposed possible mechanisms of amyloid beta peptide inhibition by small molecule and prevent monomer-monomer interactions via at least three different mechanisms. In the first mechanism, four catechins efficiently interacted with the C-terminal region of peptides through hydrogen bonds and inhibited the peptides. This may lead to blockage of access of second molecule of Abeta-peptide. Secondly, in the case Iowa mutant D23N-Abeta15-42 peptide, same catechin form hydrogen bond with the important mutated Asn23 residue which acts as hydrogen bond donor and acceptor leading to tight binding of inhibitor with the peptide and may prevent monomer-monomer interactions. The third mechanism relies on the ability of drug molecules to mask hydrophobic residues of the peptide, thereby possibly inhibiting hydrophobic interactions between the two beta peptides.",

We demonstrate that amyloid plaque seeding is increased in the absence of functional Trem2. Increased seeding is accompanied by decreased microglial clustering around newly seeded plaques and reduced plaque-associated apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Reduced ApoE deposition in plaques is also observed in brains of AD patients carrying TREM2 coding variants. Proteomic analyses and microglia depletion experiments revealed microglia as one origin of plaque-associated ApoE. Longitudinal amyloid small animal positron emission tomography demonstrates accelerated amyloidogenesis in Trem2 loss-of-function mutants at early stages, which progressed at a lower rate with aging. These findings suggest that in the absence of functional Trem2, early amyloidogenesis is accelerated due to reduced phagocytic clearance of amyloid seeds despite reduced plaque-associated ApoE.",

Irisin is an exercise-induced myokine released on cleavage of the membrane-bound precursor protein fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), also expressed in the hippocampus. Here we show that FNDC5/irisin levels are reduced in AD hippocampi and cerebrospinal fluid, and in experimental AD models. Knockdown of brain FNDC5/irisin impairs long-term potentiation and novel object recognition memory in mice. Conversely, boosting brain levels of FNDC5/irisin rescues synaptic plasticity and memory in AD mouse models. Peripheral overexpression of FNDC5/irisin rescues memory impairment, whereas blockade of either peripheral or brain FNDC5/irisin attenuates the neuroprotective actions of physical exercise on synaptic plasticity and memory in AD mice. By showing that FNDC5/irisin is an important mediator of the beneficial effects of exercise in AD models, our findings place FNDC5/irisin as a novel agent capable of opposing synapse failure and memory impairment in AD.",

However, how such neural damage contributes to AD pathology remains unclear; specifically, the relationship between the timing of a TBI relative to aging and the onset of AD pathology is not known. In this study, we have examined the effect of TBI on subsequent beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition in APP/PS1 (APPSWE/PSEN1dE9) transgenic mice either before (3 months of age) or after the onset (6 months of age) of plaque pathology. Lateral fluid percussion injury (LFPI), a model of diffuse brain injury, was induced in APP/PS1 and C57Bl/6 wild-type (WT) littermates. LFPI caused a significant increase in both total (p < 0.001) and fibrillar (p < 0.001) Abeta plaque load in the cortex of 3-month-old APP/PS1 mice compared to sham-treated mice at 30 days post-injury. However, in the cortex of 6-month-old mice at 30 days post-injury, LFPI caused a significant decrease in total (p < 0.01), but not fibrillar (p > 0.05), Abeta plaque load compared to sham-treated mice. No Abeta plaques were present in any WT mice across these conditions. Glial fibrillary acidic protein immunolabeling of astrocytes and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 immunolabeling of microglial/macrophages was not significantly different (p < 0.05) in injured animals compared to sham mice, or APP/PS1 mice compared to WT mice.

Pyk2 genetic variation contributes to late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. We recently observed that Pyk2 is required for synapse loss and for learning deficits in a transgenic mouse model of AD. Here, we explore the cellular and biochemical basis for the action of Pyk2 tyrosine kinase in amyloid-beta oligomer (Abetao)-induced dendritic spine loss. Overexpression of Pyk2 reduces dendritic spine density of hippocampal neurons by a kinase-dependent mechanism. Biochemical isolation of Pyk2-interacting proteins from brain identifies Graf1c, a RhoA GTPase-activating protein inhibited by Pyk2. Abetao-induced reductions in dendritic spine motility and chronic spine loss require both Pyk2 kinase and RhoA activation. Thus, Pyk2 functions at postsynaptic sites to modulate F-actin control by RhoA and regulate synapse maintenance of relevance to AD risk.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Genetic variation at the Pyk2 locus is a risk for Alzheimer's disease. We have observed that Pyk2 is required for AD transgenic synapse loss and memory dysfunction. However, the cellular and biochemical basis for Pyk2 function related to AD is not defined.

    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), deposition of insoluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) is followed by intracellular aggregation of tau in the neocortex and subsequent neuronal cell loss, synaptic loss, brain atrophy, and cognitive impairment. By the time even the earliest clinical symptoms are detectable, Abeta accumulation is close to reaching its peak and neocortical tau pathology is frequently already present. The period in which AD pathology is accumulating in the absence of cognitive symptoms represents a clinically relevant time window for therapeutic intervention. Sleep is increasingly recognized as a potential marker for AD pathology and future risk of cognitive impairment. Previous studies in animal models and humans have associated decreased non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep slow wave activity (SWA) with Abeta deposition. In this study, we analyzed cognitive performance, brain imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers in participants enrolled in longitudinal studies of aging. In addition, we monitored their sleep using a single-channel electroencephalography (EEG) device worn on the forehead. After adjusting for multiple covariates such as age and sex, we found that NREM SWA showed an inverse relationship with AD pathology, particularly tauopathy, and that this association was most evident at the lowest frequencies of NREM SWA. Given that our study participants were predominantly cognitively normal, this suggested that changes in NREM SWA, especially at 1 to 2 Hz, might be able to discriminate tau pathology and cognitive impairment either before or at the earliest stages of symptomatic AD.",

We describe a hitherto unrecognized multiprotease complex containing active beta- and gamma-secretases. BACE1 coimmunoprecipitated and cofractionated with gamma-secretase in cultured cells and in mouse and human brain. An endogenous high molecular weight (HMW) complex (~5 MD) containing beta- and gamma-secretases and holo-APP was catalytically active in vitro and generated a full array of Abeta peptides, with physiological Abeta42/40 ratios. The isolated complex responded properly to gamma-secretase modulators. Alzheimer's-causing mutations in presenilin altered the Abeta42/40 peptide ratio generated by the HMW beta/gamma-secretase complex indistinguishably from that observed in whole cells.

    "abstract": "High-fidelity mapping of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques is critical for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease. However, in vivo probing of Abeta plaques by commercially available thioflavin derivatives (ThT or ThS) has proven to be extremely limited, as evident by the restriction of enrichment quenching effect, low signal-to-noise ( S/ N) ratio, and poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrability. Herein, we demonstrate a rational design strategy of near-infrared (NIR) aggregation-induced emission (AIE)-active probes for Abeta plaques, through introducing a lipophilic pi-conjugated thiophene-bridge for extension to NIR wavelength range with enhancement of BBB penetrability, and tuning the substituted position of the sulfonate group for guaranteeing specific hydrophilicity to maintain the fluorescence- off state before binding to Abeta deposition. Probe QM-FN-SO3 has settled well the AIE dilemma between the lipophilic requirement for longer emission and aggregation behavior from water to protein fibrillogenesis, thus making a breakthrough in high-fidelity feedback on in vivo detection of Abeta plaques with remarkable binding affinity, and serving as an efficient alternative to the commercial probe ThT or ThS.",

To this end, we performed large-scale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water on the dimer of the seven-residue fragment of the Alzheimer's amyloid-beta peptide, Abeta16-22, for a total time of 0.34 ms. We compared the effects of these MMFFs by analyzing various global reaction coordinates, secondary structure contents, the fibril population, the in-register and out-of-register architectures, and the fibril formation time at 310 K. While the AMBER94, AMBER99, and AMBER12SB force fields do not predict any beta-sheets, the seven force fields, AMBER96, GROMOS45a3, GROMOS53a5, GROMOS53a6, GROMOS43a1, GROMOS43a2, and GROMOS54a7, form beta-sheets rapidly. In contrast, the following five force fields, AMBER99-ILDN, AMBER14SB, CHARMM22*, CHARMM36, and CHARMM36m, are the best candidates for studying amyloid peptide assembly, as they provide good balances in terms of structures and kinetics.

The aim of this study was to quantitatively investigate the retinal vessels in these disorders, using dynamic vessel analyzer (DVA) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) analysis. Twelve subjects with AD, 12 subjects with MCI, and 32 gender- and age-matched controls were prospectively enrolled. Mean +- SD age was 72.9 +- 7.2 years in the AD group, 76.3 +- 6.9 years in the MCI group, and 71.6 +- 5.9 years in the control group (p = 0.104). In the DVA dynamic analysis, the arterial dilation was decreased in the AD group (0.77 +- 2.06%), in the comparison with the control group (3.53 +- 1.25%, p = 0.002). The reaction amplitude was decreased both in AD (0.21 +- 1.80%, <0.0001) and MCI (2.29 +- 1.81%, p = 0.048) subjects, compared with controls (3.86 +- 1.94%). OCTA variables did not differ among groups. In the Pearson correlation analysis, amyloid beta level in the cerebrospinal fluid was directly correlated with the arterial dilation (R = 0.441, p = 0.040) and reaction amplitude (R = 0.580, p = 0.005). This study demonstrate that Alzheimer's and MCI subjects are characterized by a significant impairment of the retinal neurovascular coupling.

Especially, ENPs could either up- or downregulate peptide fibrillation, which is associated with various degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. This work reports the effects of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with different shapes on the aggregation of an amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta(1-40)) involved in Alzheimer's disease. Two kinds of AuNPs were investigated, i.e., gold nanospheres (AuNSs, ~20 nm in diameter) and gold nanocubes (AuNCs, ~20 nm in edge length). It was found that AuNPs play a catalytic role in peptide nucleation through interfacial adsorption of Abeta(1-40). AuNSs with hybrid facets have higher affinity to Abeta(1-40) because of the higher degree of surface atomic unsaturation than the {100}-faceted AuNCs. Therefore, AuNSs exert a more significant acceleration effect on the fibrillation process of Abeta(1-40) than AuNCs. Besides, a shape-dependent secondary structure transformation of Abeta(1-40) with different AuNPs was observed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The variation of peptide-NP and peptide-peptide interactions caused by the shape alteration of AuNPs influences the equilibrium of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which is believed to be responsible for the shape-dependent secondary structure transformation. The study offers further understanding on the complicated NP-mediated Abeta aggregation and also facilitates further development on designing and synthesizing task-specific AuNPs for amyloid disease diagnosis and therapy.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the aggregation of Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide into oligomers, fibrils and plaques. Many factors influencing this process as well as the stability of the various Abeta aggregates are known to date, and include the concentration and type of metal ions. Most experimental and theoretical studies have concentrated on heavy metal ions, like Fe2+, Zn2+, or Cu2+, while the smaller alkali ions Li+, Na+, and K+ have not gained much attention notwithstanding their role and ubiquity in physiological environments. In this work, we applied atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the potential role of these alkali ions in stabilizing fibrillar Abeta oligomers of different size and topology, i.e., single and double filament systems comprising 3-24 peptide chains per filament. We find a pronounced difference on the molecular level in the interaction behavior with free carboxylate groups of the Abeta oligomer: Li+ forms stable bridged interactions, whereas K+ interacts more transiently and lacks bridging. The behavior of Na+ is in between, so that this ion-protein interaction obeys the renowned Hofmeister series. These differences are also reflected in the ability of the alkali ions to stabilize the oligomer secondary structure. The stabilizing effect is most pronounced for the smaller fibrillar oligomers, suggesting that the type of alkali ion critically affects the initial stages of fibril formation. Our findings thus offer a molecular explanation for the observation that the polymorphisms of Abeta fibril structures are caused by differences in the surrounding ionic environment.

    "abstract": "The intramembrane aspartyl protease gamma-secretase (GSEC) cleaves single-span transmembrane helices including the C-terminal fragment of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This substrate is initially cleaved at the epsilon-site followed by successive processing (trimming) events mostly in steps of three amino acids. GSEC is responsible for the formation of N-terminal APP amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides of different length (e.g., Abeta42) that can form aggregates involved in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. The molecular mechanism of GSEC-APP substrate recognition is key for understanding how different peptide products are formed and could help in designing APP-selective modulators. Based on the known structure of apo GSEC and the APP-C99 fragment we have generated putative structural models of the initial binding in three different possible modes using extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The binding mode with the substrate helix located in a cleft between the transmembrane helices 2 and 3 of the presenilin subunit was identified as a most likely binding mode. Based on this arrangement, the processing steps were investigated using restraint MD simulations to pull the scissile bond (for each processing step) into a transition like (cleavable) state. This allowed us to analyze in detail the motions and energetic contributions of participating residues. The structural model agrees qualitatively well with the influence of many mutations in GSEC and C99. It also explains the effects of inhibitors, cross-linking, as well as spectroscopic data on GSEC substrate binding and can serve as working model for the future planning of structural and biochemical studies.",

    "title": "How Fluorescent Tags Modify Oligomer Size Distributions of the Alzheimer Peptide.",
    "abstract": "Within the complex aggregation process of amyloidogenic peptides into fibrils, early stages of aggregation play a central role and reveal fundamental properties of the underlying mechanism of aggregation. In particular, low-molecular-weight aggregates of the Alzheimer amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) have attracted increasing interest because of their role in cytotoxicity and neuronal apoptosis, typical of aggregation-related diseases. One of the main techniques used to characterize oligomeric stages is fluorescence spectroscopy. To this end, Abeta peptide chains are functionalized with fluorescent tags, often covalently bound to the disordered N-terminus region of the peptide, with the assumption that functionalization and presence of the fluorophore will not modify the process of self-assembly nor the final fibrillar structure. In this investigation, we systematically study the effects of four of the most commonly used fluorophores on the aggregation of Abeta (1-40). Time-resolved and single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy have been chosen to monitor the oligomer populations at different fibrillation times, and transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and x-ray diffraction to investigate the structure of mature fibrils. Although the structures of the fibrils were only slightly affected by the fluorescent tags, the sizes of the detected oligomeric species varied significantly depending on the chosen fluorophore. In particular, we relate the presence of high-molecular-weight oligomers of Abeta (1-40) (as found for the fluorophores HiLyte 647 and Atto 655) to net-attractive, hydrophobic fluorophore-peptide interactions, which are weak in the case of HiLyte 488 and Atto 488. The latter leads for Abeta (1-40) to low-molecular-weight oligomers only, which is in contrast to Abeta (1-42). The disease-relevant peptide Abeta (1-42) displays high-molecular-weight oligomers even in the absence of significant attractive fluorophore-peptide interactions. Hence, our findings reveal the potentially high impact of the properties of fluorophores on transient aggregates, which needs to be included in the interpretation of experimental data of oligomers of fluorescently labeled peptides.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) can aggregate and form plaques, which are considered as one of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. This study aims to directly compare the neuroprotective activities in vitro of two marine-derived carotenoids astaxanthin and fucoxanthin that have shown a spectrum of biological activities, including neuroprotection. The in vitro neuroprotective activities were investigated against Abeta1-42-mediated toxicity in pheochromocytoma (PC-12) neuronal cells using the MTT cell viability assay, anti-apoptotic, antioxidant and neurite outgrowth activities; as well as inhibition against Abeta1-42 fibrillization in the Thioflavin T (ThT) assay of fibril kinetics and via transmission electron microscopic (TEM) evaluation of fibril morphology. The results demonstrated that both astaxanthin and fucoxanthin exhibited multi-neuroprotective effects favouring fucoxanthin over astaxanthin supporting neuroprotective roles of marine-derived carotenoids as potential novel dementia prevention or therapeutic strategies.",

In response to this article, here we first discussed evidence that vascular dysfunction is an important early event in AD pathophysiology. Next, we examined various imaging sequences that could be easily implemented to evaluate different types of vascular dysfunction associated with, and/or contributing to, AD pathophysiology, including changes in blood-brain barrier integrity and cerebral blood flow. Vascular imaging biomarkers of small vessel disease of the brain, which is responsible for >50% of dementia worldwide, including AD, are already established, well characterized, and easy to recognize.

To investigate the relationship between Abeta42 aggregation and its cytotoxicity and the influence of a potential drug on both phenomena, we have studied the effects of trodusquemine. This aminosterol enhances the rate of aggregation by promoting monomer-dependent secondary nucleation, but significantly reduces the toxicity of the resulting oligomers to neuroblastoma cells by inhibiting their binding to the cellular membranes. When administered to a C. elegans model of AD, we again observe an increase in aggregate formation alongside the suppression of Abeta42-induced toxicity. In addition to oligomer displacement, the reduced toxicity could also point towards an increased rate of conversion of oligomers to less toxic fibrils. The ability of a small molecule to reduce the toxicity of oligomeric species represents a potential therapeutic strategy against AD.",

All coated particles examined inhibited amyloid formation, with cobalt(ii) MPN-coated particles exhibiting the highest inhibition activity (90%). Molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations suggested that the geometry of the exposed cobalt coordination site in the cobalt-tannic acid networks facilitates its interactions with histidine and methionine residues in the amyloid beta peptides.

    "abstract": "We have proposed a dual-quenching electrochemiluminescence (ECL) strategy which is based on tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(II) [Ru(bpy)32+] as chromophores caged in three-dimensional (3D) zinc oxalate metal-organic frameworks [Ru(bpy)32+/zinc oxalate MOFs] for ultrasensitive detection of amyloid-beta (Abeta). The three-dimensional chromophore connectivity in zinc oxalate MOFs provided a network for rapid excited-state energy transfer migration among Ru(bpy)32+ units which shielded the chromophores from solvent molecules and led to a high-energy Ru emission efficiency. In addition, we found that both Au nanoparticles and NiFe-based nanocube MOFs could contribute to the reduction of the ECL intensity of the chromophore. The ECL emission spectra of 3D Ru(bpy)32+/zinc oxalate MOFs overlapped appropriately with the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of Au@NiFe MOFs composites, which could trigger the resonance energy transfer (RET) behavior between Ru(bpy)32+/zinc oxalate MOFs (donor) and Au@NiFe MOFs (acceptor), achieving the dual-quenching effect of Ru(bpy)32+ encapsulated in 3D zinc oxalate MOFs and significantly boosting the sensitivity of the Abeta detection immunosensor. In order to examine the clinical practicability, we have applied it to verify the content of Abeta solution ranging from 100 fg mL-1 to 50 ng mL-1 and obtained the calibration curve with high correlation coefficient, along with the low limit of detection of 13.8 fg mL-1. Above all, this work demonstrated an approach of constructing dual-quenching effect ECL immunosensors in whole 3D MOF systems and its application in ECL detection methodology.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of physical activity, Alzheimer disease (AD), and other brain pathologies and cognition in older adults. METHODS: We studied 454 brain autopsies from decedents in a clinical-pathologic cohort study. Nineteen cognitive tests were summarized in a global cognitive score. Total daily physical activity summarized continuous multiday recordings of activity during everyday living in the community setting. A global motor ability score summarized 10 supervised motor performance tests. A series of regression analyses were used to examine associations of physical activity, AD, and other brain pathologies with global cognition proximate to death controlling for age, sex, education, and motor abilities. RESULTS: Higher levels of total daily activity (estimate 0.148, 95% confidence interval 0.053-0.244, SE 0.049, p = 0.003) and better motor abilities (estimate 0.283, 95% confidence interval, 0.175-0.390, SE 0.055, p < 0.001) were independently associated with better cognition. These independent associations remained significant when terms for AD and other pathologies were added as well as in sensitivity analyses excluding cases with poor cognition or dementia. Adding interaction terms, the associations of total daily activity and motor abilities with cognition did not vary in individuals with and without dementia. The associations of AD and other pathologies with cognition did not vary with the levels of total daily activity or motor abilities. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity in older adults may provide cognitive reserve to maintain function independent of the accumulation of diverse brain pathologies. Further studies are needed to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this potential reserve and to ensure the causal effects of physical activity.",

    "abstract": "gamma-secretase, an intramembrane-cleaving aspartyl protease is involved in the cleavage of a large number of intramembrane proteins. The most prominent substrate is the amyloid precursor protein, whose proteolytic processing leads to the production of different amyloid Abeta peptides. These peptides are known to form toxic aggregates and may play a key role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, the three-dimensional structure of gamma-secretase has been determined via Cryo-EM, elucidating the spatial geometry of this enzyme complex in different functional states. We have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the global dynamics and conformational transitions of gamma-secretase, as well as the water and lipid distributions in and around the transmembrane domains in atomic detail. Simulations were performed on the full enzyme complex and on the membrane embedded parts alone. The simulations revealed global motions compatible with the experimental enzyme structures and indicated little dependence of the dynamics of the transmembrane domains on the soluble extracellular subunits. During the simulation on the membrane spanning part a transition between an inactive conformation (with catalytic residues far apart) toward a putatively active form (with catalytic residues in close proximity) has been observed. This conformational change is associated with a distinct rearrangement of transmembrane helices, a global compaction of the catalytically active presenilin subunit a change in the water structure near the active site and a rigidification of the protein fold. The observed conformational rearrangement allows the interpretation of the effect of several mutations on the activity of gamma-secretase. A number of long-lived lipid binding sites could be identified on the membrane spanning surface of gamma-secretase which may coincide with association regions of hydrophobic membrane helices to form putative substrate binding exosites.",

    "abstract": "We engineered and employed a chaperone-like amyloid-binding protein Nucleobindin 1 (NUCB1) to stabilize human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) protofibrils for use as immunogen in mice. We obtained multiple monoclonal antibody (mAb) clones that were reactive against hIAPP protofibrils. A secondary screen was carried out to identify clones that cross-reacted with amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta42) protofibrils, but not with Abeta40 monomers. These mAbs were further characterized in several in vitro assays, in immunohistological studies of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in AD patient brain tissue. We show that mAbs obtained by immunizing mice with the NUCB1-hIAPP complex cross-react with Abeta42, specifically targeting protofibrils and inhibiting their further aggregation. In line with conformation-specific binding, the mAbs appear to react with an intracellular antigen in diseased tissue, but not with amyloid plaques. We hypothesize that the mAbs we describe here recognize a secondary or quaternary structural epitope that is common to multiple amyloid protofibrils. In summary, we report a method to create mAbs that are conformation-sensitive and sequence-independent and can target more than one type of protofibril species.",

    "title": "Investigation of frailty as a moderator of the relationship between neuropathology and dementia in Alzheimer's disease: a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Rush Memory and Aging Project.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Some people with substantial Alzheimer's disease pathology at autopsy had shown few characteristic clinical symptoms or signs of the disease, whereas others with little Alzheimer's disease pathology have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia. We aimed to examine whether frailty, which is associated with both age and dementia, moderates the relationship between Alzheimer's disease pathology and Alzheimer's dementia. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional analysis of data from participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a clinical-pathological cohort study of older adults (older than 59 years) without known dementia at baseline, living in Illinois, USA. Participants in the cohort study underwent annual neuropsychological and clinical evaluations. In the present cross-sectional analysis, we included those participants who did not have any form of dementia or who had Alzheimer's dementia at the time of their last clinical assessment and who had died and for whom complete autopsy data were available. Alzheimer's disease pathology was quantified by a summary measure of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic and diffuse plaques. Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia was based on clinician consensus. Frailty was operationalised retrospectively using health variable information obtained at each clincial evaluation using the deficit accumulation approach (41-item frailty index). Logistic regression and moderation modelling were used to assess relationships between Alzheimer's disease pathology, frailty, and Alzheimer's dementia. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and education. FINDINGS: Up to data cutoff (Jan 20, 2017), we included 456 participants (mean age at death 89 7 years [SD 6 1]; 316 [69%] women). 242 (53%) had a diagnosis of possible or probable Alzheimer's dementia at their last clinical assessment. Frailty (odds ratio 1 76, 95% CI 1 54-2 02; p<0 0001) and Alzheimer's disease pathology (4 81, 3 31-7 01; p<0 0001) were independently associated with Alzheimer's dementia, after adjusting for age, sex, and education. When frailty was added to the model for the relationship between Alzheimer's disease pathology and Alzheimer's dementia, model fit improved (p<0 0001). There was a significant interaction between frailty and Alzheimer's disease pathology (odds ratio 0 73, 95% CI 0 57-0 94; pinteraction=0 015). People with an increased frailty score had a weakened direct link between Alzheimer's disease pathology and Alzheimer's dementia; that is, people with a low amount of frailty were better able to tolerate Alzheimer's disease pathology, whereas those with higher amounts of frailty were more likely both to have more Alzheimer's disease pathology and for it to be expressed as dementia. INTERPRETATION: The degree of frailty among people of the same age modifies the association between Alzheimer's disease pathology and Alzheimer's dementia. That frailty is related to both odds of Alzheimer's dementia and disease expression has implications for clinical management, since individuals with even a low level of Alzheimer's disease pathology might be at risk for dementia if they have high amounts of frailty. Further research should assess how frailty and cognition change over time to better elucidate this complex relationship. FUNDING: None.",

    "title": "Quantitative interaction proteomics reveals differences in the interactomes of amyloid precursor protein isoforms.",
    "abstract": "The generation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential proteolysis by beta- and gamma-secretases is a key pathological event in the initiation and propagation of Alzheimer's disease. Abeta and the transcriptionally active APP intracellular domain are generated preferentially from the APP695 isoform compared to the longer APP751 isoform. As the Abeta and amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain produced from cleavage of APP695 and APP751 are identical we hypothesised that the two isoforms have differences within their interactomes which mediate the differential processing of the two isoforms. To investigate this, we applied a proteomics-based approach to identify differences in the interactomes of the APP695 and APP751 isoforms. Using stable isotope labelling of amino acids in cell culture and quantitative proteomics, we compared the interactomes of APP695 and APP751 expressed in human SH-SY5Y cells. Through this approach, we identified enrichment of proteins involved in mitochondrial function, the nuclear pore and nuclear transport specifically in the APP695 interactome. Further interrogation of the APP interactome and subsequent experimental validation (co-immunoprecipitation and siRNA knockdown) revealed GAP43 as a specific modulator of APP751 proteolysis, altering Abeta generation. Our data indicate that interrogation of the APP interactome can be exploited to identify proteins which influence APP proteolysis and Abeta production in an isoform dependent-manner.

    "abstract": "Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a promising fluid biomarker of disease progression for various cerebral proteopathies. Here we leverage the unique characteristics of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network and ultrasensitive immunoassay technology to demonstrate that NfL levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (n = 187) and serum (n = 405) are correlated with one another and are elevated at the presymptomatic stages of familial Alzheimer's disease. Longitudinal, within-person analysis of serum NfL dynamics (n = 196) confirmed this elevation and further revealed that the rate of change of serum NfL could discriminate mutation carriers from non-mutation carriers almost a decade earlier than cross-sectional absolute NfL levels (that is, 16.2 versus 6.8 years before the estimated symptom onset). Serum NfL rate of change peaked in participants converting from the presymptomatic to the symptomatic stage and was associated with cortical thinning assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, but less so with amyloid-beta deposition or glucose metabolism (assessed by positron emission tomography). Serum NfL was predictive for both the rate of cortical thinning and cognitive changes assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination and Logical Memory test. Thus, NfL dynamics in serum predict disease progression and brain neurodegeneration at the early presymptomatic stages of familial Alzheimer's disease, which supports its potential utility as a clinically useful biomarker.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42), a constituively-generated peptide, in the brain is considered an upstream event in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Abeta1-42-induced pathophysiology has been extensively studied in experimental mice and rats. However, neurotoxicity of murine Abeta1-42 is much less understood than human Abeta1-42. Here we report difference in ability for extracellular Zn2+ influx into dentate granule cells of rats between human and rat Abeta1-42 and its significance. Human Abeta1-42 rapidly increased intracellular Zn2+, which was determined with intracellular ZnAF-2, in dentate granule cells, 5 min after injection of Abeta1-42 (25 muM, 1 mul) into the dentate gyrus, while rat Abeta1-42 did not increase intracellular Zn2+. In vivo perforant pathway LTP was attenuated under pre-perfusion with 5 nM human Abeta1-42 in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 10 nM Zn2+, recapitulating the concentration of extracellular Zn2+, but not with 5 nM rat Abeta1-42 in ACSF containing 10 nM Zn2+. The present study suggests that rat Abeta1-42 has lower affinity for extracellular Zn2+ than human Abeta1-42 and does not capture Zn2+ in the extracellular compartment, resulting in no significant effect on cognitive activity of rat even in the range of very low nanomolar concentrations of endogenous Abeta1-42.",

We investigated the utility of Abeta clearance proteins as biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Serum apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, compliment protein C3 (C3), transthyretin, and cholesterol levels were measured in 273 subjects, and we analyzed the relationship between these levels and brain atrophy and cerebral blood flow in 63 clinically diagnosed mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, and nondemented disease control subjects. Results: ApoA-I and transthyretin levels and the active form of C3:native form of C3 ratio achieved an area under the curve of 0.89 (sensitivity: 83%, specificity: 90%) for detecting late mild cognitive impairment. Atrophy was associated with decreased apoA-I and high-density lipoprotein levels. Subjects with reduced cerebral blood flow had lower levels of active form of C3, apoA-I, high-density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol. Low native form of C3 and high active form of C3 levels were found in the hippocampi of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Discussion: Abeta clearance proteins in the serum are potential biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment evaluation.",

    "title": "Are comorbidities compatible with a molecular pathological classification of neurodegenerative diseases?",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to provide an update on comorbidities in neurodegenerative conditions. The term comorbidity is used here to distinguish cases with overlapping pathogenic mechanisms, which includes combinations of neurodegenerative proteinopathies from cases with multimorbidity, which is defined as concomitant brain and systemic disorders with different pathogenic mechanisms. RECENT FINDINGS: Comorbid proteinopathies are more frequent in both sporadic and hereditary neurodegenerative diseases than previously assumed. The most frequent additional proteinopathies are related to Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body disorder, and limbic predominant transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 proteinopathy, however, different forms of tau pathologies are also increasingly recognized. In addition to ageing, synergistic interaction of proteins, common disease pathways, and the influence of genetic variations are discussed as possible pathogenic players. SUMMARY: Comorbid proteinopathies might influence the clinical course and have implications for biomarker and therapeutic development. As pure forms of proteinopathies are still observed, the notion of current molecular classification is justified. This corroborates elucidation of various pathogenic pathways leading to neurodegeneration. Assuming that single proteins and associated pathways are targeted in therapy trials, efforts are needed to better stratify patients and to select pure proteinopathy forms lacking unfavorable genetic constellations. Otherwise combined therapeutic strategies might be necessary for comorbid proteinopathies.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess whether neurodegenerative pathologies are differentially related to trajectories of change in different cognitive abilities. METHODS: At annual intervals for up to 21 years, 915 older participants in a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study completed a battery of 15 tests from which previously established composite measures of episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, and perceptual speed were derived. At death, they underwent a neuropathologic examination to quantify Alzheimer disease pathology, Lewy bodies, transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, and hippocampal sclerosis plus multiple markers of cerebrovascular disease. Time-varying effect models were used to assess change over time in the relation of neuropathologic markers to cognitive trajectories. RESULTS: Controlling for pathology, decline in perceptual speed was evident about 15 years before death; modest decline in semantic and working memory occurred later; and there was little change in episodic memory. Each neurodegenerative marker was associated with lower episodic memory function beginning about 10 to 16 years before death. As time before death decreased, Alzheimer disease pathology, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis were associated with impairment in other cognitive domains but the association of TDP-43 pathology with cognition continued to be mainly confined to episodic memory. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that episodic memory impairment is an early sign of multiple neurodegenerative conditions, which primarily differ in their associations with other cognitive systems.",

    "title": "Association of peripheral blood pressure with gray matter volume in 19- to 40-year-old adults.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To test whether elevated blood pressure (BP) relates to gray matter (GM) volume (GMV) changes in young adults who had not previously been diagnosed with hypertension (systolic BP [SBP]/diastolic BP [DBP] >=140/90 mm Hg). METHODS: We associated BP with GMV from structural 3T T1-weighted MRI of 423 healthy adults between 19 and 40 years of age (mean age 27.7 +- 5.3 years, 177 women, SBP/DBP 123.2/73.4 +- 12.2/8.5 mm Hg). Data originated from 4 previously unpublished cross-sectional studies conducted in Leipzig, Germany. We performed voxel-based morphometry on each study separately and combined results in image-based meta-analyses (IBMA) to assess cumulative effects across studies. Resting BP was assigned to 1 of 4 categories: (1) SBP <120 and DBP <80 mm Hg, (2) SBP 120-129 or DBP 80-84 mm Hg, (3) SBP 130-139 or DBP 85-89 mm Hg, (4) SBP >=140 or DBP >=90 mm Hg. RESULTS: IBMA yielded the following results: (1) lower regional GMV was correlated with higher peripheral BP; (2) lower GMV was found with higher BP when comparing individuals in subhypertensive categories 3 and 2, respectively, to those in category 1; (3) lower BP-related GMV was found in regions including hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, frontal, and parietal structures (e.g., precuneus). CONCLUSION: BP >=120/80 mm Hg was associated with lower GMV in regions that have previously been related to GM decline in older individuals with manifest hypertension. Our study shows that BP-associated GM alterations emerge continuously across the range of BP and earlier in adulthood than previously assumed. This suggests that treating hypertension or maintaining lower BP in early adulthood might be essential for preventing the pathophysiologic cascade of asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease to symptomatic end-organ damage, such as stroke or dementia.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of monomeric amyloid beta protein (Abeta) peptide into oligomers and amyloid fibrils in the mammalian brain is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Insight into the thermodynamic stability of the Abeta peptide in different polymeric states is fundamental to defining and predicting the aggregation process. Experimental determination of Abeta thermodynamic behavior is challenging due to the transient nature of Abeta oligomers and the low peptide solubility. Furthermore, quantitative calculation of a thermodynamic phase diagram for a specific peptide requires extremely long computational times. Here, using a coarse-grained protein model, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to determine an equilibrium concentration and temperature phase diagram for the amyloidogenic peptide fragment Abeta16-22 Our results reveal that the only thermodynamically stable phases are the solution phase and the macroscopic fibrillar phase, and that there also exists a hierarchy of metastable phases. The boundary line between the solution phase and fibril phase is found by calculating the temperature-dependent solubility of a macroscopic Abeta16-22 fibril consisting of an infinite number of beta-sheet layers. This in silico determination of an equilibrium (solubility) phase diagram for a real amyloid-forming peptide, Abeta16-22, over the temperature range of 277-330 K agrees well with fibrillation experiments and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements of the fibril morphologies formed. This in silico approach of predicting peptide solubility is also potentially useful for optimizing biopharmaceutical production and manufacturing nanofiber scaffolds for tissue engineering.",

    "title": "TFEB-mediated Enhancement of the Autophagy-lysosomal Pathway Dually Modulates the Process of Amyloid beta-Protein Generation in Neurons.",
    "abstract": "Abnormalities of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP) have been implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Activation of TFEB (transcription factor EB), a master regulator of the ALP, leads to ALP facilitation. The present study sought to clarify whether TFEB-mediated ALP facilitation influences the process of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) generation in neurons. TFEB was overexpressed in mature rat primary cortical neurons via recombinant adenoviruses, without (basal conditions) or with co-overexpression of wild-type amyloid precursor protein (APP) or its beta-C-terminal fragment (beta-CTF). We confirmed that TFEB overexpression upregulated the lysosomal proteins, cathepsin D and LAMP-1. In TFEB-expressing neurons, protein levels of ADAM10 were profoundly increased, whereas those of APP, BACE1, or gamma-secretase complex proteins were unaffected. However, TFEB did not affect ADAM10 mRNA levels. TFEB overexpression had different effects on Abeta production depending on the expression level of APP or beta-CTF: TFEB slightly decreased Abeta secretion under basal conditions; clearly increased alpha-CTF levels and marginally increased beta-CTF levels with modest increases in secreted Abeta in APP-expressing neurons; and caused a remarkable increase in beta-CTF levels with a significant increase in secreted Abeta in beta-CTF-expressing neurons. Inhibition of proteasomes, but not lysosomes, markedly increased beta-CTF levels in beta-CTF-expressing neurons. These results collectively indicate that TFEB modulates Abeta production not only by increasing alpha-secretase processing of APP through ADAM10 upregulation but also by augmenting beta-CTF levels possibly via altered proteasome-mediated catabolism. Thus, TFEB-mediated ALP enhancement appears to have dual, but opposite, effects on Abeta production in neurons.",

Next, the biological assessment of each of them was performed. Based on the obtained results we identified 6-chloro-N-[2-(2,3-dihydro-1H-cyclopenta[b]quinolin-9-ylamino)-hexyl]]-nicotinamide hydrochloride (3e) as the most promising compound with inhibitory potencies against EeAChE and EqBuChE in the low nanomolar level 67 and 153 nM, respectively. Moreover, 3e compound is non-hepatotoxic, able to inhibit amyloid beta aggregation, and shows a mix-type of cholinesterase's inhibition. The mixed type of inhibition of the compound was confirmed by molecular modeling. Then, yeast three-hybrid (Y3H) technology was used to confirm the known ligand-receptor interactions. New derivatives do not show antioxidant activity (confirmed by the use of two different tests). A pKa assay method was developed to identify the basic physicochemical properties of 3e compound. A LogP assay confirmed that 3e compound fulfills Lipinsky's rule of five.",

However, little is known about the regulation and consequences of microglial activation in the aging human brain. Here we report that the proportion of morphologically activated microglia (PAM) in postmortem cortical tissue is strongly associated with beta-amyloid, tau-related neuropathology, and the rate of cognitive decline. Effect sizes for PAM measures are substantial, comparable to that of APOE epsilon4, the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, and mediation models support an upstream role for microglial activation in Alzheimer's disease via accumulation of tau. Further, we identify a common variant (rs2997325) influencing PAM that also affects in vivo microglial activation measured by [11C]-PBR28 PET in an independent cohort. Thus, our analyses begin to uncover pathways regulating resident neuroinflammation and identify overlaps of PAM's genetic architecture with those of Alzheimer's disease and several other traits.",

    "title": "Computing the Pathogenicity of Alzheimer's Disease Presenilin 1 Mutations.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the major global health challenges of the 21st century. More than 200 distinct mutations in presenilin 1 (PSEN1) cause severe early-onset familial AD (FAD) and are thus of central interest to the etiology of AD. PSEN1 is the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase that produces beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta), and the mutations tend to increase the produced Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio. The molecular reasons for the pathogenesis of these mutations are unknown. We studied a close-to-complete data set of PSEN1 mutations using 21 different computational methods hypothesized to reproduce pathogenesis, using both sequence- and structure-based methods with the full gamma-secretase complex as input. First, we tested whether pathogenicity can be estimated accurately using all possible mutations in PSEN1 as a direct control. Several methods predict the pathogenicity of the mutations (pathogenic vs all other possible mutations) well, with accuracies approaching 90%. We then designed a stricter test for predicting the severity of the mutations estimated by the average clinical age of symptom onset for mutation carriers. Surprisingly, we can predict the clinical age of symptom onset at 95% confidence or higher with several methods. Accordingly, our results show that simple biochemical properties of the amino acid changes rationalize an important part of the pathogenicity of FAD-causing PSEN1 mutations. Although pathogenic mutations generally destabilize gamma-secretase, all of the tested protein stability methods failed to predict pathogenicity. Thus, either the static cryogenic-electron-microscopy-derived molecular-dynamics-equilibrated structures used as input fail to capture the stability effect of mutated side chains or protein stability is simply not a key factor in the pathogenicity. Our findings suggest that the chemical causes of FAD may be modeled and lend promise to the development of a semiquantitative model predicting the age of onset of mutation carriers that could eventually become of care-strategic value.",

They are thought to play critical roles in normal central nervous system (CNS) function and neurological disorders. A recently revealed key characteristic of EVs is that they may travel between the CNS and peripheral circulation. This property has led to intense interest in how EVs might serve as a vehicle for toxic protein clearance and as a readily accessible source of biomarkers for CNS disorders. Furthermore, by bypassing the blood-brain barrier, modified EVs could serve as a unique drug delivery system that targets specific neuronal populations. Further work is necessary to develop and optimize techniques that enable high-yield capture of relevant EV populations, analyze individual EVs and their cargos, and validate preliminary results of EV-derived biomarkers in independent cohorts.",

Here, we perform a phenotypic screen for pTau accumulation in AD-patient iPSC-derived neurons and identify cholesteryl esters (CE), the storage product of excess cholesterol, as upstream regulators of Tau early during AD development. Using isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines carrying mutations in the cholesterol-binding domain of APP or APP null alleles, we found that while CE also regulate Abeta secretion, the effects of CE on Tau and Abeta are mediated by independent pathways. Efficacy and toxicity screening in iPSC-derived astrocytes and neurons showed that allosteric activation of CYP46A1 lowers CE specifically in neurons and is well tolerated by astrocytes. These data reveal that CE independently regulate Tau and Abeta and identify a druggable CYP46A1-CE-Tau axis in AD.",

MnCO3 nanospheres prepared by a homogeneous precipitation method exhibited high ECL efficiency, low toxicity, favorable biocompatibility, and excellent stability. After the functionalization of polydimethyldiallylammonium chloride (PDDA), the obtained MnCO3/PDDA could combine with gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) via electrostatic interaction (MnCO3/PDDA/Au). Besides, HC-7 as a small peptide ligand has demonstrated an ability to bind the Fc portion of an antibody with high affinity. Because the end of HC-7 is a cysteine, it can connect to MnCO3/PDDA/Au via a Au-S bond. Then, the antibody could be effectively captured by HC-7 through specific interaction with a better maintained activity than traditional coupling reaction. To verify the practicability of the constructed immunosensor, beta-amyloid1-42 oligomers (Abeta) were employed as an analyte. On the basis of the above points, the immunosensor performed favorable ECL property to Abeta concentrations in a wide linear range (0.1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL) with a low detection limit (19.95 fg/mL). With excellent repeatability, selectivity, and stability, this method opened up a new avenue for realizing the ultrasensitive detection of Abeta and other biomarkers in a real sample analysis.",

Objective: To evaluate the effect of intensive blood pressure control on risk of dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized clinical trial conducted at 102 sites in the United States and Puerto Rico among adults aged 50 years or older with hypertension but without diabetes or history of stroke. Randomization began on November 8, 2010. The trial was stopped early for benefit on its primary outcome (a composite of cardiovascular events) and all-cause mortality on August 20, 2015. The final date for follow-up of cognitive outcomes was July 22, 2018. Interventions: Participants were randomized to a systolic blood pressure goal of either less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment group; n = 4678) or less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment group; n = 4683). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary cognitive outcome was occurrence of adjudicated probable dementia. Secondary cognitive outcomes included adjudicated mild cognitive impairment and a composite outcome of mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia. Results: Among 9361 randomized participants (mean age, 67.9 years; 3332 women [35.6%]), 8563 (91.5%) completed at least 1 follow-up cognitive assessment. The median intervention period was 3.34 years. During a total median follow-up of 5.11 years, adjudicated probable dementia occurred in 149 participants in the intensive treatment group vs 176 in the standard treatment group (7.2 vs 8.6 cases per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67-1.04). Intensive BP control significantly reduced the risk of mild cognitive impairment (14.6 vs 18.3 cases per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.95) and the combined rate of mild cognitive impairment or probable dementia (20.2 vs 24.1 cases per 1000 person-years; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.97). Conclusions and Relevance: Among ambulatory adults with hypertension, treating to a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 120 mm Hg compared with a goal of less than 140 mm Hg did not result in a significant reduction in the risk of probable dementia. Because of early study termination and fewer than expected cases of dementia, the study may have been underpowered for this end point.

    "abstract": "The degeneration in the locus coeruleus associated with Alzheimer's disease suggests an involvement of the noradrenergic system in the disease pathogenesis. The role of depleted norepinephrine was tested in adult and aged rhesus macaques to develop a potential model for testing Alzheimer's disease interventions. Monkeys were injected with the noradrenergic neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4) or vehicle at 0, 3, and 6 months; brains were harvested at 9 months. Reduced norepinephrine in the locus coeruleus was accompanied by decreased dopamine beta-hydroxylase staining and increased amyloid-beta load in the aged group, and the proportion of potentially toxic amyloid-beta42 peptide was increased. Immunohistochemistry revealed no effects on microglia or astrocytes. DSP4 treatment altered amyloid processing, but these changes were not associated with the induction of chronic neuroinflammation. These findings suggest norepinephrine deregulation is an essential component of a nonhuman primate model of Alzheimer's disease, but further refinement is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence indicates that the polygenic basis of late-onset Alzheimer's disease can be harnessed to identify individuals at greatest risk for cognitive decline. We have previously developed and validated a polygenic hazard score comprising of 31 single nucleotide polymorphisms for predicting Alzheimer's disease dementia age of onset. In this study, we examined whether polygenic hazard scores are associated with: (i) regional tracer uptake using amyloid PET; (ii) regional volume loss using longitudinal MRI; (iii) post-mortem regional amyloid-beta protein and tau associated neurofibrillary tangles; and (iv) four common non-Alzheimer's pathologies. Even after accounting for APOE, we found a strong association between polygenic hazard scores and amyloid PET standard uptake volume ratio with the largest effects within frontal cortical regions in 980 older individuals across the disease spectrum, and longitudinal MRI volume loss within the entorhinal cortex in 607 older individuals across the disease spectrum. We also found that higher polygenic hazard scores were associated with greater rates of cognitive and clinical decline in 632 non-demented older individuals, even after controlling for APOE status, frontal amyloid PET and entorhinal cortex volume. In addition, the combined model that included polygenic hazard scores, frontal amyloid PET and entorhinal cortex volume resulted in a better fit compared to a model with only imaging markers. Neuropathologically, we found that polygenic hazard scores were associated with regional post-mortem amyloid load and neuronal neurofibrillary tangles, even after accounting for APOE, validating our imaging findings. Lastly, polygenic hazard scores were associated with Lewy body and cerebrovascular pathology. Beyond APOE, we show that in living subjects, polygenic hazard scores were associated with amyloid deposition and neurodegeneration in susceptible brain regions. Polygenic hazard scores may also be useful for the identification of individuals at the highest risk for developing multi-aetiological dementia.",

    "title": "Imaging of tau deposits in adults with Niemann-Pick type C disease: a case-control study.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a cholesterol storage disease characterized by disruption in the endosomal-lysosomal transport system that leads to the accumulation of cholesterol and glycolipids in lysosomes. Developmental cognitive delay and progressive motor and cognitive impairment are characteristic of the disease. Tau accumulation has been reported in some NPC patients. We investigated the presence of tau and Abeta-amyloid deposits in a group of NPC patients and for comparison in age-matched healthy controls (HC). METHODS: Eight NPC patients and seven HC were included in the study. Participants underwent tau imaging with 18F-AV1451 and amyloid imaging with 11C-PiB. Both 18F-AV1451 and 11C-PiB standardized uptake value ratios were generated using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. Associations between imaging results, and clinical and neurocognitive parameters were assessed through nonparametric analyses. RESULTS: All participants were Abeta-negative. Four NPC patients presented with high tau burden in the brain. A 21-year-old female patient and a 40-year-old male patient showed high neocortical tau burden in a pattern different from that observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease, while the same 40-year-old male patient, a 40-year-old female patient and a 50-year-old female patient showed high regional tau burden in the mesial temporal cortex. Spearman's correlation analysis showed an association between tau burden in the mesial temporal lobe and age (p = 0.022), and age at symptom onset (p = 0.009), and between frontotemporal tau and duration of symptoms (p = 0.027). There were no correlations between global and regional tau and cognitive parameters. CONCLUSION: Four of eight NPC patients showed tau deposition in the brain. The results of our exploratory study suggest that while tau deposits do not affect cognitive performance, tau deposits are associated with measures of disease onset and progression. Further studies in a larger cohort of NPC patients are needed to confirm these initial findings.",

We found in ApoE-deficient mice that oxidized lipids activated the classical complement cascade (CCC), resulting in leukocyte infiltration of the choroid plexus (ChP). All human ApoE isoforms attenuated CCC activity via high-affinity binding to the activated CCC-initiating C1q protein (KD~140-580 pM) in vitro, and C1q-ApoE complexes emerged as markers for ongoing complement activity of diseased ChPs, Abeta plaques, and atherosclerosis in vivo. C1q-ApoE complexes in human ChPs, Abeta plaques, and arteries correlated with cognitive decline and atherosclerosis, respectively. Treatment with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against C5, which is formed by all complement pathways, attenuated murine ChP inflammation, Abeta-associated microglia accumulation, and atherosclerosis. Thus, ApoE is a direct checkpoint inhibitor of unresolvable inflammation, and reducing C5 attenuates disease burden.",

By fabricating and combining two immunosensors for Abetao and Abetaf, respectively, we constructed a two-channel electrochemical system. The ratio of Abetaf to Abetao was calculated and taken as a possible criterion for evaluating the extent of aggregation. Thereby, the presence of and transformation between oligomers and fibrils were accurately probed by incubating the Abeta monomer for different times and then calculating the ratios of Abetaf to Abetao. The applicability of this method was further validated by tracking the dynamic progress of Abeta aggregation in the cerebrospinal fluid and tissues of Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats, which revealed that the ratio of Abetaf to Abetao in rat brain gradually increased with the progression of AD, which was indicative of the severity of peptide aggregation during this process. Overall, this study represents the first example of a quantitative strategy for precisely evaluating the aggregation process that is related to pathological events in AD brain.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral blood-derived macrophages isolated from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients have earlier been reported to demonstrate ineffective phagocytosis of amyloid-beta compared to the age-matched control subjects. However, the mechanisms causing unsuccessful phagocytosis remain unclear. Oxidative stress and the presence of ApoEepsilon4 allele has been reported to play a major role in the pathogenesis of AD, but the contribution of oxidative stress and ApoEepsilon4 in macrophage dysfunction leading to ineffective Abeta phagocytosis needs to be analyzed. Abeta phagocytosis assay has been performed using FITC-labeled Abeta and analyzed using flow cytometry and confocal imaging in patient samples and in THP-1 cells. Oxidative stress in patient-derived macrophages was analyzed by assessing the DNA damage using comet assay. ApoE polymorphism was analyzed using sequence-specific PCR and Hixson & Vernier Restriction isotyping protocol. In this study, we have analyzed the patterns of phagocytic inefficiency of macrophages in Indian population with a gradual decline in the phagocytic potential from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD patients. Further, we have shown that the presence of ApoEepsilon4 allele might also have a possible effect on the phagocytosis efficiency of the macrophages. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that oxidative stress could affect the amyloid-beta phagocytic potential of macrophages and hence by alleviating oxidative stress using curcumin, an anti-oxidant could enhance the amyloid-beta phagocytic efficacy of macrophages of patients with AD and MCI, although the responsiveness to curcumin might depends on the presence or absence of APOEepsilon4 allele. Oxidative stress contributes significantly to decreased phagocytosis of Abeta by macrophages. Moreover, the phagocytic inefficiency of macrophages was correlated to the presence of ApoEepsilon4 allele. This study also found that the Abeta-phagocytic potential of macrophage gets significantly enhanced in curcumin-treated patient-derived macrophages.",

Additionally, this tool is also used to understand whether the side chain of a specific amino acid residue plays a role in the protein's bioactivity. Furthermore, computational alanine scanning methods are utilized to predict the thermodynamic properties of proteins. These studies are utilized with the assumption that the biochemical and biophysical properties of a protein do not change with alanine scanning. Our study was dedicated to analyze the effect of alanine scanning on the biochemical and biophysical properties of intrinsically disordered proteins. To this end, we studied the impact of widely used histidine to alanine mutations in amyloid-beta (Abeta). We found that the secondary and tertiary contacts, salt bridge formations, and thermodynamic properties, as well as disorder propensities and aggregation predisposition of Abeta, are impacted by the single and triple point histidine to alanine mutations. Experimental and computational studies employing the alanine scanning technique for mutating histidine to alanine in the analysis of intrinsically disordered proteins have to consider these effects.",

Moreover, a similar phenotype appears in NP cells and cerebral organoids derived from APOE4 iPSCs. Impaired function of the transcriptional repressor REST is strongly implicated in the altered transcriptome and differentiation state. SAD and APOE4 expression result in reduced REST nuclear translocation and chromatin binding, and disruption of the nuclear lamina. Thus, dysregulation of neural gene networks may set in motion the pathologic cascade that leads to AD.",

    "title": "Conditional BDNF Delivery from Astrocytes Rescues Memory Deficits, Spine Density, and Synaptic Properties in the 5xFAD Mouse Model of Alzheimer Disease.",
    "abstract": "It has been well documented that neurotrophins, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), are severely affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their administration faces a myriad of technical challenges. Here we took advantage of the early astrogliosis observed in an amyloid mouse model of AD (5xFAD) and used it as an internal sensor to administer BDNF conditionally and locally. We first demonstrate the relevance of BDNF release from astrocytes by evaluating the effects of coculturing WT neurons and BDNF-deficient astrocytes. Next, we crossed 5xFAD mice with pGFAP:BDNF mice (only males were used) to create 5xFAD mice that overexpress BDNF when and where astrogliosis is initiated (5xF:pGB mice). We evaluated the behavioral phenotype of these mice. We first found that BDNF from astrocytes is crucial for dendrite outgrowth and spine number in cultured WT neurons. Double-mutant 5xF:pGB mice displayed improvements in cognitive tasks compared with 5xFAD littermates. In these mice, there was a rescue of BDNF/TrkB downstream signaling activity associated with an improvement of dendritic spine density and morphology. Clusters of synaptic markers, PSD-95 and synaptophysin, were also recovered in 5xF:pGB compared with 5xFAD mice as well as the number of presynaptic vesicles at excitatory synapses. Additionally, experimentally evoked LTP in vivo was increased in 5xF:pGB mice. The beneficial effects of conditional BDNF production and local delivery at the location of active neuropathology highlight the potential to use endogenous biomarkers with early onset, such as astrogliosis, as regulators of neurotrophic therapy in AD.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Recent evidence places astrocytes as pivotal players during synaptic plasticity and memory processes. In the present work, we first provide evidence that astrocytes are essential for neuronal morphology via BDNF release. We then crossed transgenic mice (5xFAD mice) with the transgenic pGFAP-BDNF mice, which express BDNF under the GFAP promoter. The resultant double-mutant mice 5xF:pGB mice displayed a full rescue of hippocampal BDNF loss and related signaling compared with 5xFAD mice and a significant and specific improvement in all the evaluated cognitive tasks. These improvements did not correlate with amelioration of beta amyloid load or hippocampal adult neurogenesis rate but were accompanied by a dramatic recovery of structural and functional synaptic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "BACE1 is a beta-secretase involved in the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The entorhinal cortex and the dentate gyrus are important for learning and memory, which are affected in the early stages of AD. Since BACE1 is a potential target for AD therapy, it is crucial to understand its physiological role in these brain regions. Here, we examined the function of BACE1 in the dentate gyrus. We show that loss of BACE1 in the dentate gyrus leads to increased granule cell excitability, indicated by enhanced efficiency of synaptic potentials to generate granule cell spikes. The increase in granule cell excitability was accompanied by prolonged paired-pulse inhibition, altered network gamma oscillations, and impaired synaptic plasticity at entorhinal-dentate synapses of the perforant path. In summary, this is the first detailed electrophysiological study of BACE1 deletion at the network level in vivo. The results suggest that BACE1 is important for normal dentate gyrus network function. This has implications for the use of BACE1 inhibitors as therapeutics for AD therapy, since BACE1 inhibition could similarly disrupt synaptic plasticity and excitability in the entorhinal-dentate circuitry.",

The study aims to identify amyloid deposition patterns and clinical features associated with this mutation. METHODS: we analyzed the clinical manifestations, brain neuroimages and 18F-AV-45 positron emission tomography (PET) findings in symptomatic patients and asymptomatic subjects with the autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease (AD). We compared the amyloid deposition pattern among 10 patients with genetically-positive familial cognitive decline (CD), 18 patients with sporadic CD, and 19 healthy controls. RESULTS: The clinical features were the early onset of memory impairment in all 10 patients and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in 3 patients. The characteristic results of brain 18F-AV-45 PET included the highest standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) in the occipital and cerebellar cortical areas in the genetically-positive CD patients. In subgroup analysis, the familial AD patients had a decreased amyloid SUVR trend in most areas except for cerebellar cortex compared to those with familial mild cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that the familial D678H gene mutation have resulted in a more potent amyloid burden than in the patients with sporadic AD patients. The high amyloid uptake in the occipital area is characteristic of the specific Taiwan APP gene.",

    "title": "Applicability of in vivo staging of regional amyloid burden in a cognitively normal cohort with subjective memory complaints: the INSIGHT-preAD study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current methods of amyloid PET interpretation based on the binary classification of global amyloid signal fail to identify early phases of amyloid deposition. A recent analysis of 18F-florbetapir PET data from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort suggested a hierarchical four-stage model of regional amyloid deposition that resembles neuropathologic estimates and can be used to stage an individual's amyloid burden in vivo. Here, we evaluated the validity of this in vivo amyloid staging model in an independent cohort of older people with subjective memory complaints (SMC). We further examined its potential association with subtle cognitive impairments in this population at elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: The monocentric INSIGHT-preAD cohort includes 318 cognitively intact older individuals with SMC. All individuals underwent 18F-florbetapir PET scanning and extensive neuropsychological testing. We projected the regional amyloid uptake signal into the previously proposed hierarchical staging model of in vivo amyloid progression. We determined the adherence to this model across all cases and tested the association between increasing in vivo amyloid stage and cognitive performance using ANCOVA models. RESULTS: In total, 156 participants (49%) showed evidence of regional amyloid deposition, and all but 2 of these (99%) adhered to the hierarchical regional pattern implied by the in vivo amyloid progression model. According to a conventional binary classification based on global signal (SUVRCereb = 1.10), individuals in stages III and IV were classified as amyloid-positive (except one in stage III), but 99% of individuals in stage I and even 28% of individuals in stage II were classified as amyloid-negative. Neither in vivo amyloid stage nor conventional binary amyloid status was significantly associated with cognitive performance in this preclinical cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed hierarchical staging scheme of PET-evidenced amyloid deposition generalizes well to data from an independent cohort of older people at elevated risk for AD. Future studies will determine the prognostic value of the staging approach for predicting longitudinal cognitive decline in older individuals at increased risk for AD.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is involved in the aggregation of misfolded amyloid beta (Abeta), which upregulates the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), enhances neuroinflammation, and eventually leads to neuronal death. Therefore, compounds targeting these mechanisms may be candidates for multitarget drugs in AD treatment. We found that two quinoline derivatives, VB-030 and VB-037, markedly reduced Abeta aggregation and ROS levels in the thioflavin T biochemical assay and Tet-On Abeta-green fluorescent protein (GFP) 293 AD cell model. These compounds further improved neurite outgrowth, reduced AChE activity and upregulated the molecular chaperone heat shock protein family B [small] member 1 (HSP27), whereas knockdown of HSP27 counteracted the compounds' neuroprotective effects on the Tet-On Abeta-GFP SH-SY5Y AD neuronal model. Furthermore, VB-037 attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/interferon (IFN)-gamma-induced activation of BV-2 microglial cells. In addition, VB-037 demonstrated its potential to diminish LPS/IFN-gamma-induced upregulation of caspase 1 activity, expression of interleukin (IL)-1beta, and active phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (P38), mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (JNK), and Jun proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (JUN) signalings, as well as improve cell viability in the Tet-On Abeta-GFP SH-SY5Y AD neuronal model. Our findings strongly indicate the potential of VB-037 for modifying AD progression by targeting multiple mechanisms, thereby offering a new drug development avenue for AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Structural characterization of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is paramount and challenging in structural biology. In this regard, a de novo computational protocol is introduced to build heterogeneous structural libraries for amyloid-beta (Abeta) as a critical IDP. This method combines the strength of the simulated annealing - in jumping over energy barriers and escaping from traps - with short conventional molecular dynamics simulations to quickly explore local regions of the conformational space. The protocol efficiency and reliability in building Abeta conformational library is compared with two widely used simulation methods, replica exchange molecular dynamics and multiple trajectory sampling. The probability distribution functions of various structural and energetic features are constructed for each library, and also the diversity and convergence rates in these protocols were compared. Our results show that the suggested protocol is a successful computational method in the generation of a diverse conformational library of the Abeta monomer in agreement with experimental data. This method focuses on visiting more conformations in less computational time without paying attention to the statistical weight of each state in the library. We believe that the suggested computational technique can be used for generating a reasonable starting pool for subsequent reweighting with experimental data to obtain a statistical ensemble.",

Neurobiological factors underlying gender differences in AD remain unclear. This study investigated brain beta-amyloid (Abeta)-related neural system differences in cognitively normal older men and women (N = 61; 41 females, 65-93 years old). We found that men and women showed different associations between Abeta load and hippocampal functional connectivity. During associative memory encoding, in men greater Abeta burden was accompanied by greater hippocampus-prefrontal connectivity (i.e., more synchronized activities), whereas in women hippocampal connectivity did not vary by Abeta burden. For resting-state data, the interaction of gender x Abeta on hippocampal connectivity did not survive multiple comparison in the whole-brain analyses. In the region of interest-based analyses, resting-state hippocampal-prefrontal connectivity was positively correlated with Abeta load in men and was negatively correlated with Abeta load in women. The observed Abeta-related neural differences may explain the accelerated trajectory of cognitive decline and AD progression in women.",

    "abstract": "The self-assembly of Abeta to beta-sheet-rich neurotoxic oligomers is a main pathological event leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Selective targeting of Abeta oligomers without affecting other functional proteins is therefore an attractive approach to prevent the disease and its progression. In this study, we report that photodynamic treatment of Abeta in the presence of catalytic amounts of chlorin e6 can selectively damage Abeta and inhibit its aggregation and toxicity. Chlorin e6 also reversed the amyloid aggregation process in the dark by binding its soluble and low molecular weight oligomers, as shown by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence and photoinduced cross-linking of unmodified protein (PICUP) methods. Using HSQC NMR spectroscopy, ThT assays, amino acid analysis, SDS/PAGE, and EPR spectroscopy, we show that catalytic amounts of photoexcited chlorin e6 selectively damage the Abeta histidine residues H6, H13, and H14, and induce Abeta cross-linking by generating singlet oxygen. In contrast, photoexcited chlorin e6 was unable to cross-link ubiquitin and alpha-synuclein, demonstrating its high selectivity for Abeta. By binding to the Abeta histidine residues, catalytic amounts of chlorin e6 can also inhibit the Cu2+-induced aggregation and toxicity in darkness, while at stoichiometric amounts it acts as a chelator to reduce the amount of free Cu2+. This study demonstrates the great potential of chlorin e6 as a multifunctional agent for treatment of AD, and shows that the three N-terminal Abeta histidine residues are a suitable target for Abeta-specific drugs.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have suggested a positive correlation between saturated fat intake and the risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). While diets-enriched in the saturated free fatty acid (sFFA) palmitate has been shown to induce cognitive dysfunction and AD-like pathology, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as linoleate have been suggested to protect against AD in mouse models. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate the deleterious effects of palmitate or the protective effects of linoleate remain to be characterized. We fed 9-month-old cohorts of triple transgenic AD mice (3xTg-AD) and their-matched controls with a palmitate-enriched/linoleate-deficient diet for three months and determined the impact of the diet on oxidative stress, Bace1 promoter transactivation status, and amyloid-beta (Abeta) burden. The palmitate-enriched/linoleate-deficient diet causes a profound increase in oxidative stress burden characterized by significant oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids concomitant with deficits in the endogenous antioxidant defense capacity in the hippocampi of 3xTg-AD mice. These effects were also associated with increased NF-kappaB transcriptional activity resulting in NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation of the Bace1 promoter that culminated in higher BACE1 expression and activity, and Abeta production. Our study unveils a novel mechanism by which a diet enriched in the sFFA palmitate and deficient in the PUFA linoleate exacerbates AD-like pathology involving signaling cross-talk between oxidative stress and NF-kappaB activation as a critical underlying factor in upregulating BACE1 activity and increasing Abeta burden.",

    "title": "Sex Differences in the Association of Global Amyloid and Regional Tau Deposition Measured by Positron Emission Tomography in Clinically Normal Older Adults.",
    "abstract": "Importance: Mounting evidence suggests that sex differences exist in the pathologic trajectory of Alzheimer disease. Previous literature shows elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid tau in women compared with men as a function of apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 status and beta-amyloid (Abeta). What remains unclear is the association of sex with regional tau deposition in clinically normal individuals. Objective: To examine sex differences in the cross-sectional association between Abeta and regional tau deposition as measured with positron emission tomography (PET). Design, Setting and Participants: This is a study of 2 cross-sectional, convenience-sampled cohorts of clinically normal individuals who received tau and Abeta PET scans. Data were collected between January 2016 and February 2018 from 193 clinically normal individuals from the Harvard Aging Brain Study (age range, 55-92 years; 118 women [61%]) who underwent carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B and flortaucipir F18 PET and 103 clinically normal individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (age range, 63-94 years; 55 women [51%]) who underwent florbetapir and flortaucipir F 18 PET. Main Outcomes and Measures: A main association of sex with regional tau in the entorhinal cortices, inferior temporal lobe, and a meta-region of interest, which was a composite of regions in the temporal lobe. Associations between sex and global Abeta as well as sex and APOE epsilon4 on these regions after controlling for age were also examined. Results: The mean (SD) age of all individuals was 74.2 (7.6) years (81 APOE epsilon4 carriers [31%]; 89 individuals [30%] with high Abeta). There was no clear association of sex with regional tau that was replicated across studies. However, in both cohorts, clinically normal women exhibited higher entorhinal cortical tau than men (meta-analytic estimate: beta [male] = -0.11 [0.05]; 95% CI, -0.21 to -0.02; P = .02), which was associated with individuals with higher Abeta burden. A sex by APOE epsilon4 interaction was not associated with regional tau (meta-analytic estimate: beta [male, APOE epsilon4+] = -0.15 [0.09]; 95% CI, -0.32 to 0.01; P = .07). Conclusions and Relevance: Early tau deposition was elevated in women compared with men in individuals on the Alzheimer disease trajectory. These findings lend support to a growing body of literature that highlights a biological underpinning for sex differences in Alzheimer disease risk.",

    "abstract": "Intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid-beta(1-42) (Abeta1-42) is one of the earliest signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) have profound influence on the cellular uptake of Abeta1-42 by mediating its attachment and subsequent internalization into the cells. Colocalization of amyloid plaques with members of the syndecan family of HSPGs, along with the increased expression of syndecan-3 and -4 have already been reported in postmortem AD brains. Considering the growing evidence on the involvement of syndecans in the pathogenesis of AD, we analyzed the contribution of syndecans to cellular uptake and fibrillation of Abeta1-42. Among syndecans, the neuron specific syndecan-3 isoform increased cellular uptake of Abeta1-42 the most. Kinetics of Abeta1-42 uptake also proved to be fairly different among SDC family members: syndecan-3 increased Abeta1-42 uptake from the earliest time points, while other syndecans facilitated Abeta1-42 internalization at a slower pace. Internalized Abeta1-42 colocalized with syndecans and flotillins, highlighting the role of lipid-rafts in syndecan-mediated uptake. Syndecan-3 and 4 also triggered fibrillation of Abeta1-42, further emphasizing the pathophysiological relevance of syndecans in plaque formation. Overall our data highlight syndecans, especially the neuron-specific syndecan-3 isoform, as important players in amyloid pathology and show that syndecans, regardless of cell type, facilitate key molecular events in neurodegeneration.",

Its incidence is increasing annually and no effective therapeutic treatment currently exists. In the present study, salidroside, a major active ingredient of Rhodiola rosea, was able to protect PC-12 cells from the toxicity and apoptosis induced by AD inducer amyloid (A)beta1-42. Salidroside significantly protected PC-12 cells by inhibiting Abeta1-42-induced cytotoxicity and mitochondria-mediated endogenous caspase apoptotic pathways. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that salidroside significantly activated the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathways. This observation was further confirmed using the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 and the AKT inhibitor LY294002, which demonstrated that salidroside promoted PC-12 cell survival and proliferation by activating the ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways. Salidroside is a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of AD and provides a basis for further drug development.",

The heparin-induced tau filaments differ from those of Alzheimer's or Pick's disease, which have larger cores with different repeat compositions. Our results illustrate the structural versatility of amyloid filaments, and raise questions about the relevance of in vitro assembly.",

    "abstract": "The main pathophysiological alterations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include loss of neuronal and synaptic integrity, amyloidogenic processing, and neuroinflammation. Similar alterations can, however, also be observed in cognitively intact older subjects and may prelude the clinical manifestation of AD. The objectives of this prospective cross-sectional study in a cohort of 38 cognitively intact older adults were twofold: (i) to investigate the latent relationship among cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers reflecting the main pathophysiological processes of AD, and (ii) to assess the correlation between these biomarkers and gray matter volume as well as amyloid load. All subjects underwent extensive neuropsychological examinations, CSF sampling, [18 F]-flutemetamol amyloid positron emission tomography, and T1 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging. A factor analysis revealed one factor that explained most of the variance in the CSF biomarker dataset clustering t-tau, alpha-synuclein, p-tau181 , neurogranin, BACE1, visinin-like protein 1, chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-38 . Higher scores on this factor correlated with lower gray matter volume and with higher amyloid load in the precuneus. At the level of individual CSF biomarkers, levels of visinin-like protein 1, neurogranin, BACE1, Abeta1-40 , Abeta1-38, and YKL-40 all correlated inversely with gray matter volume of the precuneus. These findings demonstrate that in cognitively intact older subjects, CSF levels of synaptic and neuronal integrity biomarkers, amyloidogenic processing and measures of innate immunity (YKL-40) display a latent structure of common variance, which is associated with loss of structural integrity of brain regions implicated in the earliest stages of AD.

    "title": "Coimmunocapture and Electrochemical Quantitation of Total and Phosphorylated Amyloid-beta40 Monomers.",
    "abstract": "Phosphorylated proteins play important roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The most abundant constituent in AD's brain deposit is the amyloid-beta40 peptide (Abeta40). Based on it, the degree of phosphorylated Abeta40 in body fluids (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, CSF), which is defined by the ratio of phosphorylated Abeta40 to total Abeta40 (pAbeta40/tAbeta40), is anticipated to be an index for early diagnosis of AD. The major challenge in pAbeta40/tAbeta40 detection is the large concentration difference between two Abeta40 forms in the real samples, which usually requires multichannel equipment and complicated detection process. In this paper, we revealed the unexpected close affinities of the anti-Abeta40 antibody to Abeta40 (40.2 nM-1) and to pAbeta40 (42.3 nM-1). Based on it, a convenient coimmunocapture and electrochemical quantitation of tAbeta40 and pAbeta40 was achieved on an anti-Abeta40 antibody immobilized Au electrode (anti-Abeta40/Au). Once Abeta40 and pAbeta40 were synchronously captured on the anti-Abeta40/Au electrode, the tAbeta40 levels in CSF samples were quantified with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. With the signal amplification from Cd2+/Ti4+-functionalized titanium phosphate nanospheres (Cd2+/Ti4+@TiP) which was selective conjugated to pAbeta40, concentrations of low abundant pAbeta40 as low as 1 fM were readily measured by square wave voltammetry. Our results reveal that despite the concentrations of tAbeta40 and pAbeta40 fluctuate in each individual case, the concentration ratios of pAbeta40/tAbeta40 in CSF samples from AD patients are significant larger than those from healthy donors. It demonstrates that the degree of phosphorylated Abeta40 is hopeful to be an effective index for evaluating the AD progress and improving the accuracy of clinic AD diagnosis.",

    "title": "Beta-amyloid pathology in human brain microvessel extracts from the parietal cortex: relation with cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Several pieces of evidence suggest that blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), exemplified by the frequent occurrence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and the defective clearance of Abeta peptides. However, the specific role of brain microvascular cells in these anomalies remains elusive. In this study, we validated by Western, ELISA and immunofluorescence analyses a procedure to generate microvasculature-enriched fractions from frozen samples of human cerebral cortex. We then investigated Abeta and proteins involved in its clearance or production in microvessel extracts generated from the parietal cortex of 60 volunteers in the Religious Orders Study. Volunteers were categorized as AD (n = 38) or controls (n = 22) based on the ABC scoring method presented in the revised guidelines for the neuropathological diagnosis of AD. Higher ELISA-determined concentrations of vascular Abeta40 and Abeta42 were found in persons with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD, in apoE4 carriers and in participants with advanced parenchymal CAA, compared to respective age-matched controls. Vascular levels of two proteins involved in Abeta clearance, ABCB1 and neprilysin, were lower in persons with AD and positively correlated with cognitive function, while being inversely correlated to vascular Abeta40. In contrast, BACE1, a protein necessary for Abeta production, was increased in individuals with AD and in apoE4 carriers, negatively correlated to cognitive function and positively correlated to Abeta40 in microvessel extracts. The present report indicates that concentrating microvessels from frozen human brain samples facilitates the quantitative biochemical analysis of cerebrovascular dysfunction in CNS disorders. Data generated overall show that microvessels extracted from individuals with parenchymal CAA-AD contained more Abeta and BACE1 and less ABCB1 and neprilysin, evidencing a pattern of dysfunction in brain microvascular cells contributing to CAA and AD pathology and symptoms.",

We synthesized an [Met35(O)]Abeta42 possessing a covalently bound lactam tether as an Asp23/Lys28 salt-bridge surrogate (compound 3). The lactam tether of 3 markedly promoted the formation of stable protofibril-like species that exhibited amyloidogenic properties such as a cross-beta-sheet structure and cytotoxicity.

    "title": "Serotonin type 6 receptor antagonist attenuates the impairment of long-term potentiation and memory induced by Abeta.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, characterized by memory impairment and synaptic loss. Long-term potentiation (LTP), a type of synaptic plasticity, is impaired during AD. Serotonin type 6 receptor (5-HT6R) inactivation is proposed as a therapeutic target for AD. This study examined the effects of chronic administration of the 5-HT6R antagonist, SB-258585, on cognitive, memory, and hippocampal plasticity in a rat model of AD. Abeta neurotoxicity was induced in rats using Abeta (1.35 pmol intracerebroventricular [ICV] injection). The following groups were formed: control sustained surgery and saline-treated, Abeta+saline (1 muL ICV for 30 days), and Abeta+SB-258585 (0.024 mg/kg, ICV for 30 days). The learning and memory were tested using the novel object recognition and passive avoidance tests. Next, anesthetized rats were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. The population spike (PS) amplitude and the slope of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) of the LTP were measured following high-frequency stimulation in the dentate gyrus. The Abeta injection reduced step-through latency in the passive avoidance test and decreased the discrimination index in the novel object test. Abeta diminished both the amplitude of hippocampal neuron population spikes and the slope of excitatory postsynaptic potentials, compared to the control group. The administration of SB-258585 in rats receiving Abeta attenuated the Abeta-induced deficits in cognition, memory, and LTP in comparison with the Abeta group. It can be concluded that chronic treatment with SB-258585 antagonist can prevent Abeta-related deficiencies in learning and memory performance by improving neuronal plasticity. SB-258585 can prevent the progression of AD.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrovascular alterations are a key feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, whether vascular damage contributes to synaptic dysfunction and how it synergizes with amyloid pathology to cause neuroinflammation and cognitive decline remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the blood protein fibrinogen induces spine elimination and promotes cognitive deficits mediated by CD11b-CD18 microglia activation. 3D molecular labeling in cleared mouse and human AD brains combined with repetitive in vivo two-photon imaging showed focal fibrinogen deposits associated with loss of dendritic spines independent of amyloid plaques. Fibrinogen-induced spine elimination was prevented by inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation or genetic ablation of CD11b. Genetic elimination of the fibrinogen binding motif to CD11b reduced neuroinflammation, synaptic deficits, and cognitive decline in the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. Thus, fibrinogen-induced spine elimination and cognitive decline via CD11b link cerebrovascular damage with immune-mediated neurodegeneration and may have important implications in AD and related conditions.",

    "title": "Cerebral Amyloid-beta Deposition Is Associated with Impaired Gait Speed and Lower Extremity Function.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Impaired physical function (i.e., slowing of gait, muscle weakness, and poor mobility) is common in older adults with cognitive impairment and dementia. Evidence suggests that cerebral small vessel disease, specifically white matter lesions (WMLs), is associated with impaired physical function, but little research has been conducted to understand the specific role of Alzheimer's disease pathology in physical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the association between cerebral amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and physical function in people with cognitive impairment. METHODS: Thirty participants completed an 11C Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) position emission tomography (PET) scan to quantify global Abeta deposition using standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). We assessed usual gait speed, muscle strength of the lower extremities, balance, and functional mobility using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and the Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT). Multiple linear regression analyses examined the association between Abeta and each measure of physical function, adjusting for age, body mass index, and WML load. RESULTS: Global PIB SUVR was significantly associated with usual gait speed (beta= -0.52, p = 0.01) and SPPB performance (beta= -0.47, p = 0.02), such that increased Abeta deposition was associated with reduced performance on both measures. Global PIB SUVR was not significantly associated with TUGT performance (beta= 0.32, p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral Abeta deposition is associated with reduced gait speed, muscle strength, and balance in older adults with cognitive impairment independent of WML load. However, Abeta deposition was not associated with functional mobility.",

This first-in-human dose ascending study assessed pharmacokinetics (PK) (measured as serum free LY2599666 concentration) and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects (measured as plasma total soluble Abeta40 and Abeta42) after a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of 10, 25, 100, and 200 mg LY2599666 in healthy subjects. As LY2599666 binds to multiple soluble Abeta monomers, a two-target mediated drug disposition model (TMDD) was developed to simultaneously fit serum LY2599666 concentration and Abeta monomer levels. Four Alzheimer's disease patients completed 25 mg once-weekly dosing of LY2599666 for 12 weeks. In addition, single cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected to assess penetration capability across the blood-brain barrier. PK and PD data collected from the multiple dose cohort aligned with model predictions, suggesting the established TMDD model predicted suppression of soluble Abeta40 and Abeta42 in plasma after SC dosing of LY2599666.",

    "abstract": "Carrying the epsilon4 allele of the APOE gene encoding apolipoprotein E (APOE4) markedly increases the risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which APOE4 exacerbates the brain accumulation and subsequent deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. While the LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a major apoE receptor in the brain, we found that its levels are associated with those of insoluble Abeta depending on APOE genotype status in postmortem AD brains. Thus, to determine the functional interaction of apoE4 and LRP1 in brain Abeta metabolism, we crossed neuronal LRP1-knockout mice with amyloid model APP/PS1 mice and APOE3-targeted replacement (APO3-TR) or APOE4-TR mice. Consistent with previous findings, mice expressing apoE4 had increased Abeta deposition and insoluble amounts of Abeta40 and Abeta42 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice compared with those expressing apoE3. Intriguingly, such effects were reversed in the absence of neuronal LRP1. Neuronal LRP1 deficiency also increased detergent-soluble apoE4 levels, which may contribute to the inhibition of Abeta deposition. Together, our results suggest that apoE4 exacerbates Abeta pathology through a mechanism that depends on neuronal LRP1. A better understanding of apoE isoform-specific interaction with their metabolic receptor LRP1 on Abeta metabolism is crucial for defining APOE4-related risk for AD.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral blood flow (CBF) reductions in Alzheimer's disease patients and related mouse models have been recognized for decades, but the underlying mechanisms and resulting consequences for Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis remain poorly understood. In APP/PS1 and 5xFAD mice we found that an increased number of cortical capillaries had stalled blood flow as compared to in wild-type animals, largely due to neutrophils that had adhered in capillary segments and blocked blood flow. Administration of antibodies against the neutrophil marker Ly6G reduced the number of stalled capillaries, leading to both an immediate increase in CBF and rapidly improved performance in spatial and working memory tasks. This study identified a previously uncharacterized cellular mechanism that explains the majority of the CBF reduction seen in two mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and demonstrated that improving CBF rapidly enhanced short-term memory function. Restoring cerebral perfusion by preventing neutrophil adhesion may provide a strategy for improving cognition in Alzheimer's disease patients.",

Using data for 149 participants (345 visits) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, we assessed whether the average of early amyloid frames (EA) and R1 computed from dynamic 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET can serve as surrogates of rCBF computed from 15O-H2O-PET. R1 had the highest longitudinal test-retest reliability. Interquartile range (IQR) of cross-sectional Pearson correlations with rCBF was 0.60-0.72 for EA and 0.63-0.72 for R1. Correlations between rates of change were lower (IQR 0.22-0.50 for EA, 0.25-0.55 for R1). Values in the Alzheimer's metabolic signature meta-ROI were negatively associated with age and exhibited longitudinal declines for each PET measure. In age-adjusted analyses, meta-ROI rCBF and R1 were lower among amyloid+ individuals; EA and R1 were lower among males. Regional PiB-based measures, in particular R1, can be suitable surrogates of rCBF.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Randomized placebo-controlled trials in the development of disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease are typically of short duration (12-18 months), and health economic modeling requires extrapolation of treatment effects beyond the trial period. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether observational data can be used to extrapolate data from open-label trials, we compared outcomes (cognition, function, behavior) over 36 months for patients with mild Alzheimer's disease dementia in the GERAS observational study (proxy for placebo control) with those of the mild Alzheimer's disease population on active treatment (solanezumab) in two 18-month randomized placebo-controlled trials (EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION2) and the additional 18-month open-label extension study (EXPEDITION-EXT). DESIGN AND SETTING: Analysis of longitudinal data from patients with mild Alzheimer's disease dementia in the GERAS observational study (conducted in France, Germany and the United Kingdom) and the EXPEDITION program (conducted in Europe, North America, South America, Asia and Australia). PARTICIPANTS: European and North American community-living patients, aged >=55 years, with probable Alzheimer's disease dementia and their caregivers. Mild Alzheimer's disease dementia was defined as a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 20-26 in EXPEDITION and 21-26 in GERAS. INTERVENTION: Active treatment in both randomized placebo-controlled trials and the open-label extension study was intravenous solanezumab 400 mg every 4 weeks. Patients in GERAS were receiving treatment as part of standard care. MEASUREMENTS: Between-group differences for changes from baseline over 36 months in cognitive function, ability to perform activities of daily living, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia were assessed using models stratified by propensity score. RESULTS: At baseline, patients and caregivers participating in GERAS were significantly older than those in the EXPEDITION studies, and the GERAS patient cohort had fewer years of education and a shorter time since diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The baseline mean Mini-Mental State Examination score of the GERAS cohort was significantly higher (indicating better cognition) than that of patients receiving placebo or active treatment in the pooled EXPEDITION studies Baseline functional ability scores were significantly lower for the GERAS cohort, indicating poorer functioning. Propensity score stratification achieved a good balance in the baseline variables between GERAS and the two EXPEDITION arms. Over 18 months, least squares mean changes from baseline in outcome measures were similar in the GERAS cohort and the pooled placebo groups from the randomized controlled trials. Also, the 18-month results for the comparison between the GERAS cohort and the pooled active treatment groups from the randomized controlled trials were generally similar to those reported for the comparison with the control group in the randomized trial. Comparison of active treatment (EXPEDITION-EXT) and observational study (GERAS, as proxy control) results over 36 months of the open-label trial showed a significantly smaller decline in activities of daily living (instrumental and basic) in the active treatment group, reflecting better functioning, but no between-group differences at 36 months for cognitive function or behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Comparing results from clinical trials and observational studies (real-world data) may be a useful methodological approach for informing long-term outcomes in Alzheimer's disease drug development and could be used to inform health economic modeling. Further research using this methodological approach is needed.",

    "abstract": "As more biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and age-related brain conditions become available, more sophisticated analytic approaches are needed to take full advantage of the information they convey. Most work has been done using categorical approaches but the joint relationships of tau PET, amyloid PET and cortical thickness in their continuous distributions to cognition have been under-explored. We evaluated non-demented subjects over age 50 years in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, 2037 of whom had undergone 3 T MRI scan, 985 amyloid PET scan with 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) and MRI, and 577 PIB-PET, 18F-AV1451 flortaucipir PET and MRI. Participants received a nine-test cognitive battery. Three test scores (logical memory delayed recall, visual reproduction delayed recall and auditory verbal learning test delayed recall) were used to generate a memory composite z-score. We used Gradient Boosting Machine models to analyse the relationship between regional cortical thickness, flortaucipir PET signal, PIB-PET signal and memory z-scores. Age, education, sex and number of test exposures were included in the model as covariates. In this population-based study of non-demented subjects, most of the associations between biomarkers and memory z-scores accrued after 70 years of age. Entorhinal cortex exhibited the strongest associations between biomarkers and memory z-scores. Other temporal regions showed similar but attenuated associations, and non-temporal regions had negligible associations between memory z-scores and biomarkers. Entorhinal flortaucipir PET signal, PIB-PET signal and entorhinal cortical thickness were independently and additively associated with declining memory z-scores. In contrast to global PIB-PET signal where only very high amyloid-beta levels were associated low memory z-scores, entorhinal flortaucipir PET signal just above background levels was associated with low memory z-scores. The lowest memory z-scores occurred with the confluence of elevated entorhinal flortaucipir PET signal and lower entorhinal cortical thickness.",

    "abstract": "The identification of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) pathogenic mutations in familial early onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), along with knowledge that amyloid-beta (Abeta) was the principle protein component of senile plaques, led to the establishment of the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Down syndrome substantiated the hypothesis, given an extra copy of the APP gene and invariable AD pathology hallmarks that occur by middle age. An abundance of support for the amyloid cascade hypothesis followed. Prion-like protein misfolding and non-Mendelian transmission of neurotoxicity are among recent areas of investigation. Abeta-targeted clinical trials have been disappointing, with negative results attributed to inadequacies in patient selection, challenges in pharmacology, and incomplete knowledge of the most appropriate target. There is evidence, however, that proof of concept has been achieved, i.e., clearance of Abeta during life, but with no significant changes in cognitive trajectory in AD. Whether the time, effort, and expense of Abeta-targeted therapy will prove valuable will be determined over time, as Abeta-centered clinical trials continue to dominate therapeutic strategies. It seems reasonable to hypothesize that the amyloid cascade is intimately involved in AD, in parallel with disease pathogenesis, but that removal of toxic Abeta is insufficient for an effective disease modification.",

We developed a mouse model engineered to express poly(PR), a proline-arginine (PR) dipeptide repeat protein synthesized from expanded G4C2 repeats. The expression of green fluorescent protein-conjugated (PR)50 (a 50-repeat PR protein) throughout the mouse brain yielded progressive brain atrophy, neuron loss, loss of poly(PR)-positive cells, and gliosis, culminating in motor and memory impairments. We found that poly(PR) bound DNA, localized to heterochromatin, and caused heterochromatin protein 1alpha (HP1alpha) liquid-phase disruptions, decreases in HP1alpha expression, abnormal histone methylation, and nuclear lamina invaginations. These aberrations of histone methylation, lamins, and HP1alpha, which regulate heterochromatin structure and gene expression, were accompanied by repetitive element expression and double-stranded RNA accumulation. Thus, we uncovered mechanisms by which poly(PR) may contribute to the pathogenesis of C9orf72-associated FTD and ALS.",

Our previous studies reported that phenylethanoid glycosides of CTE have anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD) activity by inhibiting amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) aggregation and deposition. However, recent studies considered that the phenylethanoid glycosides may be metabolized by intestinal bacteria, because all analysis results showed that the bioavailability of phenylethanoid glycosides is extremely low. In this study we demonstrate how iron chelation plays a crucial role in the Abeta aggregation and deposition inhibition mechanism of phenylethanoid glycosides of CTE. In addition, we further proved phenylethanoid glycosides (1-3) could reach brain. Active CTE component and action mechanism confirmation will be a great help for product quality control and bioavailability studies in the future. At the same time, we provide a new analysis method useful in determining phenylethanoid glycosides (1-3) in plants, foods, blood, and tissues for chemical fingerprint and pharmacokinetic research.",

Using three-dimensional mouse brain slice cultures (BSCs), we have developed a paradigm that rapidly and robustly recapitulates mature neurofibrillary inclusion and Lewy body formation found in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, respectively. This was achieved by transducing the BSCs with recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) that express alpha-synuclein or variants of tau. Notably, the tauopathy BSC model enables screening of small molecule therapeutics and tracking of neurodegeneration. More generally, the rAAV BSC \"toolkit\" enables efficient transduction and transgene expression from neurons, microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, alone or in combination, with transgene expression lasting for many months. These rAAV-based BSC models provide a cost-effective and facile alternative to in vivo studies, and in the future can become a widely adopted methodology to explore physiological and pathological mechanisms related to brain function and dysfunction.",

    "title": "Functional connectivity associated with tau levels in ageing, Alzheimer's, and small vessel disease.",
    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease, tau pathology spreads hierarchically from the inferior temporal lobe throughout the cortex, ensuing cognitive decline and dementia. Similarly, circumscribed patterns of pathological tau have been observed in normal ageing and small vessel disease, suggesting a spatially ordered distribution of tau pathology across normal ageing and different diseases. In vitro findings suggest that pathological tau may spread 'prion-like' across neuronal connections in an activity-dependent manner. Supporting this notion, functional brain networks show a spatial correspondence to tau deposition patterns. However, it remains unclear whether higher network-connectivity facilitates tau propagation. To address this, we included 55 normal aged elderly (i.e. cognitively normal, amyloid-negative), 50 Alzheimer's disease patients (i.e. amyloid-positive) covering the preclinical to dementia spectrum, as well as 36 patients with pure (i.e. amyloid-negative) vascular cognitive impairment due to small vessel disease. All subjects were assessed with AV1451 tau-PET and resting-state functional MRI. Within each group, we computed atlas-based resting-state functional MRI functional connectivity across 400 regions of interest covering the entire neocortex. Using the same atlas, we also assessed within each group the covariance of tau-PET levels among the 400 regions of interest. We found that higher resting-state functional MRI assessed functional connectivity between any given region of interest pair was associated with higher covariance in tau-PET binding in corresponding regions of interest. This result was consistently found in normal ageing, Alzheimer's disease and vascular cognitive impairment. In particular, inferior temporal tau-hotspots, as defined by highest tau-PET uptake, showed high predictive value of tau-PET levels in functionally closely connected regions of interest. These associations between functional connectivity and tau-PET uptake were detected regardless of presence of dementia symptoms (mild cognitive impairment or dementia), amyloid deposition (as assessed by amyloid-PET) or small vessel disease. Our findings suggest that higher functional connectivity between brain regions is associated with shared tau-levels, supporting the view of prion-like tau spreading facilitated by neural activity.",

    "title": "Selective loss of cortical endothelial tight junction proteins during Alzheimer's disease progression.",
    "abstract": "While the accumulation and aggregation of amyloid-beta and tau are central events in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, there is increasing evidence that cerebrovascular pathology is also abundant in Alzheimer's disease brains. In brain capillaries, endothelial cells are connected closely with one another through transmembrane tight junction proteins forming the blood-brain barrier. Because the blood-brain barrier tightly regulates the exchange of molecules between brain and blood and maintains brain homeostasis, its impairment is increasingly recognized as a critical factor contributing to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. However, the pathological relationship between blood-brain barrier properties and Alzheimer's disease progression in the human brain is not fully understood. In this study, we show that the loss of cortical tight junction proteins is a common event in Alzheimer's disease, and is correlated with synaptic degeneration. By quantifying the amounts of major tight junction proteins, claudin-5 and occludin, in 12 brain regions dissected from post-mortem brains of normal ageing (n = 10), pathological ageing (n = 14) and Alzheimer's disease patients (n = 19), we found that they were selectively decreased in cortical areas in Alzheimer's disease. Cortical tight junction proteins were decreased in association with the Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage. There was also a negative correlation between the amount of tight junction proteins and the amounts of insoluble Alzheimer's disease-related proteins, in particular amyloid-beta40, in cortical areas. In addition, the amount of tight junction proteins in these areas correlated positively with those of synaptic markers. Thus, loss of cortical tight junction proteins in Alzheimer's disease is associated with insoluble amyloid-beta40 and loss of synaptic markers. Importantly, the positive correlation between claudin-5 and synaptic markers, in particular synaptophysin, was present independent of insoluble amyloid-beta40, amyloid-beta42 and tau values, suggesting that loss of cortical tight junction proteins and synaptic degeneration is present, at least in part, independent of insoluble Alzheimer's disease-related proteins. Collectively, these results indicate that loss of tight junction proteins occurs predominantly in the neocortex during Alzheimer's disease progression. Further, our findings provide a neuropathological clue as to how endothelial tight junction pathology may contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis in both synergistic and additive manners to typical amyloid-beta and tau pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) accumulation in the brain, which is influenced by several factors, is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the important role of histidine in stabilizing the fibrillar structure of the Abeta peptide at neutral pH, the effect of histidine tautomerism on Abeta peptide aggregation is still largely unknown. Histidine is in equilibrium between delta and epsilon tautomers and there are three histidine residues (H6, H13, and H14) in the Abeta(1-40) peptide. We performed molecular dynamics simulation on (deltadeltadelta) and (epsilonepsilonepsilon) histidine tautomers with different initial homodimeric configurations to elucidate structural and aggregation features. Results indicate that (epsilonepsilonepsilon) homodimers have very low propensity or almost no tendency to form beta-sheets, whereas (deltadeltadelta) dimers predominantly form beta-sheets due to interactions between central hydrophobic core (CHC) residues and C-terminal residues. beta-sheet formation occurred in the same regions of each dimer chain at the CHC and C-/N- terminals for different configurations of (deltadeltadelta). These results suggest that (deltadeltadelta) has an important role in AD progression. Our study provides deeper insight into the effect of tautomerism of histidine residues in Abeta(1-40) on amyloid aggregation.",

Nontargeted proteomic analysis that incorporated peptide fractionation and high-resolution mass spectrometry quantified relative protein abundances in plasma samples from all participants. A protein classifier model was trained to predict Abeta-positive participants using feature selection and machine learning in AIBL and independently assessed in KARVIAH. A 12-feature model for predicting Abeta-positive participants was established and demonstrated high accuracy (testing area under the receiver operator characteristic curve = 0.891, sensitivity = 0.78, and specificity = 0.77).

    "abstract": "We previously demonstrated that microglia play an essential role in clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology. Our prior work also showed that several receptors expressed on microglia participated in Abeta phagocytosis. However, clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), which is associated with production and release of Abeta in neurons, has received much less attention in the context of microglial Abeta uptake. To elucidate the detailed mechanisms of microglial Abeta uptake pathways, we focused on CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which have been shown to mediate fibrillar Abeta1 - 42 (fAbeta42) phagocytosis in microglia. CD14 has also been known to control lipopolysaccharide-induced internalization of TLR4 in a clathrin-dependent manner. However, it remains unclear whether CD14 and TLR4 engage in CME in microglial fAbeta42 uptake, including whether CD14 interacts with TLR4 in the process. In the present study, we found that CD14-positive microglia increased in an age-dependent manner in the cortex of AD model mice. Immunostaining showed that CD14 interacted with TLR4 to internalize fAbeta42 in the mouse microglial cell line MG6. Knock-down of CD14 and TLR4 in MG6 cells significantly reduced intracellular fAbeta42, showing their involvement in fAbeta42 uptake. We also found that clathrin participated in fAbeta42 uptake by MG6 cells. Furthermore, CD14 and TLR4 mediated fAbeta42 uptake via clathrin-dependent mechanisms. These results indicate that CD14 and TLR4 participate not only in phagocytosis but also in clathrin-dependent fAbeta42 internalization in microglia. These findings provide novel molecular understanding of microglial fAbeta42 uptake, which could be of therapeutic relevance for AD.",

    "abstract": "The 2018 NIA-AA research framework proposes a classification system with Amyloid-beta deposition, pathologic Tau, and Neurodegeneration (ATN) for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database can be utilized to identify diagnostic signatures for predicting AD progression, and to determine the utility of this NIA-AA research framework. Profiles of 320 peptides from baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of 287 normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD subjects followed over a 3-10-year period were measured via multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. CSF Abeta42, total-Tau (tTau), phosphorylated-Tau (pTau-181), and hippocampal volume were also measured. From these candidate markers, optimal signatures with decision thresholds to separate AD and normal subjects were first identified via unbiased regression and tree-based algorithms. The best performing signature determined via cross-validation was then tested in an independent group of MCI subjects to predict future progression. This multivariate analysis yielded a simple diagnostic signature comprising CSF pTau-181 to Abeta42 ratio, MRI hippocampal volume, and low CSF levels of a novel PTPRN peptide, with a decision threshold on each marker. When applied to a separate MCI group at baseline, subjects meeting these signature criteria experience 4.3-fold faster progression to AD compared to a 2.2-fold faster progression using only conventional markers. This novel 4-marker signature represents an advance over the current diagnostics based on widely used markers, and is easier to use in practice than recently published complex signatures. This signature also reinforces the ATN construct from the 2018 NIA-AA research framework.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimages of cerebral amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation and small vessel disease (SVD) were examined in patients with various types of cognitive disorders using 11C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio (mcSUVR) was applied for a quantitative analysis of PiB-PET data. The severity of white matter lesions (WML) and enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS) on MRI were assessed to evaluate complicating cerebral SVD using semiquantitative scales. In homozygous apolipoprotein E e3/e3 carriers, the incidence of more severe WML and EPVS was higher in PiB-positive than PiB-negative patients, indicating that WML and EPVS might be associated with enhanced Abeta accumulation. An association study between PiB-PET and MRI findings revealed that higher WML grades significantly correlate with lower mcSUVRs, especially in the frontal area, indicating that more severe ischemic MRI findings are associated with milder Abeta accumulation among patients with Alzheimer's disease. In these patients SVD may accelerate the occurrence of cognitive decline and facilitate early recognition of dementia.",

    "title": "Vascular Burden Score Impacts Cognition Independent of Amyloid PET and MRI Measures of Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Brain Injury.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of vascular burden on rates of decline in episodic memory and executive function. We hypothesize that greater vascular burden will have an additive negative impact on cognition after accounting for baseline cognitive impairment, positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid burden, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures. METHODS: Individuals were followed an average of 5 years with serial cognitive assessments. Predictor variables include vascular burden score (VBS), quantitative brain MRI assessment, and amyloid imaging. Subjects consisted of 65 individuals, 53% of whom were male, aged 73.2+-7.2 years on average with an average of 15.5+-3.3 years of educational achievement. RESULTS: Baseline cognitive impairment was significantly associated poorer episodic memory (p < 0.0001), smaller hippocampal volume (p < 0.0001), smaller brain volume (p = 0.0026), and greater global Pittsburg Imaging Compound B (PiB) index (p = 0.0008). Greater amyloid burden was associated with greater decline in episodic memory over time (beta= -0.20+-0.07, p < 0.005). VBS was significantly associated with the level of executive function performance (beta= -0.14+-0.05, p < 0.005) and there was a significant negative interaction between VBS, cognitive impairment, and PiB index (beta= -0.065+-0.03, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our results find a significant influence of VBS independent of standard MRI measures and cerebral amyloid burden on executive function. In addition, VBS reduced the amount of cerebral amyloid burden needed to result in cognitive impairment. We conclude that the systemic effects of vascular disease as reflected by the VBS independently influence cognitive ability.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism emerged as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little was known about its effects on the process of potential AD. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of the Val66Met polymorphism on cognition, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and neuroimaging markers in non-demented elderly individuals. METHODS: A total of 1,081 adults without dementia (375 healthy subjects and 706 individuals with mild cognitive impairment) were recruited from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to test the influence of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on cognitive impairment, brain structure atrophy, and change in the levels of CSF biomarkers. Moreover, we also conducted our study in abnormal amyloid-beta (A+) subgroup and normal amyloid-beta (A-) subgroup, as well as in APOEe4 carriers and non-carriers. RESULTS: The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism had significant association with atrophy of the entorhinal cortex and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in the non-demented elderly and A + subgroup, while no association was found in A-subgroup. What is more, there was a significant effect of interaction between BDNF Val66Met and amyloid-beta load in MMSE. In addition, significant associations of BDNF Val66Met with the entorhinal cortex and ventricular volumes were found among APOEe4 non-carriers, but not APOEe4 carriers. CONCLUSIONS: The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is associated with cognitive impairment and brain atrophy among the non-demented elderly, APOEe4 non-carriers and A + subgroup, implying the potential of the Val66Met polymorphism as an important genetic factor for AD-related neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Astrocytes produce and store the energy reserve glycogen. However, abnormal large glycogen units accumulate if the production or degradation of glycogen is disturbed, a finding often seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have shown increased activity of glycogen degrading alpha-amylase in AD patients and alpha-amylase positive glial cells adjacent to AD characteristic amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the role of alpha-amylase in astrocytic glycogenolysis in presence of Abeta. METHODS: Presence of alpha-amylase and large glycogen units in postmortem entorhinal cortex from AD patients and non-demented controls were analyzed by immunohistological stainings. Impact of different Abeta42 aggregation forms on enzymatic activity (alpha-amylase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase), lactate secretion, and accumulation of large glycogen units in cultured astrocytes were analyzed by activity assays, ELISA, and immunocytochemistry, respectively. RESULTS: AD patients showed increased number of alpha-amylase positive glial cells. The glial cells co-expressed the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein, displayed hypertrophic features, and increased amount of large glycogen units. We further found increased load of large glycogen units, alpha-amylase immunoreactivity and alpha-amylase activity in cultured astrocytes stimulated with fibril Abeta42, with increased pyruvate kinase activity, but unaltered lactate release as downstream events. The fibril Abeta42-induced alpha-amylase activity was attenuated by beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol. DISCUSSION: We hypothesize that astrocytes respond to fibril Abeta42 in Abeta plaques by increasing their alpha-amylase production to either liberate energy or regulate functions needed in reactive processes. These findings indicate alpha-amylase as an important actor involved in AD associated neuroinflammation.",

    "title": "Small Molecule Amyloid-beta Protein Precursor Processing Modulators Lower Amyloid-beta Peptide Levels via cKit Signaling.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides consisting of 39-43 amino acids, proteolytically derived fragments of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP), and the accumulation of the hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau. Inhibiting Abeta production may reduce neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction associated with AD. We have previously used an AbetaPP-firefly luciferase enzyme complementation assay to conduct a high throughput screen of a compound library for inhibitors of AbetaPP dimerization, and identified a compound that reduces Abeta levels. In the present study, we have identified an analog, compound Y10, which also reduced Abeta. Initial kinase profiling assays identified the receptor tyrosine kinase cKit as a putative Y10 target. To elucidate the precise mechanism involved, AbetaPP phosphorylation was examined by IP-western blotting. We found that Y10 inhibits cKit phosphorylation and increases AbetaPP phosphorylation mainly on tyrosine residue Y743, according to AbetaPP751 numbering. A known cKit inhibitor and siRNA specific to cKit were also found to increase AbetaPP phosphorylation and lower Abeta levels. We also investigated a cKit downstream signaling molecule, the Shp2 phosphatase, and found that known Shp2 inhibitors and siRNA specific to Shp2 also increase AbetaPP phosphorylation, suggesting that the cKit signaling pathway is also involved in AbetaPP phosphorylation and Abeta production. We further found that inhibitors of both cKit and Shp2 enhance AbetaPP surface localization. Thus, regulation of AbetaPP phosphorylation by small molecules should be considered as a novel therapeutic intervention for AD.",

We investigated the association between post-mortem iron levels with the clinical and pathological diagnosis of AD, its severity, and the rate of cognitive decline in the 12 years prior to death in subjects from the Memory and Aging Project (n = 209). Iron was elevated (beta [SE] = 9.7 [2.6]; P = 3.0 x 10-4) in the inferior temporal cortex only in subjects who were diagnosed with clinical AD during life and had a diagnosis of AD confirmed post-mortem by standardized criteria. Although iron was weakly associated with the extent of proteinopathy in tissue with AD neuropathology, it was strongly associated with the rate of cognitive decline (e.g., global cognition: beta [SE] = -0.040 [0.005], P = 1.6 x 10-14). Thus, cortical iron might act to propel cognitive deterioration upon the underlying proteinopathy of AD, possibly by inducing oxidative stress or ferroptotic cell death, or may be related to an inflammatory response.",

    "abstract": "The most prevalent neurodegenerative disease is Alzheimer's dementia. It is determined by the deposits of amyloid-beta peptide which leads to memory impairment, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration. Aromatherapy by using essential oils could represent a natural treatment option for Alzheimer's dementia. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the neuroprotective and nootropic effects of Pinus halepensis essential oil (PNO, 1% and 3%, administered for three weeks) in a rat model of acute amyloid beta (1-42) (Abeta1-42) toxicity. Rats were behaviorally tested (radial arm maze and Y-maze activities being used). Rats were divided into five groups (n = 5 / group): first group - vehicle, second group - Abeta1-42, the third and fourth group - PNO treatment groups (1% and 3%), and fifth group - donepezil group (as positive control, 5 mg/kg injected in Abeta1-42-treated rats). Antioxidant activity of the investigated essential oil was assessed using radical scavenging assays, such as 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) tests. Also, biochemical estimations of the brain homogenates for acetylcholinesterase and oxidative stress biomarkers were carried out. The essential oil reversed the amyloid beta (1-42)-induced decreasing of the spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze test and the amyloid beta (1-42)-induced increasing of the working and reference memory errors in the radial arm maze test. The amyloid beta (1-42)-induced modification of the balance oxidant-antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase action in the hippocampus of the rat has been ameliorated using the essential oil. These findings suggested that Pinus halepensis essential oil has nootropic and neuroprotective activities and may be regarded as a therapeutic tool for attenuation of Abeta toxicity and neuronal dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Based on associations between sleep spindles, cognition, and sleep-dependent memory processing, here we evaluated potential relationships between levels of CSF Abeta42, P-tau, and T-tau with sleep spindle density and other biophysical properties of sleep spindles in a sample of cognitively normal elderly individuals. METHODS: One-night in-lab nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) and morning to early afternoon CSF collection were performed to measure CSF Abeta42, P-tau and T-tau. Seven days of actigraphy were collected to assess habitual total sleep time. RESULTS: Spindle density during NREM stage 2 (N2) sleep was negatively correlated with CSF Abeta42, P-tau and T-tau. From the three, CSF T-tau was the most significantly associated with spindle density, after adjusting for age, sex and ApoE4. Spindle duration, count and fast spindle density were also negatively correlated with T-tau levels. Sleep duration and other measures of sleep quality were not correlated with spindle characteristics and did not modify the associations between sleep spindle characteristics and the CSF biomarkers of AD. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced spindles during N2 sleep may represent an early dysfunction related to tau, possibly reflecting axonal damage or altered neuronal tau secretion, rendering it a potentially novel biomarker for early neuronal dysfunction. Given their putative role in memory consolidation and neuroplasticity, sleep spindles may represent a mechanism by which tau impairs memory consolidation, as well as a possible target for therapeutic interventions in cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Ginsenoside compound K (CK) is the main metabolite of protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides and has been demonstrated to exert neuroprotective and cognition-enhancing effects. The effects of CK on cognitive function in vascular dementia (VD) has not been elucidated. Therefore, the present study aims to elucidate the effects of CK on memory function as well as its potential mechanism in VD rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion (CCH) by permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO). CCH induced neuronal damage and aggravated the aggregation of Amyloid-beta1-42 peptides (Abeta1-42), which plays a critical role in the neurotoxicity and cognitive impairment. CK treatment attenuated CCH-induced Abeta1-42 deposition and ameliorated cognition impairment. Furthermore, CK enhanced the activity of the pSer9-Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (pSer9-GSK3beta) and the insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), which mainly involved the production and clearance of Abeta1-42. Moreover, CK treatment enhanced the activity of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), a key kinase in phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway that can regulate the activity of GSK-3beta and IDE. In short, our findings provide the first evidence that CK might attenuate cognitive deficits and Abeta1-42 deposition in the hippocampus via enhancing the expression of pSer9-GSK-3beta and IDE.",

    "abstract": "Biological sex exerts distinct influences on brain levels of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in both clinical depression and Alzheimer disease (AD), yet studies in animal models focus primarily on males. We examined behavioral 'despair'/depression (using the tail-suspension test) and memory (using the novel object recognition task) in J20 (hAPPSwe/Ind) mice. Three month-old male (but not female) J20 mice exhibited less despair-like behavior, but more evidence of cognitive deficits. In young J20 mice, only soluble Abeta peptides -primarily Abeta(1-40)- were detected. There was no evidence of an effect on despair-like behavior in the six month-old J20 mice, although cognitive deficits were now evident in both sexes, and coincided with a greater proportion of the neurotoxic Abeta(1-42) species (in soluble as well as insoluble fractions). This age-dependent shift in Abeta peptide profile coincided with reduced expression of glycosylated species of ADAM-10 (alpha-secretase) and BACE1 (beta-secretase), and an increased co-immunoprecipitation of presenilin-1 with nicastrin (components of the gamma-secretase complex). Sex-dependent changes in depression-related monoaminergic, e.g. serotonin and dopamine (but not noradrenaline), systems were evident already in young J20 mice. It is critical to acknowledge that sex-dependent APP-related phenotypes might differentially influence modifiable depression-related monoaminergic signalling at some of the earliest pathological stages of clinical AD.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain is believed to play a central role in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Revisions to the amyloid cascade hypothesis now acknowledge the dynamic equilibrium in which Abeta exists and the importance of enzymes involved in the production and breakdown of Abeta in maintaining healthy Abeta levels. However, while a wealth of pharmacological and immunological therapies are being generated to inhibit the Abeta-producing enzymes, beta-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 and gamma-secretase, the therapeutic potential of stimulating Abeta-degrading enzymes such as neprilysin, endothelin-converting enzyme-1 and insulin-degrading enzyme remains relatively unexplored. Recent evidence indicates that increasing Abeta degradation as opposed to inhibiting synthesis is a more effective strategy to prevent Abeta build-up. Therefore Abeta degrading enzymes have become valuable targets of therapy. In this review, we discuss the pathway of Abeta synthesis and clearance along with the opportunities they present for therapeutic intervention, the benefits of increasing the expression/activity of Abeta-degrading enzymes, and the untapped therapeutic potential of enzyme activation.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a type of vascular disease present in more than 50% of demented elderly and more than 80% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Both CAA and AD are characterized by extracellular Abeta deposits with the distinction that CAA has vascular deposits while AD has amyloid plaques. In this study, we used immunoprecipitation (IP) in combination with mass spectrometry (MS) to test the hypothesis that the Abeta peptide pattern differs between subjects having Abeta plaque pathology only and subjects with Abeta plaque pathology together with CAA pathology. Occipital lobes from 12 AD brains, ranging from no CAA to severe CAA, were extracted using 70% formic acid followed by IP-MS analysis. The Abeta peptide pattern differed greatly between subjects with no CAA compared to subjects with CAA. In cases with CAA, the most abundant Abeta peptides ended at amino acid 40 including Abeta1-40 (P = .048) and Abeta 2-40 (P = .0253) which were significantly increased compared to cases with no CAA. This was in contrast to subjects with no CAA where the most abundant Abeta peptides ended at amino acid 42 of which Abeta1-42 (P = .0101) and Abeta2-42 (P = .0051) as well as the pyroglutamate (pGlu)-modified peptides pGlu Abeta3-42 (P = .0177), and pGlu Abeta11-42 (P = .0088) were significantly increased compared to CAA subjects. The results are in line with earlier immunohistochemistry data and show that the molecular composition of the Abeta deposits found in blood vessels are different to the parenchymal deposits, suggesting they arise from distinct pathogenic pathways. This information may be useful in the development of pathology-specific biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have shown that atherosclerotic risk factors accelerate the pathological process underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) via chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. In this study, we aimed to clarify the mechanisms by which cerebral hypoperfusion may exacerbate AD pathology. We applied bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) to a mice model of AD and evaluated how the equilibrium of amyloid beta oligomers respond to hypoperfusion. BCAS accelerated amyloid beta (Abeta) convergence to the aggregation seed, facilitating the growth of Abeta plaques, but without changing the total Abeta amount in the brain. Furthermore, Abeta oligomers with high molecular weight increased in the brain of BCAS-operated mice. Considering Abeta is in an equilibrium among monomeric, oligomeric, and aggregation forms, our data suggest that cerebral hypoperfusion after BCAS shifted this equilibrium to a state where a greater number of Abeta molecules participate in Abeta assemblies to form aggregation-prone Abeta oligomers with high molecular weight. The reduced blood flow in the cerebral arteries due to BCAS attenuated the dynamics of the interstitial fluid leading to congestion, which may have facilitated Abeta aggregation. We suggest that cerebral hypoperfusion may accelerate AD by enhancing the tendency of Abeta to become aggregation-prone.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) proteins through their self-assembly into oligomers, fibrils, or senile plaques is advocated as a key process of Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have revealed that metal ions play an essential role in modulating the aggregation rate of amyloid-beta (Abeta) into senile plaques because of high binding affinity between Abeta proteins and metal ions. In this paper, we proposed a mathematical model as a set of coupled kinetic equations that models the self-assembly of amyloid-beta (Abeta) proteins in the presence of metal ions. The numerical simulations capture four timescales in the Abeta dynamics associated with three important events which include the formation of the amyloid-metal complex, the homogeneous aggregation of the amyloid-metal complexes, and the non-homogeneous aggregation of the amyloid-metal complexes. The method of singular perturbation is used to identify these timescales in the framework of slow-fast systems.",

    "abstract": "Structural characterization of amyloid (A)beta peptides implicated in Alzheimer's disease is a challenging problem due to their intrinsically disordered nature and their high propensity for aggregation. Only limited information is currently available from experiments on conformational properties and aggregation pathways of the peptides in cellular environments. In silico modeling complements experimental information, providing atomistic insight into structure and dynamics of different Abeta species. All-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a properly selected force field can deliver reliable structural and dynamic information. In the case of intrinsically disordered Abeta peptides, enhanced sampling simulations beyond the nanosecond time scale are required to obtain statistically meaningful results even for simple solvent conditions. To overcome the challenges of conformational sampling in crowded cellular environments, alternative approaches have to be used, including postprocessing of MD data. In this study, we employ the statistical-mechanical, three-dimensional reference interaction site model with the Kovalenko-Hirata closure integral equation molecular theory of solvation to describe solvent composition effects on the conformational equilibrium in a structural ensemble of the Abeta42 (covering residues 1-42) monomer based on a statistical reweighting technique. The methodology enables a computationally efficient prediction on how different factors in the cellular environment, such as solvent composition, nonpolar solvation, and macromolecular crowding, affect the structural properties of the monomer. Similarities have been identified between changes in the structural ensemble caused by nonpolar solvation and crowded environments modeled by ionic solution with large negative ions. In particular, both solvent conditions reduce the random coil content and enhance the helical structure content of the monomer. In contrast to the previous studies, which reported increased alpha-helical content of peptides in crowded environments, this work attributes these structural features to the difference in solvent exposure of hydrophilic residues of the monomer for different secondary structure elements, rather than to (entropic) excluded volume effects.",

Case reports and literature review were performed. The implication for diagnostic approach of early-onset dementia with negative family history was developed. We reported two Chinese EOAD cases with de novo mutations. The genotype PSEN1 G206S appeared to correlate with the phenotype of EOAD with pure cognitive problems. The second case had a PSEN1 M233V mutation with an earlier age of onset of 25 with cognitive decline, parkinsonism, and epilepsy.

The deposition of beta-amyloid plaques is likely to start years in advance of manifestation of clinical symptoms, although the exact timing is unknown. Over the years, Abeta peptides undergo both post-translational modification and stereoisomerization. Analysis of the resulting stereoisomers is particularly challenging because of their identical elemental composition and similar physicochemical properties. Herein, we have utilized our recently developed structures for lossless ion manipulations ion mobility-mass spectrometry platform (SLIM IM-MS), in conjunction with serpentine ultralong path with extended routing (SUPER), to baseline resolve four distinct sets of Abeta17-28 tryptic peptide epimers on a rapid (~1 s) time scale. We discovered that sodium adduct ions, [M + H + Na]2+, allowed baseline SLIM SUPER IM resolution for all Abeta epimer sets assessed, while such baseline separations were unachievable for their [M + 2H]2+ doubly protonated ions.",

These species are immunoreactive to the monoclonal antibody 6E10, which is directed against amino acids 6-10 of amyloid-beta (Abeta), and their levels correlate with levels of total tau and tau phosphorylated at Thr181. In this study, we investigated the molecular composition of these AD-related proteins using immunoprecipitation (IP)/Western blotting coupled with IP/mass spectrometry. We show that canonical Abeta1-40/42 peptides, together with amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) fragments located N-terminally of Abeta, are present in the ~55-kDa, 6E10-immunoreactive species. We demonstrate that APP fragments located N-terminally of Abeta, plus the N-terminal region of Abeta, are present in the ~15-kDa, 6E10-immunoreactive species. These findings add to the catalog of AD-related Abeta/APP species found in CSF and should motivate further study to determine whether these species may serve as biomarkers of disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the most prevalent dementia, is partially driven by genetics. To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and Abeta processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P = 1.32 x 10-7), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified. We also identify important genetic correlations between LOAD and traits such as family history of dementia and education.",

We found that Abeta shedding was enhanced under acidic pH conditions and in lipid compositions resembling raft microdomains, which are directly related to the microenvironment of Abeta generation. Furthermore, Abeta shedding efficiency was determined by the length of the C-terminal membrane-spanning region, whereas pH responsiveness appears to depend on the N-terminal ectodomain.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of reducing ADAMTS-3 on deposition of Abeta by crossbreeding drug-inducible ADAMTS-3 conditional knock-out (cKO) mice with \"next-generation\" AD model mice. We found that reducing ADAMTS-3 inhibited deposition of Abeta significantly in AppNL-F mice, which produce human wild-type Abeta. On the other hand, reducing ADAMTS-3 had no effect in AppNL-G-F mice, which produce the Arctic mutant Abeta (E22G) that forms protofibrils more efficiently than does wild-type Abeta. Thus, the findings suggest that the administration of an inhibitor against ADAMTS-3 will prevent the progression of AD pathology caused by deposition of wild-type Abeta.",

    "title": "Assessment of Plasma Total Tau Level as a Predictive Biomarker for Dementia and Related Endophenotypes.",
    "abstract": "Importance: Blood-based biomarkers have the potential to improve the identification of persons with the greatest dementia risk for inclusion in dementia prevention trials through low-cost and minimally invasive screening. Objective: To investigate the use of plasma total tau as a blood biomarker for dementia and related endophenotypes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study used data from the US community-based Framingham Heart Study with replication in the Memento study, a multicenter cohort of persons with mild cognitive impairment or subjective cognitive complaints recruited from memory clinics across France. Total tau levels were measured from stored plasma samples in Framingham Heart Study participants during 2004 to 2011. Dementia follow-up occurred across a median of 6 years (interquartile range, 5-8 years) for persons 65 years and older who were dementia free at baseline. Plasma and/or cerebrospinal fluid samples were obtained from Memento study participants from April 19, 2011, to June 22, 2016. Dementia follow-up took place over a median of 4 years (interquartile range, 3-5 years). Data analysis was performed from January to November 2018. Exposures: Plasma total tau level measured using single-molecule array technology. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incidence of dementia of any cause (all dementia) and dementia due to clinical Alzheimer disease (AD dementia). Results: Among the 1453 participants in the Framingham dementia study sample, the mean (SD) age was 75 (7) years; 792 (54.5%) were female. Among the 367 individuals in the replication cohort, the mean (SD) age was 69 (9) years; 217 (59.1%) were female. Of 134 cases of incident all dementia in the Framingham sample, 105 were AD dementia. After adjustment for age and sex, each SD unit increase in the log of plasma total tau level was associated with a 35% increase in AD dementia risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.35; 95% CI, 1.10-1.67). The addition of plasma total tau to a model including age and sex improved the stratification of participants for risk of AD dementia (net reclassification improvement, 0.382; 95% CI, 0.030-0.716). Higher plasma total tau level was associated with poorer cognition across 7 cognitive tasks (P < .05) and smaller hippocampi (hippocampal volume: beta [SE] = 0.002 [0.001]; P = .003) as well as neurofibrillary tangles (beta [SE] = 0.95 [0.45]; P = .04) and microinfarcts (odds ratio, 3.04; 95% CI, 1.26-7.37) at autopsy. In the replication cohort, plasma total tau level weakly correlated with cerebrospinal fluid total tau level (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.16; P = .07), but plasma total tau was at least as strongly associated with incident AD dementia as cerebrospinal fluid total tau (log plasma total tau: HR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.00-5.48; log cerebrospinal fluid total tau: HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.33-3.44) after adjustment for age and sex. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that plasma total tau levels may improve the prediction of future dementia, are associated with dementia endophenotypes, and may be used as a biomarker for risk stratification in dementia prevention trials.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the long-term cognitive trajectories of individuals with normal cognition at baseline and distinct amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (ATN) profiles. METHODS: Pooling data across 4 cohort studies, 814 cognitively normal participants (mean baseline age = 59.6 years) were classified into 8 ATN groups using baseline CSF levels of beta-amyloid 1-42 as a measure of amyloid (A), phosphorylated tau 181 as a measure of tau (T), and total tau as a measure of neurodegeneration (N). Cognitive performance was measured using a previously validated global factor score and with the Mini-Mental State Examination. We compared the cognitive trajectories across groups using growth curve models (mean follow-up time = 7 years). RESULTS: Using different model formulations and cut points for determining biomarker abnormality, only the group with abnormal levels of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration (A+T+N+) showed consistently greater cognitive decline than the group with normal levels of all biomarkers (A-T-N-). Replicating prior findings using the 2011 National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association/suspected non-Alzheimer disease pathophysiology schema, only individuals with abnormal levels of both amyloid and phosphorylated tau 181 or total tau (stage 2) showed greater cognitive decline than those with normal biomarker levels (stage 0). CONCLUSION: The results are consistent with the hypothesis that both elevated brain amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles are necessary to observe accelerated neurodegeneration, which in turn leads to cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Overexpression of recombinant proteins in bacteria may lead to their aggregation and deposition in inclusion bodies. Since the conformational properties of proteins in inclusion bodies exhibit many of the characteristics typical of amyloid fibrils. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the rate at which proteins form amyloid fibrils may be predicted from their propensity to form inclusion bodies. To establish a method based on this concept, we first measured by SDS-PAGE and confocal microscopy the level of inclusion bodies in E. coli cells overexpressing the 40-residue amyloid-beta peptide, Abeta40, wild-type and 24 charge mutants. We then compared these results with a number of existing computational aggregation propensity predictors as well as the rates of aggregation measured in vitro for selected mutants. Our results show a strong correlation between the level of inclusion body formation and aggregation propensity, thus demonstrating the power of this approach and its value in identifying factors modulating aggregation kinetics.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifaceted disease that is characterized by increased oxidative stress, metal-ion dysregulation, and the formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates. In this work we report the large affinity binding of the iron(iii) 2,17-bis-sulfonato-5,10,15-tris(pentafluorophenyl)corrole complex FeL1 to the Abeta peptide (K d ~ 10-7) and the ability of the bound FeL1 to act as a catalytic antioxidant in both the presence and absence of Cu(ii) ions. Specific findings are that: (a) an Abeta histidine residue binds axially to FeL1; (b) that the resulting adduct is an efficient catalase; (c) this interaction restricts the formation of high molecular weight peptide aggregates. UV-Vis and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies show that although the binding of FeL1 does not influence the Abeta-Cu(ii) interaction (K d ~ 10-10), bound FeL1 still acts as an antioxidant thereby significantly limiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation from Abeta-Cu. Overall, FeL1 is shown to bind to the Abeta peptide, and modulate peptide aggregation. In addition, FeL1 forms a ternary species with Abeta-Cu(ii) and impedes ROS generation, thus showing the promise of discrete metal complexes to limit the toxicity pathways of the Abeta peptide.",

Ferrocene is an optically and electrochemically active signal which was successfully encapsulated inside of the ZIF-8 and released by the competitive coordination between Zn ions and AbetaO after being treated with AbetaO. The released ferrocene content was monitored by ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometry and cyclic voltammetry.

METHODS: CSF neurogranin, SNAP-25, VILIP-1, and YKL-40 were measured in families carrying autosomal-dominant AD mutations. RESULTS: The four emerging CSF biomarkers were significantly elevated in the mutation carriers (n = 235) versus noncarriers (n = 145). CSF SNAP-25, VILIP-1, and YKL-40 were altered very early in the AD time course, approximately 15-19 years before estimated symptom onset. All CSF biomarkers predicted important AD-related outcomes including performance on a cognitive composite, brain amyloid burden as measured by amyloid positron emission tomography, and the estimated years from symptom onset. DISCUSSION: Early abnormalities in CSF tTau, pTau, SNAP-25, VILIP-1, and YKL-40 suggest that synaptic damage, neuronal injury, and neuroinflammation begin shortly after the commencement of brain amyloid accumulation.",

It arises from the formation of amyloid fibrils from the acute phase protein serum amyloid A. Here, we report the purification and electron cryo-microscopy analysis of amyloid fibrils from a mouse and a human patient with systemic AA amyloidosis. The obtained resolutions are 3.0 A and 2.7 A for the murine and human fibril, respectively. The two fibrils differ in fundamental properties, such as presence of right-hand or left-hand twisted cross-beta sheets and overall fold of the fibril proteins. Yet, both proteins adopt highly similar beta-arch conformations within the N-terminal ~21 residues. Our data demonstrate the importance of the fibril protein N-terminus for the stability of the analyzed amyloid fibril morphologies and suggest strategies of combating this disease by interfering with specific fibril polymorphs.",

    "abstract": "Despite intense interests in developing blood measurements of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the progress has been confounded by limited sensitivity and poor correlation to brain pathology. Here, we present a dedicated analytical platform for measuring different populations of circulating amyloid beta (Abeta) proteins - exosome-bound vs. unbound - directly from blood. The technology, termed amplified plasmonic exosome (APEX), leverages in situ enzymatic conversion of localized optical deposits and double-layered plasmonic nanostructures to enable sensitive, multiplexed population analysis. It demonstrates superior sensitivity (~200 exosomes), and enables diverse target co-localization in exosomes. Employing the platform, we find that prefibrillar Abeta aggregates preferentially bind with exosomes. We thus define a population of Abeta as exosome-bound (Abeta42+ CD63+) and measure its abundance directly from AD and control blood samples. As compared to the unbound or total circulating Abeta, the exosome-bound Abeta measurement could better reflect PET imaging of brain amyloid plaques and differentiate various clinical groups.",

In healthy brain, Abeta can associate with Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) which is involved in its metabolism and clearance. In the brain of patients with AD, ApoE is cleaved and produces ApoE fragments. We studied the forms of Abeta and their interaction with the ApoE fragments in post-mortem brains from control and AD patients by western blots and co-immunoprecipitation. Three Abeta-containing peptides and three ApoE fragments were specifically found in the brain of AD patients. Co-immunoprecipitations showed that ApoE fragments and Abeta1-42 peptides are co-partners in heteromers of 18 and 16 kDa while ApoE-fragments and Abeta peptides of 12 kDa did not interact with each other. Formation of the 18 kDa ApoE-fragment/Abeta heteromers is specifically increased in ApoE4 carriers and is a strong brain marker of AD while 16 kDa ApoE-fragment/Abeta and Abeta 12 kDa correlate to memory deficit. These data show that in patients with AD, ApoE fragmentation generates peptides that trap Abeta in the brain. Inhibiting the fragmentation or targeting ApoE fragments could be exploited to define strategies to detect or reverse AD.",

    "abstract": "Research into cognitive resilience imaging markers may help determine the clinical significance of Alzheimer's disease pathology among older adults over 80 years (80+). In this study, we aimed to identify a fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET based imaging marker of cognitive resilience. We identified 457 participants >= 80 years old (357 cognitively unimpaired, 118 cognitively impaired at baseline, mean age of 83.5 +- 3.2 years) from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) with baseline MRI, Pittsburgh compound B-PET and FDG-PET scans and neuropsychological evaluation. We identified a subset of 'resilient' participants (cognitively stable 80+, n = 192) who maintained normal cognition for an average of 5 years (2-10 years). Global PIB ratio, FDG-PET ratio and cortical thickness from Alzheimer's disease signature regions were used as Alzheimer's disease imaging biomarker outcomes and global cognitive z-score was used as a cognitive outcome. First, using voxel-wise multiple regression analysis, we identified the metabolic areas underlying cognitive resilience in cognitively stable 80+ participants, which we call the 'resilience signature'. Second, using multivariate linear regression models, we evaluated the association of risk and protective factors with the resilience signature and its added value for predicting global cognition beyond established Alzheimer's disease imaging biomarkers in the full 80+ sample. Third, we evaluated the utility of the resilience signature in conjunction with amyloidosis in predicting longitudinal cognition using linear mixed effect models. Lastly, we assessed the utility of the resilience signature in an independent cohort using ADNI (n = 358, baseline mean age of 80 +- 3.8). Our main findings were: (i) FDG-PET uptake in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and anterior temporal pole was associated with baseline global cognition in cognitively stable 80+ (the resilience signature); (ii) established Alzheimer's disease imaging biomarkers did not predict baseline global cognition in this subset of participants; (iii) in the full MCSA 80+ and ADNI cohorts, amyloid burden and FDG-PET in the resilience signature were the stronger predictors of baseline global cognition; (iv) sex and systemic vascular health predicted FDG-PET in the resilience signature, suggesting vascular health maintenance as a potential pathway to preserve the metabolism of these areas; and (v) the resilience signature provided significant information about global longitudinal cognitive change even when considering amyloid status in both the MCSA and ADNI cohorts. The FDG-PET resilience signature may be able to provide important information in conjunction with other Alzheimer's disease biomarkers for the determination of clinical prognosis. It may also facilitate identification of disease targeting modifiable risk factors such as vascular health maintenance.",

    "title": "Association of Midlife Diet With Subsequent Risk for Dementia.",
    "abstract": "Importance: Observational studies suggest that diet is linked to cognitive health. However, the duration of follow-up in many studies is not sufficient to take into account the long preclinical phase of dementia, and the evidence from interventional studies is not conclusive. Objective: To examine whether midlife diet is associated with subsequent risk for dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based cohort study established in 1985-1988 that had dietary intake assessed in 1991-1993, 1997-1999, and 2002-2004 and follow-up for incident dementia until March 31, 2017. Exposures: Food frequency questionnaire to derive the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), an 11-component diet quality score (score range, 0-110), with higher scores indicating a healthier diet. Main Outcome and Measures: Incident dementia ascertained through linkage to electronic health records. Results: Among 8225 participants without dementia in 1991-1993 (mean age, 50.2 years [SD, 6.1 years]; 5686 [69.1%] were men), a total of 344 cases of incident dementia were recorded during a median follow-up of 24.8 years (interquartile range, 24.2-25.1 years). No significant difference in the incidence rate for dementia was observed in tertiles of AHEI exposure during 1991-1993, 1997-1999 (median follow-up, 19.1 years), and 2002-2004 (median follow-up, 13.5 years). Compared with an incidence rate for dementia of 1.76 (95% CI, 1.47-2.12) per 1000 person-years in the worst tertile of AHEI (lowest tertile of diet quality) in 1991-1993, the absolute rate difference for the intermediate tertile was 0.03 (95% CI, -0.43 to 0.49) per 1000 person-years and for the best tertile was 0.04 (95% CI, -0.42 to 0.51) per 1000 person-years. Compared with the worst AHEI tertile in 1997-1999 (incidence rate for dementia, 2.06 [95% CI, 1.62 to 2.61] per 1000 person-years), the absolute rate difference for the intermediate AHEI tertile was 0.14 (95% CI, -0.58 to 0.86) per 1000 person-years and for the best AHEI tertile was 0.14 (95% CI, -0.58 to 0.85) per 1000 person-years. Compared with the worst AHEI tertile in 2002-2004 (incidence rate for dementia, 3.12 [95% CI, 2.49 to 3.92] per 1000 person-years), the absolute rate difference for the intermediate AHEI tertile was -0.61 (95% CI, -1.56 to 0.33) per 1000 person-years and for the best AHEI tertile was -0.73 (95% CI, -1.67 to 0.22) per 1000 person-years. In the multivariable analysis, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for dementia per 1-SD (10-point) AHEI increment were not significant as assessed in 1991-1993 (adjusted HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.08]), in 1997-1999 (adjusted HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.83 to 1.12]), or in 2002-2004 (adjusted HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.75 to 1.00]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this long-term prospective cohort study, diet quality assessed during midlife was not significantly associated with subsequent risk for dementia.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prion disease research and surveillance can be challenging due to the disease's difficulty to diagnose, rapid progression, and geographic dispersion. Improving accessibility through teleneurology could improve the ability to conduct these activities. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of conducting teleneurology assessments for research and surveillance of prion diseases. METHOD: Participants were offered in-person visit, medical record review, or teleneurology assessment. Standardized histories and assessments evaluating cognition, functional ability, and neuropsychiatric symptoms were collected. Data regarding participants' satisfaction with teleneurology were collected. RESULTS: From April 2017 to July 2018, the study received 114 referrals. 45 and 5 participants consented for the teleneurology and medical record review arms of the study, respectively. 29 subjects participated in at least one teleneurology visit. Participants expressed satisfaction with teleneurology and found it easy to participate. Some aspects of the examination were hindered or interrupted due to technological reasons. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the feasibility and preference of teleneurology as a modality in which subjects with prion disease can partake in clinical research. Technological aspects sometimes interfered with research assessments.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the formation of toxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers and plaques. Considering that Abeta misfolding and aggregation precedes the progressive development of cognitive impairment in AD, investigating a therapeutic means by clearance of pre-existing Abeta aggregates shows promise as a viable disease-modifying treatment. Here, we report that a small molecule, necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), reduces Abeta aggregates back to non-toxic monomers in vitro and in vivo. Intravenous administration of Nec-1 reduced the levels of Abeta plaques in the brains of aged APP/PS1 double transgenic mice. In addition, Nec-1 exhibited therapeutic effects against Abeta aggregates by inhibiting Abeta-induced brain cell death in neuronal and microglial cell lines. Nec-1 also showed anti-apoptotic and anti-necroptotic effects in the cortex of aged APP/PS1 mice by reducing levels of phosphorylated-RIPK3 and Bax and increasing the levels of Bcl-2. According to our data in vitro and in silico, the methyl group of the amine in the 2-thioxo-4-imidazolidinone is the key moiety of Nec-1 that directs its activity against aggregated Abeta. Given that the accumulation of Abeta aggregates is an important hallmark of AD, our studies provide strong evidence that Nec-1 may serve a key role in the development of AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the KLOTHO gene variant KL-VS attenuates APOE4-associated beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation in a late-middle-aged cohort enriched with Alzheimer disease (AD) risk factors. METHODS: Three hundred nine late-middle-aged adults from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention and the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center were genotyped to determine KL-VS and APOE4 status and underwent CSF sampling (n = 238) and/or 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET imaging (n = 183). Covariate-adjusted regression analyses were used to investigate whether APOE4 exerted expected effects on Abeta burden. Follow-up regression analyses stratified by KL-VS genotype (i.e., noncarrier vs heterozygous; there were no homozygous individuals) evaluated whether the influence of APOE4 on Abeta was different among KL-VS heterozygotes compared to noncarriers. RESULTS: APOE4 carriers exhibited greater Abeta burden than APOE4-negative participants. This effect was stronger in CSF (t = -5.12, p < 0.001) compared with PiB-PET (t = 3.93, p < 0.001). In the stratified analyses, this APOE4 effect on Abeta load was recapitulated among KL-VS noncarriers (CSF: t = -5.09, p < 0.001; PiB-PET: t = 3.77, p < 0 .001). In contrast, among KL-VS heterozygotes, APOE4-positive individuals did not exhibit higher Abeta burden than APOE4-negative individuals (CSF: t = -1.03, p = 0.308; PiB-PET: t = 0.92, p = 0.363). These differential APOE4 effects remained after KL-VS heterozygotes and noncarriers were matched on age and sex. CONCLUSION: In a cohort of at-risk late-middle-aged adults, KL-VS heterozygosity was associated with an abatement of APOE4-associated Abeta aggregation, suggesting KL-VS heterozygosity confers protections against APOE4-linked pathways to disease onset in AD.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomer-induced aberrant neurotransmitter release is proposed to be a crucial early event leading to synapse dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we report that the release probability (Pr) at the synapse between the Schaffer collateral (SC) and CA1 pyramidal neurons is significantly reduced at an early stage in mouse models of AD with elevated Abeta production. High nanomolar synthetic oligomeric Abeta42 also suppresses Pr at the SC-CA1 synapse in wild-type mice. This Abeta-induced suppression of Pr is mainly due to an mGluR5-mediated depletion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in axons. Selectively inhibiting Abeta-induced PIP2 hydrolysis in the CA3 region of the hippocampus strongly prevents oligomeric Abeta-induced suppression of Pr at the SC-CA1 synapse and rescues synaptic and spatial learning and memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice. These results first reveal the presynaptic mGluR5-PIP2 pathway whereby oligomeric Abeta induces early synaptic deficits in AD.",

    "title": "Proteolytic shedding of the prion protein via activation of metallopeptidase ADAM10 reduces cellular binding and toxicity of amyloid-beta oligomers.",
    "abstract": "The cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a key neuronal receptor for beta-amyloid oligomers (AbetaO), mediating their neurotoxicity, which contributes to the neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Similarly to the amyloid precursor protein (APP), PrPC is proteolytically cleaved from the cell surface by a disintegrin and metalloprotease, ADAM10. We hypothesized that ADAM10-modulated PrPC shedding would alter the cellular binding and cytotoxicity of AbetaO. Here, we found that in human neuroblastoma cells, activation of ADAM10 with the muscarinic agonist carbachol promotes PrPC shedding and reduces the binding of AbetaO to the cell surface, which could be blocked with an ADAM10 inhibitor. Conversely, siRNA-mediated ADAM10 knockdown reduced PrPC shedding and increased AbetaO binding, which was blocked by the PrPC-specific antibody 6D11. The retinoic acid receptor analog acitretin, which up-regulates ADAM10, also promoted PrPC shedding and decreased AbetaO binding in the neuroblastoma cells and in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical neurons. Pretreatment with acitretin abolished activation of Fyn kinase and prevented an increase in reactive oxygen species caused by AbetaO binding to PrPC Besides blocking AbetaO binding and toxicity, acitretin also increased the nonamyloidogenic processing of APP. However, in the iPSC-derived neurons, Abeta and other amyloidogenic processing products did not exhibit a reciprocal decrease upon acitretin treatment. These results indicate that by promoting the shedding of PrPC in human neurons, ADAM10 activation prevents the binding and cytotoxicity of AbetaO, revealing a potential therapeutic benefit of ADAM10 activation in AD.",

    "abstract": "Imatinib mesylate, 1a, inhibits production of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides both in cells and in animal models. It reduces both the beta-secretase and gamma-secretase cleavages of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and mediates a synergistic effect, when combined with a beta-secretase inhibitor, BACE IV. Toward developing more potent brain-permeable leads, we have synthesized and evaluated over 75 1a-analogues. Several compounds, including 2a-b and 3a-c, inhibited production of Abeta peptides with improved activity in cells. These compounds affected beta-secretase cleavage of APP similarly to 1a. Compound 2a significantly reduced production of the Abeta42 peptide, when administered (100 mg/kg, twice daily by oral gavage) to 5 months old female mice for 5 days. A combination of compound 2a with BACE IV also reduced Abeta levels in cells, more than the additive effect of the two compounds. These results open a new avenue for developing treatments for Alzheimer's disease using 1a-analogues.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Liver kinase B1 (LKB1)/5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, a metabolic checkpoint, plays a neuro-protective role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-beta (Abeta) acts as a classical biomarker of AD. The aim of the present study was to explore whether berberine (BBR) activates LKB1/AMPK signaling and ameliorates Abeta pathology. METHODS: The Abeta levels were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemistry. The following biomarkers were measured by Western blotting: phosphorylated (p-) LKB1 (Ser334 and Thr189), p-AMPK (AMPKalpha and AMPKbeta1), synaptophysin, post-synaptic density protein 95 and p-cAMP-response element binding protein (p-CREB). The glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was determined using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: BBR inhibited Abeta expression in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. There was a strong up-regulation of both p-LKB1 (Ser334 and Thr189) and p-AMPK (AMPKalpha and AMPKbeta1) in the brains of APP/PS1 transgenic mice after BBR-treatment (P<0.01). BBR promoted the expression of synaptophysin, post-synaptic density protein 95 and p-CREB(Ser133) in the AD brain, compared with the model mice. CONCLUSION: BBR alleviates Abeta pathogenesis and rescues synapse damage via activating LKB1/AMPK signaling in the brain of APP/PS1 transgenic mice.",

    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) can provide high resolution structural ensembles if the force field is accurate enough and if the simulation sufficiently samples the conformational space of the IDP with the correct weighting of sub-populations. Here, we investigate the combined force field-sampling problem by testing a standard force field as well as newer fixed charge force fields, the latter specifically motivated for better description of unfolded states and IDPs, and comparing them with a standard temperature replica exchange (TREx) protocol and a non-equilibrium Temperature Cool Walking (TCW) sampling algorithm. The force field and sampling combinations are used to characterize the structural ensembles of the amyloid-beta peptides Abeta42 and Abeta43, which both should be random coils as shown recently by experimental nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and 2D Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments. The results illustrate the key importance of the sampling algorithm: while the standard force field using TREx is in poor agreement with the NMR J-coupling and nuclear Overhauser effect and 2D FRET data, when using the TCW method, the standard and optimized protein-water force field combinations are in very good agreement with the same experimental data since the TCW sampling method produces qualitatively different ensembles than TREx. We also discuss the relative merit of the 2D FRET data when validating structural ensembles using the different force fields and sampling protocols investigated in this work for small IDPs such as the Abeta42 and Abeta43 peptides.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in cognitive performance have been noted in nondemented subjects with elevated accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) fibrils. However, it is not yet understood whether brain function is already influenced by Abeta deposition during the very earliest stages of the disease. We therefore investigated associations between [18F]Flutemetamol PET, resting-state functional connectivity, gray and white matter structure and cognitive performance in 133 cognitively normal elderly that exhibited normal global Abeta PET levels. [18F]Flutemetamol uptake in regions known to accumulate Abeta fibrils early in preclinical AD (i.e., mainly certain parts of the default-mode network) was positively associated with dynamic but not static functional connectivity (r = 0.77). Dynamic functional connectivity was further related to better cognitive performance (r = 0.21-0.72). No significant associations were found for Abeta uptake with gray matter volume or white matter diffusivity. The findings demonstrate that the earliest accumulation of Abeta fibrils is associated with increased functional connectivity, which occurs before any structural alterations. The enhanced functional connectivity may reflect a compensatory mechanism to maintain high cognitive performance in the presence of increasing amyloid accumulation during the earliest phases of AD.",

Here, we designed auditory tone stimulation that drove gamma frequency neural activity in auditory cortex (AC) and hippocampal CA1. Seven days of auditory GENUS improved spatial and recognition memory and reduced amyloid in AC and hippocampus of 5XFAD mice. Changes in activation responses were evident in microglia, astrocytes, and vasculature. Auditory GENUS also reduced phosphorylated tau in the P301S tauopathy model. Furthermore, combined auditory and visual GENUS, but not either alone, produced microglial-clustering responses, and decreased amyloid in medial prefrontal cortex. Whole brain analysis using SHIELD revealed widespread reduction of amyloid plaques throughout neocortex after multi-sensory GENUS. Thus, GENUS can be achieved through multiple sensory modalities with wide-ranging effects across multiple brain areas to improve cognitive function.",

They can be deposited in multiple organs but cardiac amyloid is the major risk factor of mortality. Here we report the structure of a lambda1 AL amyloid fibril from an explanted human heart at a resolution of 3.3 A which we determined using cryo-electron microscopy. The fibril core consists of a 91-residue segment presenting an all-beta fold with ten mutagenic changes compared to the germ line. The conformation differs substantially from natively folded light chains: a rotational switch around the intramolecular disulphide bond being the crucial structural rearrangement underlying fibril formation. Our structure provides insight into the mechanism of protein misfolding and the role of patient-specific mutations in pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "Owing to an early and marked deposition of amyloid-beta in the basal ganglia, autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease could distinctly involve motor symptoms. Therefore, we aimed to assess the prevalence and characteristics of motor signs in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. Baseline Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale part three scores (UPDRS-III) from 433 participants of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network observational study were analysed. Motor symptoms were scrutinized with respect to associations with mutation carrier status, mutation site within PSEN1, basal ganglia amyloid-beta as measured by Pittsburgh compound B PET, estimated years to symptom onset and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes. Motor findings in mutation carriers were compared to patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease using data of the National Alzheimer's Coordination Center. Mutation carriers showed motor findings at a higher frequency (28.4% versus 12.8%; P < 0.001) and severity (mean UPDRS-III scores 2.0 versus 0.4; P < 0.001) compared to non-carriers. Eleven of the 27 UPDRS-III items were statistically more frequently affected in mutation carriers after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Ten of these 11 items were subscale components of bradykinesia. In cognitively asymptomatic mutation carriers, dysdiadochokinesia was more frequent compared to non-carriers (right hand: 3.8% versus 0%; adjusted P = 0.023; left: 4.4% versus 0.6%; adjusted P = 0.031). In this cohort, the positive predictive value for mutation carrier status in cognitively asymptomatic participants (50% a priori risk) of dysdiadochokinesia was 100% for the right and 87.5% for the left side. Mutation carriers with motor findings more frequently were basal ganglia amyloid-beta positive (84% versus 63.3%; P = 0.006) and showed more basal ganglia amyloid-beta deposition (Pittsburgh compound B-standardized uptake value ratio 2.472 versus 1.928; P = 0.002) than those without. Frequency and severity of motor findings were greater in post-codon 200 PSEN1 mutations (36%; mean UPDRS-III score 3.03) compared to mutations pre-codon 200 PSEN1 (19.3%, P = 0.022; 0.91, P = 0.013). In mutation carriers, motor symptom severity was significantly positively correlated with basal ganglia amyloid-beta deposition, Clinical Dementia Rating scores and estimated years to symptom onset. Mutation carriers with a Clinical Dementia Rating global score of 2 exhibited more pronounced motor symptoms than sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients with the same Clinical Dementia Rating global score (mean UPDRS-III scores 20.71 versus 5.96; P < 0.001). With a prevalence of approximately 30% and increasing severity with progression of dementia, motor symptoms are proven as a clinically relevant finding in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease, in particular in advanced dementia stages, that correlates with deposition of amyloid-beta in the basal ganglia. In a very small per cent of cognitively asymptomatic members of families with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease, dysdiadochokinesia may increase the chance of an individual's status as mutation carrier.",

    "title": "Vascular phenotype of amyloid precursor protein-deficient mice.",
    "abstract": "The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is expressed in the blood vessel wall, but the physiological function of APP is not completely understood. Previous studies established that APP has amine oxidase activity responsible for degradation of catecholamines. In the present study, we characterized the vascular phenotype of APP-knockout (APP-/-) mice. We demonstrate that circulating levels of catecholamines are significantly increased in male as compared with female APP-/- mice. Studies of vasomotor function in isolated aortas revealed that contractions to the alpha1-receptor agonist phenylephrine were significantly reduced in male APP-/- mice but not in females. In addition, contractions to G protein activation with sodium fluoride were reduced exclusively in male APP-/- mice aortas. The endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were not affected by the loss of APP in mice of both sexes. Further analysis of the mechanisms underlying endothelium-dependent relaxations revealed that inhibition of cyclooxygenase by indomethacin significantly impaired relaxations to acetylcholine exclusively in male APP-/- mice. Furthermore, acetylcholine-induced production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) was significantly reduced in male APP-/- mice aortas while acetylcholine-induced production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) was enhanced. We concluded that altered vascular reactivity to phenylephrine appears to be in part the result of chronic exposure of male APP-/- aorta to high circulating levels of catecholamines. The mechanisms responsible for the impairment of endothelium-dependent cGMP signaling and adaptive enhancement of endothelium-dependent production of cAMP remain to be defined. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Male amyloid precursor protein (APP)-deficient mice have higher circulating levels of catecholamines as compared with female APP-deficient mice. As a consequence, endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasomotor functions of male APP-deficient mice are significantly altered. Under physiological conditions, expression of APP appears to play an important role in vascular function.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) originally identified ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 7 (ABCA7), as a novel risk gene of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since then, accumulating evidence from in vitro, in vivo, and human-based studies has corroborated and extended this association, promoting ABCA7 as one of the most important risk genes of both early-onset and late-onset AD, harboring both common and rare risk variants with relatively large effect on AD risk. Within this review, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the literature on ABCA7, with a focus on AD-related human -omics studies (e.g. genomics, transcriptomics, and methylomics). In European and African American populations, indirect ABCA7 GWAS associations are explained by expansion of an ABCA7 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR), and a common premature termination codon (PTC) variant, respectively. Rare ABCA7 PTC variants are strongly enriched in AD patients, and some of these have displayed inheritance patterns resembling autosomal dominant AD. In addition, rare missense variants are more frequent in AD patients than healthy controls, whereas a common ABCA7 missense variant may protect from disease. Methylation at several CpG sites in the ABCA7 locus is significantly associated with AD. Furthermore, ABCA7 contains many different isoforms and ABCA7 splicing has been shown to associate with AD. Besides associations with disease status, these genetic and epigenetic ABCA7 markers also showed significant correlations with AD endophenotypes; in particular amyloid deposition and brain morphology. In conclusion, human-based -omics studies provide converging evidence of (partial) ABCA7 loss as an AD pathomechanism, and future studies should make clear if interventions on ABCA7 expression can serve as a valuable therapeutic target for AD.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) in the brain is one of major pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Overactivation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling has been reported to lead to beta-amyloidogenesis. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of treadmill exercise on UPR signaling and the Abeta production and to demonstrate whether exercise-induced Abeta reduction was associated with changes in UPR signaling. Three-month old male APP/PS1 transgenic and wild-type mice were subjected to treadmill exercise for 3 months. At the end of exercise (6 months old), the levels of Abeta plaques and soluble forms of Abeta, and proteins involve in the unfolded protein response (UPR) were analyzed in the hippocampus. Three months of treadmill exercise resulted in a robust reduction in Abeta plaques and soluble forms of Abeta in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and presenilin-1 (PS1) expression. Meanwhile, we found that treadmill exercise down-regulated the expression of GRP78 and inhibited activation of PERK, eIF2alpha, and ATF4, reflecting the involvement of the UPR signaling. Overall, our findings suggest that treadmill exercise may suppresse the overactivation of the UPR signaling as well as inhibit the amyloidogenic pathway in APP/PS1 mice, thus may serve as an useful approach for the prevention and treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Soluble synaptotoxic aggregates of the main pathological proteins of Alzheimer's disease, amyloid beta-protein (Ass) and tau, have rapid and potent inhibitory effects on long-term potentiation (LTP). Although the promotion of synaptic weakening mechanisms, including long-term depression (LTD), is posited to mediate LTP inhibition by Ass, little is known regarding the action of exogenous tau on LTD. The present study examined the ability of different assemblies of full-length human tau to affect LTD in the dorsal hippocampus of the anaesthetized rat. Unlike Ass, intracerebroventricular injection of soluble aggregates of tau (StauAs), but not monomers or fibrils, potently increased the threshold for LTD induction in a manner that required cellular prion protein. However, MTEP, an antagonist of the putative prion protein coreceptor metabotropic glutamate receptor 5, did not prevent the disruption of synaptic plasticity by StauAs. In contrast, systemic treatment with Ro 25-6981, a selective antagonist at GluN2B subunit-containing NMDA receptors, reduced StauA-mediated inhibition of LTD, but not LTP. Intriguingly, StauAs completely blocked Ass-facilitated LTD, whereas a subthreshold dose of StauAs facilitated Ass-mediated inhibition of LTP. Overall, these findings support the importance of cellular prion protein in mediating a range of, sometimes opposing, actions of soluble Ass and tau aggregates with different effector mechanisms on synaptic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "The membrane protease gamma-secretase cleaves the C99 fragment of the amyloid precursor protein, thus producing the Abeta peptides central to Alzheimer's disease. Cryo-electron microscopy has provided the topology but misses the membrane and loop parts that contribute to substrate binding. We report here an essentially complete atomic model of C99 within wild-type gamma-secretase that respects all the experimental constraints and additionally describes loop, helix, and C99 substrate dynamics in a realistic all-atom membrane. Our model represents the matured auto-cleaved state required for catalysis. From two independent 500-ns molecular dynamic simulations, we identify two conformation states of C99 in equilibrium, a compact and a loose state. Our simulations provide a basis for C99 processing and Abeta formation and explain the production of longer and shorter Abeta, as the compact state retains C99 for longer and thus probably trims to shorter Abeta peptides. We expect pathogenic presenilin mutations to stabilize the loose over the compact state. The simulations detail the role of the Lys53-Lys54-Lys55 anchor for C99 binding, a loss of helicity of bound C99, and positioning of Thr48 and Leu49 leading to alternative trimming pathways on opposite sides of the C99 helix in three amino acid steps. The C99 binding topology resembles that of C83-bound gamma-secretase without membrane but lacks a presenilin 1-C99 beta-sheet, which could be induced by C83's stronger binding. The loose state should be selectively disfavored by gamma-secretase modulators to increase C99 trimming and reduce the formation of longer Abeta, a strategy that is currently much explored but has lacked a structural basis.",

A proteolytic product, soluble TREM2 (sTREM2), is abundant in the cerebrospinal fluid and its levels positively correlate with neuronal injury markers. To gain insights into the pathological roles of sTREM2, we studied sTREM2 in the brain of 5xFAD mice, a model of AD, by direct stereotaxic injection of recombinant sTREM2 protein or by adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression. We found that sTREM2 reduces amyloid plaque load and rescues functional deficits of spatial memory and long-term potentiation. Importantly, sTREM2 enhances microglial proliferation, migration, clustering in the vicinity of amyloid plaques and the uptake and degradation of Abeta. Depletion of microglia abolishes the neuroprotective effects of sTREM2. Our study demonstrates a protective role of sTREM2 against amyloid pathology and related toxicity and suggests that increasing sTREM2 can be explored for AD therapy.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus is one of the most affected areas in Alzheimer's disease (AD)1. Moreover, this structure hosts one of the most unique phenomena of the adult mammalian brain, namely, the addition of new neurons throughout life2. This process, called adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), confers an unparalleled degree of plasticity to the entire hippocampal circuitry3,4. Nonetheless, direct evidence of AHN in humans has remained elusive. Thus, determining whether new neurons are continuously incorporated into the human dentate gyrus (DG) during physiological and pathological aging is a crucial question with outstanding therapeutic potential. By combining human brain samples obtained under tightly controlled conditions and state-of-the-art tissue processing methods, we identified thousands of immature neurons in the DG of neurologically healthy human subjects up to the ninth decade of life. These neurons exhibited variable degrees of maturation along differentiation stages of AHN. In sharp contrast, the number and maturation of these neurons progressively declined as AD advanced. These results demonstrate the persistence of AHN during both physiological and pathological aging in humans and provide evidence for impaired neurogenesis as a potentially relevant mechanism underlying memory deficits in AD that might be amenable to novel therapeutic strategies.",

Therefore, a minimal-invasive reliable and cost-effective blood test is requested to power large clinical AD trials at reduced screening failure. Methods: We applied an immuno-infrared sensor to measure the amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau secondary structure distribution in plasma and CSF as structure-based biomarkers for AD (61 disease controls, 39 AD cases). Results: Within a first diagnostic screening step, the structure-based Abeta blood biomarker supports AD identification with a sensitivity of 90%. In a second diagnostic validation step, the combined use of the structure-based CSF biomarkers Abeta and tau excluded false-positive cases which offers an overall specificity of 97%. Discussion: The primary Abeta-based blood biomarker funnels individuals with suspected AD for subsequent validation of the diagnosis by structure-based combined analysis of the CSF biomarkers Abeta and tau. Our novel two-step recruitment strategy substantiates the diagnosis of AD with a likelihood of 29.",

    "title": "SORL1 genetic variants and Alzheimer disease risk: a literature review and meta-analysis of sequencing data.",
    "abstract": "Massive parallel sequencing recently allowed the identification of three genes carrying a higher burden of rare, protein-truncating and missense predicted damaging variants in Alzheimer disease (AD) cases as compared to controls: TREM2, SORL1, and ABCA7. SORL1 encodes SorLA, a key protein involved in the processing of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) precursor protein (APP) and the secretion of the Abeta peptide, the aggregation of which triggers AD pathophysiology. Common SORL1 single nucleotide polymorphisms had originally been associated with AD with modest odds ratios (ORs). The association of AD with rare SORL1 coding variants has been demonstrated at the gene level by aggregating protein-truncating (PTV) and rare predicted damaging missense variants. In addition to the loss of SorLA function induced by PTVs, a few missense variants were studied in vitro, showing diverse degrees of decreased SorLA function and leading to increased Abeta secretion. However, the exact functional consequences of most of the missense variants remain to be determined as well as corresponding levels of AD risk. Hereby we review the evidence of the association of SORL1 common and rare variants with AD risk and conduct a meta-analysis of published data on SORL1 rare variants in five large sequencing studies. We observe a significant enrichment in PTVs with ORs of 12.29 (95% confidence interval = [4.22-35.78]) among all AD cases and 27.50 [7.38-102.42] among early-onset cases. Rare [minor allele frequency (MAF) < 1%] and ultra-rare (MAF < 10-4) missense variants that are predicted damaging by 3/3 bioinformatics tools also show significant associations with corresponding ORs of 1.87 [1.54-2.28] and 3.14 [2.30-4.28], respectively. Per-domain analyses show significant association with the APP-binding CR cluster class A repeats and the Abeta-binding VPS10P domains, as well as the fibronectin type III domain, the function of which remains to be specified. These results further support a critical role for SORL1 rare coding variants in AD, although functional and segregation analyses are required to allow an accurate use in a clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "AIM: The apathetic syndrome is a common clinical feature in patients with Alzheimer diseases (AD), from preclinical phases to late stages of dementia, and it is strongly related to major disease outcomes. Unfortunately, no specific pharmacological treatments for apathy have been accomplished so far. Translational evidences have previously shown that a link between apathy and hallmarks of AD-related pathophysiology, that is, beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, exists. However, only few studies investigated the association between core biomarkers of AD and apathy scores, finding conflicting results. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients were identified as having AD dementia according to National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer Association 2011 criteria. All participants underwent an extensive diagnostic workup including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assessment to measure the concentrations of Abeta42, t-tau, and pTau181. To follow, they were stratified as: apathy absence, apathy mild, and apathy severe according to the Neuro Psychiatric Inventory-apathy item scores. We investigated for potential associations between apathy scores and CSF biomarkers concentrations as well as for differences in terms of clinical and CSF biomarkers data across the 3 apathy groups. RESULTS: The CSF Abeta42 concentrations were negatively correlated with apathy scores. In addition, patients with severe apathy had significantly lower Abeta42 levels compared to nonapathetic ones. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, we encourage further studies to untangle the potential association between the complex pathophysiological dynamics of AD and apathy which may represent an innovative reliable clinical outcome measure to use in clinical trials, investigating treatments with either a symptomatic or a disease-modifying effect.",

    "abstract": "The neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Some recent studies suggested that amyloid beta (Abeta) forms soluble oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils; the Abeta oligomers being more toxic than the fibrils. Surprisingly, these Abeta oligomers reportedly bind to prion protein (PrP), which acts as a receptor on the cell membrane, possibly resulting in AD. Thus, it is thought that compounds that can disrupt the formation of the prion-Abeta oligomer complex may prevent AD. Here, we demonstrate that an anti-prion RNA aptamer, R12, inhibits the interaction of PrP with Abeta. Fluorescence assaying involving thioflavin S showed that wild-type PrP, a mutant of the N-terminal half of PrP, and even fragment peptides of PrP effectively inhibit Abeta fibrillization. Fluorescence anisotropy revealed that R12 is capable of binding to PrP, resulting in dissociation of PrP with Abeta. Consequently, the Abeta that dissociated from PrP was shown to polymerize into fibrils. These spectroscopic observations were visualized by transmission electron microscopy. This is the first demonstration of the PrP-Abeta interaction being disrupted by a nucleic acid. This ability of R12 highlights its therapeutic potential for treating AD pathology.",

However, these types of antibodies are challenging to generate because of the large size, hydrophobicity, and heterogeneity of protein aggregates. To address this challenge, we developed a method for generating antibodies specific for amyloid aggregates. First, we grafted amyloidogenic peptide segments from the target polypeptide [Alzheimer's amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide] into the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of a stable antibody scaffold. Next, we diversified the grafted and neighboring CDR sites using focused mutagenesis to sample each WT or grafted residue, as well as one to five of the most commonly occurring amino acids at each site in human antibodies. Finally, we displayed these antibody libraries on the surface of yeast cells and selected antibodies that strongly recognize Abeta-amyloid fibrils and only weakly recognize soluble Abeta. We found that this approach enables the generation of monovalent and bivalent antibodies with nanomolar affinity for Abeta fibrils. These antibodies display high conformational and sequence specificity as well as low levels of nonspecific binding and recognize a conformational epitope at the extreme N terminus of human Abeta. We expect that this systematic approach will be useful for generating antibodies with conformational and sequence specificity against a wide range of peptide and protein aggregates associated with neurodegenerative disorders.",

The magnetite nanoparticles in the nanoassembly core enable the magnetic isolation of the captured Abeta peptides by generating a large attraction force under an external magnetic field. The ceria nanoparticles in the nanoassembly shell relieve oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species that are produced by immune response during the process.

Reduction in this decline is used to determine the efficacy of drug therapies designed to forestall the disease in preclinical AD clinical trials, measured by a Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC). Most studies estimate rates of cognitive change by comparing cognitively normal (CN) older adults with abnormally high beta-amyloid (Abeta+) to those with low levels (Abeta-). However, participants of preclinical AD clinical trials must be Abeta+ for entry. Therefore, we estimated the effect of very high amyloid (Abeta++) and Abeta+ on cognitive change over three years measured by different versions of the PACC in individuals with preclinical AD. Method: CN older adults underwent Abeta neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessments over three years as part of the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study. Three cognitive composite scores were computed: the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS)-PACC, the ADCS-PACC with no Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the z-scores of Attention, Verbal Fluency and Episodic Memory for Nondemented Older Adults (ZAVEN) composite. Results: Compared to the Abeta++ group, the Abeta+ group showed a slower rate of cognitive decline with the largest magnitude of difference reflected by the ADCS-PACC (d = 0.85). The ADCS-PACC excluding the MMSE and the ZAVEN also reflected a moderate to large magnitude of difference between groups (d = 0.62, d = 0.72, respectively). Conclusions: When all individuals have abnormal Abeta, the level of Abeta at baseline is associated with the rate of subsequent decline. The ADCS-PACC was the most sensitive composite score in showing that lower Abeta is associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline; however, there are limitations to the use of the MMSE. These results provide a benchmark of comparison for preclinical AD clinical trials aiming to slow cognitive deterioration.",

    "abstract": "Monomers and oligomers of the amyloid-beta peptide aggregate to form the fibrils found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. These monomers and oligomers are largely disordered and can interact with transition metal ions, affecting the mechanism and kinetics of amyloid-beta aggregation. Due to the disordered nature of amyloid-beta, its rapid aggregation, as well as solvent and paramagnetic effects, experimental studies face challenges in the characterization of transition metal ions bound to amyloid-beta monomers and oligomers. The details of the coordination chemistry between transition metals and amyloid-beta obtained from experiments remain debated. Furthermore, the impact of transition metal ion binding on the monomeric or oligomeric amyloid-beta structures and dynamics are still poorly understood. Computational chemistry studies can serve as an important complement to experimental studies and can provide additional knowledge on the binding between amyloid-beta and transition metal ions. Many research groups conducted first-principles calculations, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, quantum mechanics/classical mechanics simulations, and classical molecular dynamics simulations for studying the interplay between transition metal ions and amyloid-beta monomers and oligomers. This review summarizes the current understanding of transition metal interactions with amyloid-beta obtained from computational chemistry studies. We also emphasize the current view of the coordination chemistry between transition metal ions and amyloid-beta. This information represents an important foundation for future metal ion chelator and drug design studies aiming to combat Alzheimer's disease.",

Molecular interrogation of the Abeta plaque environment revealed elevated levels of transcripts encoding proteins involved in OPC function, replicative senescence, and inflammation. Direct exposure of cultured OPCs to aggregating Abeta triggered cell senescence. Senolytic treatment of AD mice selectively removed senescent cells from the plaque environment, reduced neuroinflammation, lessened Abeta load, and ameliorated cognitive deficits. Our findings suggest a role for Abeta-induced OPC cell senescence in neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits in AD, and a potential therapeutic benefit of senolytic treatments.",

    "abstract": "An early pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits in the brain, which largely consist of up to 43 amino acids long Abeta peptides derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). We previously identified a series of sialylated Tyr-10 O-glycosylated Abeta peptides, 15-20 residues long, from human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and observed a relative increase of those in AD vs non-AD patients. We report here on the synthesis and use of an isotopically double-labeled Abeta1-15 glycopeptide, carrying the core 1 Galbeta3GalNAcalpha1-O-Tyr-10 structure, to (1) identify by HCD LC-MS/MS the definite glycan core 1 structure of immunopurified and desialylated Abeta glycopeptides in human CSF and to (2) establish a LC-MS/MS quantification method for desialylated Abeta1-15 (and Abeta1-17) glycopeptides and to (3) compare the concentrations of these Abeta glycopeptides in CSF from 20 AD patients and 20 healthy controls. Although we unambiguously identified the core 1 structures and Tyr-10 attachment sites of the glycopeptides, we did not observe any quantitative differences, determined through both peptide and oxonium ion fragments, of the desialylated Abeta1-15 or Abeta1-17 glycopeptides between the AD and non-AD group. The new quantitative glycoproteomic approach described, using double-labeled glycopeptide standards, will undoubtedly facilitate future studies of glycopeptides as clinical biomarkers but should also embrace sialylated Abeta standards to reveal specific sialylation patterns of individual Abeta glycopeptides in AD patients and controls.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of insoluble amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain is known to trigger the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. In spite of the massive number of investigations, the underlying mechanisms to destabilize the Abeta aggregates are still poorly understood. Some studies indicate the importance of oxidation to destabilize the Abeta aggregates. In particular, oxidation induced by cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has demonstrated promising results in eliminating these toxic aggregates. In this paper, we investigate the effect of oxidation on the stability of an Abeta pentamer. By means of molecular dynamics simulations and umbrella sampling, we elucidate the conformational changes of Abeta pentamer in the presence of oxidized residues, and we estimate the dissociation free energy of the terminal peptide out of the pentamer form. The calculated dissociation free energy of the terminal peptide is also found to decrease with increasing oxidation. This indicates that Abeta pentamer aggregation becomes less favorable upon oxidation. Our study contributes to a better insight in one of the potential mechanisms for inhibition of toxic Abeta peptide aggregation, which is considered to be the main culprit to Alzheimer's disease.",

Two hundred thirty-nine participants (aged 56-89 years, clinical dementia rating = 0) underwent serial CSF collection for Abeta1-42, total-tau (t-tau) and phospho-tau181P (p-tau). We used preprocessed data from fully automated Roche Elecsys immunoassays. A series of linear regressions were used to examine cross-sectional effects of Abeta1-42, sex, and APOEepsilon4 on baseline CSF tau and linear mixed models for longitudinal changes in CSF tau. Cross-sectionally, CSF t-tau and p-tau were associated with abnormal Abeta1-42 and APOEepsilon4 but not with sex. Longitudinally, low baseline CSF Abeta1-42 levels, but not APOEepsilon4 or sex, predicted faster p-tau accumulation. The relationship between baseline CSF Abeta1-42 and tau accumulation was strongest in APOEepsilon4 carriers, and particularly female carriers, relative to other groups. The current findings support an association between baseline CSF Abeta1-42 and changes in CSF tau. Elevated risk in females, apparent only in carriers, reinforces findings of sex-related vulnerability in those with genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease.",

Abeta is reported to have various impacts on the lipid bilayer, but a clearer picture of Abeta influence on membranes is required. Here, we use atomic force and transmission electron microscopies to image the impact of different isolated Abeta assembly types on lipid bilayers. We show that only oligomeric Abeta can profoundly disrupt the bilayer, visualized as widespread lipid extraction and subsequent deposition, which can be likened to an effect expected from the action of a detergent. We further show that Abeta oligomers cause widespread curvature and discontinuities within lipid vesicle membranes. In contrast, this detergent-like effect was not observed for Abeta monomers and fibers, although Abeta fibers did laterally associate and embed into the upper leaflet of the bilayer. The marked impact of Abeta oligomers on membrane integrity identified here reveals a mechanism by which these oligomers may be cytotoxic.",

This finding sparked interest in this member of the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectin family which is linked to innate immunity. Subsequent studies found that CD33 is expressed in microglia in the brain and then investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the CD33 genetic association with Alzheimer's disease. The allele that protects from Alzheimer's disease acts predominately to increase a CD33 isoform lacking exon 2 at the expense of the prototypic, full-length CD33 that contains exon 2. Since this exon encodes the sialic acid ligand-binding domain, the finding that the loss of exon 2 was associated with decreased Alzheimer's disease risk was interpreted as meaning that a decrease in functional CD33 and its associated immune suppression was protective from Alzheimer's disease. However, this interpretation may need to be reconsidered given current findings that a genetic deletion which abrogates CD33 is not associated with Alzheimer's disease risk. Therefore, integrating currently available findings leads us to propose a model wherein the CD33 isoform lacking the ligand-binding domain represents a gain of function variant that reduces Alzheimer's disease risk.",

RD2 has been described to have an oral bioavailability of more than 75% and to improve cognition in transgenic Alzheimer's disease mouse models after oral administration. In the present study, we further examined the stability of RD2 in simulated gastrointestinal fluids, blood plasma and liver microsomes. In addition, we have examined whether RD2 is a substrate for the human D-amino acid oxidase (hDAAO). Furthermore, metabolite profiles of RD2 incubated in human, rodent and non-rodent liver microsomes were compared across species to search for human-specific metabolites that might possibly constitute a threat when applying the compound in humans. RD2 was remarkably resistant against metabolization in all investigated media and not converted by hDAAO. Moreover, RD2 did not influence the activity of any of the tested enzymes. In conclusion, the high stability and the absence of relevant human-specific metabolites support RD2 to be safe for oral administration in humans.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Altered amyloid metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction play key roles in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We asked whether an association exists between disturbed platelet mitochondrial respiration and the plasma concentrations of Abeta40 and Abeta42 in patients with AD. DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 concentrations and mitochondrial respiration in intact and permeabilized platelets were measured in 50 patients with AD, 15 patients with vascular dementia and 25 control subjects. A pilot longitudinal study was performed to monitor the progression of AD in a subgroup 11 patients with AD. RESULTS: The mean Abeta40, Abeta42 and Abeta42/Abeta40 levels were not significantly altered in patients with AD compared with controls. The mitochondrial respiratory rate in intact platelets was significantly reduced in patients with AD compared to controls, particularly the basal respiratory rate, maximum respiratory capacity, and respiratory reserve; however, the flux control ratio for basal respiration was increased. A correlation between the plasma Abeta42 concentration and mitochondrial respiration in both intact and permeabilized platelets differs in controls and patients with AD. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our data, (1) mitochondrial respiration in intact platelets, but not the Abeta level itself, may be included in a panel of biomarkers for AD; (2) dysfunctional mitochondrial respiration in platelets is not explained by changes in plasma Abeta concentrations; and (3) the association between mitochondrial respiration in platelets and plasma Abeta levels differs in patients with AD and controls. The results supported the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction is the primary factor contributing to the development of AD.",

    "title": "Association Between Amyloid-beta, Small-vessel Disease, and Neurodegeneration Biomarker Positivity, and Progression to Mild Cognitive Impairment in Cognitively Normal Individuals.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We estimated the prevalence and incidence of amyloid-beta deposition (A), small-vessel disease (V), and neurodegeneration (N) biomarker positivity in community-dwelling cognitively normal individuals (CN). We determined the longitudinal association between the respective biomarker indices with progression to all-cause mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and its amnestic and nonamnestic subtypes. METHODS: CN participants, recruited by advertising, underwent brain [C-11]Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB)-positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging, and [F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose (FDG)-PET, and were designated as having high or low amyloid-beta (A+/A-), greater or lower white matter hyperintensities burden (V+/V-) and diminished or normal cortical glucose metabolism (N+/N-). MCI was adjudicated using clinical assessments. We examined the association between A, V, and N biomarker positivity at study baseline and endpoint, with progression to MCI using linear regression, Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan-Meier analyses adjusted for age and APOE-epsilon4 carrier status. RESULTS: In 98 CN individuals (average age 74 years, 65% female), A+, V+, and N+ prevalence was 26%, 33%, and 8%, respectively. At study endpoint (median: 5.5 years), an A+, but not a V+ or N+ scan, was associated with higher odds of all-cause MCI (Chi-square = 3.9, p = .048, odds ratio, 95% confidence interval = 2.6 [1.01-6.8]). Baseline A+, V+, or N+ were not associated with all-cause MCI, however, baseline A+ (p = .018) and A+N+ (p = .049), and endpoint A+N+ (p = .025) were associated with time to progression to amnestic, not nonamnestic, MCI. CONCLUSION: Longitudinal assessments clarify the association between amyloid-beta and progression to all-cause MCI in CN individuals. The association between biomarker positivity indices of amyloid-beta and neurodegeneration, and amnestic MCI reflects the underlying pathology involved in the progression to prodromal Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "The internal structure of amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers was investigated with isotope-edited Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Homo-oligomers of Abeta40 and Abeta42 were prepared from unlabeled and 13C, 15N-labeled monomeric Abeta and from mixtures of these. For the unlabeled peptides, two main bands were observed in 2H2O at 1685 and 1622 cm-1 for Abeta40 and at 1685 and 1626 cm-1 for Abeta42. These band positions indicate that the number of strands per sheet is at least four. The obtained experimental amide I spectra were simulated using a number of structural models (antiparallel beta-sheets, beta-barrels and a dodecamer structure). According to experiments and calculations, the main 13C-band shifts down at increasing molar ratio of labeled peptides. This shift occurs when vibrational coupling becomes possible between 13C-amide groups in close-by strands. It is small, when intervening 12C-strands increase the distance between 13C-strands; it is large, when many neighboring strands are labeled. The shift depends on the internal structure of the peptides within the oligomers, i.e. on the building block that each peptide molecule contributes to the beta-sheets of the oligomers. The shift is largest, when individual peptides contribute just a single strand surrounded by strands from other peptide molecules. It is smaller when each molecule forms two or three adjacent strands. As indicated by a comparison between experiment and computation, the number of adjacent beta-strands per peptide molecule is two for Abeta40 oligomers and two or more for Abeta42 oligomers. Our results are well explained by regular, antiparallel beta-sheets or beta-barrels.",

    "abstract": "Postsynaptic trafficking plays a key role in regulating synapse structure and function. While spiny excitatory synapses can be stable throughout adult life, their morphology and function is impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known about how AD risk genes impact synaptic function. Here we used structured superresolution illumination microscopy (SIM) to study the late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) risk factor BIN1, and show that this protein is abundant in postsynaptic compartments, including spines. While postsynaptic Bin1 shows colocalization with clathrin, a major endocytic protein, it also colocalizes with the small GTPases Rab11 and Arf6, components of the exocytic pathway. Bin1 participates in protein complexes with Arf6 and GluA1, and manipulations of Bin1 lead to changes in spine morphology, AMPA receptor surface expression and trafficking, and AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. Our data provide new insights into the mesoscale architecture of postsynaptic trafficking compartments and their regulation by a major LOAD risk factor.",

    "title": "Neonatal infection leads to increased susceptibility to Abeta oligomer-induced brain inflammation, synapse loss and cognitive impairment in mice.",
    "abstract": "Harmful environmental stimuli during critical stages of development can profoundly affect behavior and susceptibility to diseases. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most frequent neurodegenerative disease, and evidence suggest that inflammatory conditions act cumulatively, contributing to disease onset. Here we investigated whether infection early in life can contribute to synapse damage and cognitive impairment induced by amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaOs), neurotoxins found in AD brains. To this end, wild-type mice were subjected to neonatal (post-natal day 4) infection by Escherichia coli (1 x 104 CFU/g), the main cause of infection in low-birth-weight premature infants in the US. E. coli infection caused a transient inflammatory response in the mouse brain starting shortly after infection. Although infected mice performed normally in behavioral tasks in adulthood, they showed increased susceptibility to synapse damage and memory impairment induced by low doses of AbetaOs (1 pmol; intracerebroventricular) in the novel object recognition paradigm. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we show that microglial cells from E. coli-infected mice undergo exacerbated activation when exposed to low doses of AbetaOs. In addition, treatment of infected pups with minocycline, an antibiotic that inhibits microglial pro-inflammatory polarization, normalized microglial response to AbetaOs and restored normal susceptibility of mice to oligomer-induced cognitive impairment. Interestingly, mice infected with by E. coli (1 x 104 CFU/g) during adolescence (post-natal day 21) or adulthood (post-natal day 60) showed normal cognitive performance even in the presence of AbetaOs (1 pmol), suggesting that only infections at critical stages of development may lead to increased susceptibility to amyloid-beta-induced toxicity. Altogether, our findings suggest that neonatal infections can modulate microglial response to AbetaOs into adulthood, thus contributing to amyloid-beta-induced synapse damage and cognitive impairment.",

We also analysed matched CSF, post-mortem brain tissue, and iPSCs from the same participant with the APP V717I mutation. All fAD mutation lines demonstrated an increased Abeta42:40 ratio relative to controls, yet displayed varied signatures for Abeta43, Abeta38, and short Abeta fragments. We propose four qualitatively distinct mechanisms behind raised Abeta42:40. (1) APP V717I mutations alter gamma-secretase cleavage site preference. Whereas, distinct presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutations lead to either (2) reduced gamma-secretase activity, (3) altered protein stability or (4) reduced PSEN1 maturation, all culminating in reduced gamma-secretase carboxypeptidase-like activity.

    "title": "Quantitative assessment of oligomeric amyloid beta peptide binding to alpha7 nicotinic receptor.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Progressive dysfunction of cholinergic transmission is a well-known characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide oligomers are known to play a central role in AD and are suggested to impair the function of the cholinergic nicotinic ACh receptor alpha7 (alpha7nAChR). However, the mechanism underlying the effect of Abeta on alpha7nAChR function is not fully understood, limiting the therapeutic exploration of this observation in AD. Here, we aimed to detect and characterize Abeta binding to alpha7nAChR, including the possibility of interfering with this interaction for therapeutic purposes. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We developed a specific and quantitative time-resolved FRET (TR-FRET)-based binding assay for Abeta to alpha7nAChR and pharmacologically characterized this interaction. KEY RESULTS: We demonstrated specific and high-affinity (low nanomolar) binding of Abeta to the orthosteric binding site of alpha7nAChR. Abeta binding was prevented and reversed by the well-characterized orthosteric ligands of alpha7nAChR (epibatidine, alpha-bungarotoxin, methylylcaconitine, PNU-282987, S24795, and EVP6124) and by the type II positive allosteric modulator (PAM) PNU-120596 but not by the type I PAM NS1738. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our TR-FRET Abeta binding assay demonstrates for the first time the specific binding of Abeta to alpha7nAChR, which will be a crucial tool for the development, testing, and selection of a novel generation of AD drug candidates targeting Abeta/alpha7nAChR complexes with high specificity and fewer side effects compared to currently approved alpha7nAChR drugs.

    "title": "The new genetic landscape of Alzheimer's disease: from amyloid cascade to genetically driven synaptic failure hypothesis?",
    "abstract": "A strong genetic predisposition (60-80% of attributable risk) is present in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In view of this major genetic component, identification of the genetic risk factors has been a major objective in the AD field with the ultimate aim to better understand the pathological processes. In this review, we present how the genetic risk factors are involved in APP metabolism, beta-amyloid peptide production, degradation, aggregation and toxicity, innate immunity, and Tau toxicity. In addition, on the basis of the new genetic landscape, resulting from the recent high-throughput genomic approaches and emerging neurobiological information, we propose an over-arching model in which the focal adhesion pathway and the related cell signalling are key elements in AD pathogenesis. The core of the focal adhesion pathway links the physiological functions of amyloid precursor protein and Tau with the pathophysiological processes they are involved in. This model includes several entry points, fitting with the different origins for the disease, and supports the notion that dysregulation of synaptic plasticity is a central node in AD. Notably, our interpretation of the latest data from genome wide association studies complements other hypotheses already developed in the AD field, i.e., amyloid cascade, cellular phase or propagation hypotheses. Genetically driven synaptic failure hypothesis will need to be further tested experimentally within the general AD framework.",

Methods: Amyloid beta peptides (Abeta[1-40], Abeta[1-42]) and total Tau plasma concentrations were quantified using fully automated Roche Elecsys assays. Results: Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-42), and total Tau plasma concentrations were not affected by up to three freeze/thaw cycles, up to five tube transfers, the collection tube material, or the size; circadian rhythm had a minor effect. All three biomarkers were influenced by the anticoagulant used, particularly total Tau. Abeta concentrations began decreasing 1 hour after blood draw/before centrifugation and decreased by up to 5% and 10% at 2 and 6 hours, respectively. For separated plasma, time to measurement influenced Abeta levels by up to 7% after 6 hours and 10% after 24 hours. Discussion: Our findings provide guidance for standardizing blood sample collection, handling, and storage to ensure reliable analysis of Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers in routine practice and clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of mutations in somatic cells has been implicated as a cause of aging since the 1950s. However, attempts to establish a causal relationship between somatic mutations and aging have been constrained by the lack of methods to directly identify mutational events in primary human tissues. Here we provide genome-wide mutation frequencies and spectra of human B lymphocytes from healthy individuals across the entire human lifespan using a highly accurate single-cell whole-genome sequencing method. We found that the number of somatic mutations increases from <500 per cell in newborns to >3,000 per cell in centenarians. We discovered mutational hotspot regions, some of which, as expected, were located at Ig genes associated with somatic hypermutation (SHM). B cell-specific mutation signatures associated with development, aging, or SHM were found. The SHM signature strongly correlated with the signature found in human B cell tumors, indicating that potential cancer-causing events are already present even in B cells of healthy individuals. We also identified multiple mutations in sequence features relevant to cellular function (i.e., transcribed genes and gene regulatory regions). Such mutations increased significantly during aging, but only at approximately one-half the rate of the genome average, indicating selection against mutations that impact B cell function. This full characterization of the landscape of somatic mutations in human B lymphocytes indicates that spontaneous somatic mutations accumulating with age can be deleterious and may contribute to both the increased risk for leukemia and the functional decline of B lymphocytes in the elderly.",

    "abstract": "Oleuropein aglycone (OleA), the most abundant polyphenol in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), and Hydroxythyrosol (HT), the OleA main metabolite, have attracted our interest due to their multitarget effects, including the interference with amyloid aggregation path. However, the mechanistic details of their anti-amyloid effect are not known yet. We report here a broad biophysical approach and cell biology techniques that enabled us to characterize the different molecular mechanisms by which OleA and HT modulate the Abeta1-42 fibrillation, a main histopathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, OleA prevents the growth of toxic Abeta1-42 oligomers and blocks their successive growth into mature fibrils following its interaction with the peptide N-terminus, while HT speeds up harmless fibril formation. Our data demonstrate that, by stabilizing oligomers and fibrils, both polyphenols reduce their seeding activity and aggregate/membrane interaction on human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. These findings highlight the great potential of EVOO polyphenols and offer the possibility to validate and to optimize their use for possible AD prevention and therapy.",

    "title": "Ubiquitin binds the amyloid beta peptide and interferes with its clearance pathways.",
    "abstract": "Several lines of evidence point to a compromised proteostasis associated with a reduction of the Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) activity in patients affected by Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and suggest that the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) is an important player in the game. Inspired also by many reports, underlining the presence of ubiquitin (Ub) in the amyloid plaques of AD brains, here we set out to test whether Ub may bind the Abeta peptide and have any effect on its clearance pathways. By using an integrated array of MALDI-TOF/UPLC-HRMS, fluorescence, NMR, SPR, Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) and molecular dynamics studies, we consistently demonstrated that Abeta40 binds Ub with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry and K d in the high micromolar range. In particular, we show that the N-terminal domain of the Abeta peptide (through residues D1, E3 and R5) interacts with the C-terminal tail of Ub (involving residues K63 and E64), inducing the central region of Abeta (14HQKLVFFAEDVGSNK28) to adopt a mixed alpha-helix/beta-turn structure. ELISA assays, carried out in neuroblastoma cell lysates, suggest that Abeta competitively binds Ub also in the presence of the entire pool of cytosolic Ub binding proteins. Ub-bound Abeta has a lower tendency to aggregate into amyloid-like fibrils and is more slowly degraded by the Insulin Degrading Enzyme (IDE). Finally, we observe that the water soluble fragment Abeta1-16 significantly inhibits Ub chain growth reactions. These results evidence how the non-covalent interaction between Abeta peptides and Ub may have relevant effects on the regulation of the upstream events of the UPS and pave the way to future in vivo studies addressing the role played by Abeta peptide in the malfunction of proteome maintenance occurring in AD.",

    "abstract": "The aggregates of the Abeta peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease are able to both grow in size as well as generate, through secondary nucleation, new small oligomeric species, that are major cytotoxins associated with neuronal death. Despite the importance of these amyloid fibril-dependent processes, their structural and molecular underpinnings have remained challenging to elucidate. Here, we consider two molecular chaperones: the Brichos domain, which suppresses specifically secondary nucleation processes, and clusterin which our results show is capable of inhibiting, specifically, the elongation of Abeta fibrils at remarkably low substoichiometric ratios. Microfluidic diffusional sizing measurements demonstrate that this inhibition originates from interactions of clusterin with fibril ends with high affinity. Kinetic experiments in the presence of both molecular chaperones reveal that their inhibitory effects are additive and noncooperative, thereby indicating that the reactive sites associated with the formation of new aggregates and the growth of existing aggregates are distinct.",

Plasma Abeta is deemed a less invasive and more accessible hallmark of AD, as Abeta can penetrate blood-brain barriers. However, correlations between biofluidic Abeta concentrations and AD progression has been tenuous. Here, we introduce a diagnostic technique that compares the heterogeneous and the monomerized states of Abeta in plasma. We used a small molecule, EPPS [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid], to dissociate aggregated Abeta into monomers to enhance quantification accuracy. Subsequently, Abeta levels of EPPS-treated plasma were compared to those of untreated samples to minimize inter- and intraindividual variations. The interdigitated microelectrode sensor system was used to measure plasma Abeta levels on a scale of 0.1 pg/ml. The implementation of this self-standard blood test resulted in substantial distinctions between patients with AD and individuals with normal cognition (NC), with selectivity and sensitivity over 90%.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the principal apolipoprotein associated with high-density lipoproteins in the periphery, is also found at high concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid. Previous studies have reported either no impact or vascular-specific effects of apoA-I knockout (KO) on beta-amyloid (Abeta) pathology. However, the putative mechanism(s) by which apoA-I may influence Abeta deposition is unknown. METHODS: We evaluated the effect of apoA-I deletion on Abeta pathology, Abeta production and clearance from the brain in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). RESULTS: Contrary to previous reports, deletion of the APOA1 gene significantly reduced concentrations of insoluble Abeta40 and Abeta42 and reduced plaque load in both the parenchyma and blood vessels of apoA-I KO x Tg2576 mice compared to Tg2576 animals. This was not due to decreased Abeta production or alterations in Abeta species. Levels of soluble clusterin/apoJ were significantly higher in neurons of apoA-I KO mice compared to both wildtype (WT) and apoA-I KO x Tg2576 mice. In addition, clearance of Abeta along intramural periarterial drainage pathways was significantly higher in apoA-I KO mice compared to WT animals. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that deletion of apoA-I is associated with increased clearance of Abeta and reduced parenchymal and vascular Abeta pathology in the Tg2576 model. These results suggest that peripheral dyslipidaemia can modulate the expression of apolipoproteins in the brain and may influence Abeta clearance and aggregation in AD.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant interactions of metal ions with amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) can potentiate Alzheimer's disease (AD) by participating in the aggregation process of Abeta and in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Metallothionein-3 (MT3), which is aberrantly expressed in AD brains, is believed to play an important role in the AD progression due to its ability of maintaining metal homeostasis and scavenging ROS. However, the related molecular mechanism is not clear. In this work, the metal-dependent interactions of MT3 beta-domain (betaMT3) with amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) were systematically studied. The results showed that Zn3-betaMT3 has a higher affinity to Abeta (Kd: ~0.7 muM) than Cu4-betaMT3 (Kd: ~22 muM). In Zn3-betaMT3, both Pro7 and Pro9 face outwards with their five-member rings in parallel, favoring their binding with aromatic residues via CH/pi interactions. Two aromatic residues (Phe4 and Tyr10) in Abeta were identified as the specific binding sites for betaMT3. Based on these, we posit a characteristic in-situ protection role of Zn-MT3 in inhibiting the Cu2+-induced Abeta neurotoxicity, in which stable Zn-MT3/Abeta complex forms via the Zn3-betaMT3/Abeta interaction and effectively prevents the formation of Cu-Abeta in high viscosity physiological fluids. Our results provide the mechanistic pathway and the specific roles of betaMT3 in its protective bioactivity against AD progression, which means significant for elucidating the function of MT3 in AD neuropathology and for designing a MT3-related therapeutic strategy for AD.",

    "abstract": "Importance: Plasma neurofilament light (NfL) has been suggested as a noninvasive biomarker to monitor neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease (AD), but studies are lacking. Objective: To examine whether longitudinal plasma NfL levels are associated with other hallmarks of AD. Design, Setting, and Participants: This North American cohort study used data from 1583 individuals in the multicenter Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study from September 7, 2005, through June 16, 2016. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had NfL measurements. Annual plasma NfL samples were collected for up to 11 years and were analyzed in 2018. Exposures: Clinical diagnosis, Abeta and tau cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, imaging measures (magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography), and tests on cognitive scores. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the association between baseline exposures (diagnosis, CSF biomarkers, imaging measures, and cognition) and longitudinal plasma NfL levels, analyzed by an ultrasensitive assay. The secondary outcomes were the associations between a multimodal classification scheme with Abeta, tau, and neurodegeneration (ie, the ATN system) and plasma NfL levels and between longitudinal changes in plasma NfL levels and changes in the other measures. Results: Of the included 1583 participants, 716 (45.2%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 72.9 (7.1) years; 401 had no cognitive impairment, 855 had mild cognitive impairment, and 327 had AD dementia. The NfL level was increased at baseline in patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia (mean levels: cognitive unimpairment, 32.1 ng/L; mild cognitive impairment, 37.9 ng/L; and AD dementia, 45.9 ng/L; P < .001) and increased in all diagnostic groups, with the greatest increase in patients with AD dementia. A longitudinal increase in NfL level correlated with baseline CSF biomarkers (low Abeta42 [P = .001], high total tau [P = .02], and high phosphorylated tau levels [P = .02]), magnetic resonance imaging measures (small hippocampal volumes [P < .001], thin regional cortices [P = .009], and large ventricular volumes [P = .002]), low fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography uptake (P = .01), and poor cognitive performance (P < .001) for a global cognitive score. With use of the ATN system, increased baseline NfL levels were seen in A-T+N+ (P < .001), A+T-N+ (P < .001), and A+T+N+ (P < .001), and increased rates of NfL levels were seen in A-T+N- (P = .009), A-T+N+ (P = .02), A+T-N+ (P = .04), and A+T+N+ (P = .002). Faster increase in NfL levels correlated with faster increase in CSF biomarkers of neuronal injury, faster rates of atrophy and hypometabolism, and faster worsening in global cognition (all P < .05 in patients with mild cognitive impairment; associations differed slightly in cognitively unimpaired controls and patients with AD dementia). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that plasma NfL can be used as a noninvasive biomarker associated with neurodegeneration in patients with AD and may be useful to monitor effects in trials of disease-modifying drugs.",

    "title": "Association of Cortical beta-Amyloid Protein in the Absence of Insoluble Deposits With Alzheimer Disease.",
    "abstract": "Importance: beta-Amyloid deposits are a pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the extent to which cortical beta-amyloid protein in the absence of insoluble deposits is associated with classic features of AD appear to be unknown. Objective: To examine the associations of cortical beta-amyloid protein in the absence of insoluble deposits with cognitive decline, neurofibrillary tangles, other age-associated neuropathologic conditions, and APOE. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analysis combines data from 2 community-based clinicopathologic cohort studies of aging. The Religious Orders Study started in 1994, and the Rush Memory and Aging Project started in 1997. Both studies are ongoing. Participants without known dementia were enrolled and agreed to annual clinical evaluations and brain donation after death. Primary analyses focused on individuals without beta-amyloid deposits. Data analyses occurred in mid-September 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: beta-Amyloid protein abundance was measured by targeted proteomics using selected reaction monitoring. beta-Amyloid deposits were detected using immunohistochemistry. Other neuropathologic indices were quantified via uniform structured evaluation. Linear mixed models were used to examine the association of beta-amyloid protein with cognitive decline. Regression models examined the protein associations with neuropathologic outcomes and the APOE genotype. Results: By mid-September 2018, 3575 older persons were enrolled, and 1559 had died and undergone brain autopsy. Proteomic data were collected in 1208 individuals, and 5 with missing cognitive scores were excluded. Of the remaining 1203, primary analyses focused on 148 individuals (12.3%) without beta-amyloid deposits. In this group, the mean (SD) age at death was 87.0 (7.0) years, and 84 individuals (56.8%) were women. In the absence of beta-amyloid deposits, we did not observe an association of beta-amyloid protein with decline in episodic memory, but the protein was associated with faster rates of decline in processing speed (mean [SE] change, -0.014 [0.005]; P = .008) and visuospatial abilities (mean [SE] change, -0.013 [0.005]; P = .006). We did not observe protein association with paired helical filament tau tangle density. The protein was associated with amyloid angiopathy (odds ratio, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.15-1.67]; P < .001) but no other brain pathology. The associations with cognitive decline were unchanged after controlling for amyloid angiopathy. Neither APOE epsilon4 nor a polygenic Alzheimer risk score was associated with beta-amyloid protein. Conclusions and Relevance: Cortical beta-amyloid protein was associated with faster cognitive decline in the absence of beta-amyloid deposits, which supports the role of cortical soluble beta-amyloid as a neurotoxic agent in aging. The lack of protein association with paired helical filament tau tangles, episodic memory decline, or strong genetic drivers of deposited beta-amyloid suggests an underlying neuropathologic change that may differ from that of AD.",

    "abstract": "The advent of tau-targeted PET tracers such as flortaucipir (18F) (flortaucipir, also known as 18F-AV-1451 or 18F-T807) have made it possible to investigate the sequence of development of tau in relationship to age, amyloid-beta, and to the development of cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. Here we report a multicentre longitudinal evaluation of the relationships between baseline tau, tau change and cognitive change, using flortaucipir PET imaging. A total of 202 participants 50 years old or older, including 57 cognitively normal subjects, 97 clinically defined mild cognitive impairment and 48 possible or probable Alzheimer's disease dementia patients, received flortaucipir PET scans of 20 min in duration beginning 80 min after intravenous administration of 370 MBq flortaucipir (18F). On separate days, subjects also received florbetapir amyloid PET imaging, and underwent a neuropsychological test battery. Follow-up flortaucipir scans and neuropsychological battery assessments were also performed at 9 and 18 months. Fifty-five amyloid-beta+ and 90 amyloid-beta- subjects completed the baseline and 18-month study visits and had valid quantifiable flortaucipir scans at both time points. There was a statistically significant increase in the global estimate of cortical tau burden as measured by standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) from baseline to 18 months in amyloid-beta+ but not amyloid-beta- subjects (least squared mean change in flortaucipir SUVr : 0.0524 +- 0.0085, P < 0.0001 and 0.0007 +- 0.0024 P = 0.7850, respectively), and a significant association between magnitude of SUVr increase and baseline tau burden. Voxel-wise evaluations further suggested that the regional pattern of change in flortaucipir PET SUVr over the 18-month study period (i.e. which regions exhibited the greatest change) also varied as a function of baseline global estimate of tau burden. In subjects with lower global SUVr, temporal lobe regions showed the greatest flortaucipir retention, whereas in subjects with higher baseline SUVr, parietal and frontal regions were increasingly affected. Finally, baseline flortaucipir and change in flortaucipir SUVr were both significantly (P < 0.0001) associated with changes in cognitive performance. Taken together, these results provide a preliminary characterization of the longitudinal spread of tau in Alzheimer's disease and suggest that the amount and location of tau may have implications both for the spread of tau and the cognitive deterioration that may occur over an 18-month period.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal amyloid beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) accumulation is considered an upstream event in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Here we report the mechanism on synaptic activity-independent Abeta1-42 uptake in vivo. When Abeta1-42 uptake was compared in hippocampal slices after incubating with Abeta1-42, In vitro Abeta1-42 uptake was preferentially high in the dentate granule cell layer in the hippocampus. Because the rapid uptake of Abeta1-42 with extracellular Zn2+ is essential for Abeta1-42-induced cognitive decline in vivo, the uptake mechanism was tested in dentate granule cells in association with synaptic activity. In vivo rapid uptake of Abeta1-42 was not modified in the dentate granule cell layer after co-injection of Abeta1-42 and tetrodotoxin, a Na+ channel blocker, into the dentate gyrus. Both the rapid uptake of Abeta1-42 and Zn2+ into the dentate granule cell layer was not modified after co-injection of CNQX, an AMPA receptor antagonist, which blocks extracellular Zn2+ influx, Both the rapid uptake of Abeta1-42 and Zn2+ into the dentate granule cell layer was not also modified after either co-injection of chlorpromazine or genistein, an endocytic repressor. The present study suggests that Abeta1-42 and Zn2+ are synaptic activity-independently co-taken up into dentate granule cells in the normal brain and the co-uptake is preferential in dentate granule cells in the hippocampus. We propose a hypothesis that Zn-Abeta1-42 oligomers formed in the extracellular compartment are directly incorporated into neuronal plasma membranes and form Zn2+-permeable ion channels.",

    "title": "A brief history of \"Alzheimer disease\": Multiple meanings separated by a common name.",
    "abstract": "The field of Alzheimer disease (AD) has a nosologic problem: The diagnostic label \"Alzheimer disease\" has several distinctive meanings. The term probable AD was introduced in 1984 to designate a clinically diagnosed acquired and progressive amnestic dementia for which there was no evidence for another etiology. Probable AD represented a clinicopathologic entity that assumed a specific and sensitive linkage between amnestic dementia and the neuropathology of beta-amyloid-containing neuritic plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. The clinicopathologic model represented by probable AD was adapted in abbreviated form for population-based studies and general clinical practice, although the uncertainty connoted by \"probable\" was often overlooked. Representing the growing public awareness of later life cognitive impairment, a vernacular meaning of AD arose out of the clinicopathologic model in which AD represented all dementia not due to another clinically apparent cause. In contrast, by the 1990s, neuropathologists settled on a definition of AD based entirely on a sufficient burden of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles at postmortem examination, regardless of antemortem clinical status. In the last decade, the availability of fluid and imaging biomarkers that measure beta-amyloid and tau abnormalities has enabled antemortem pathobiological diagnoses, highlighting the divide between the clinicopathologic model, the vernacular usage, and the pathobiological models. Each definition has value. However, the meanings of AD as defined by each of these models are not interchangeable. The pathobiological one is the only one that is unambiguous.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that loneliness increases the risk of AD (Alzheimer's disease) onset, while active and frequent social housing delays the onset of cognitive impairment. The mechanism of how this occurs remains unclear. In this study, we investigated how social interaction affected cognitive function and AD pathology in APP/PS1 (amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1) mice. APP/PS1 mice were divided into either a social isolation (SI) group, a social contact with one mouse (SCO) group, or a social contact with five mice (SCF) group. Our results demonstrated that social housing improved the behavioral performance of APP/PS1 mice in Morris Water Maze testing, without significantly altering the rates of amyloid plaque deposition or amyloidogenic APP processes. Furthermore, the synaptic function, dendritic spine density, and complexity of neuronal network were notably increased in the SCF group, as compared to the SI and SCO groups. Additional protein and mRNA analyses of isolated astrocyte and microglia revealed that several glial genes related to regulation and anti-inflammatory progression were significantly upregulated, while pro-inflammatory markers were decreased. These findings highlight the important role of quality social communication (five mice not one mice) on maintaining neuronal function during AD pathogenesis and provide evidence to place great emphasis of family care of AD patients.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunctions of the vascular system directly contribute to the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The blood-brain barrier (BBB) shows signs of malfunction at early stages of the disease. When Abeta peptide (Abeta) is deposited on brain vessels, it induces vascular degeneration by producing reactive oxygen species and promoting inflammation. These molecular processes are also related to an excessive SSAO/VAP-1 (semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase) enzymatic activity, observed in plasma and in cerebrovascular tissue of AD patients. We studied the contribution of vascular SSAO/VAP-1 to the BBB dysfunction in AD using in vitro BBB models. Our results show that SSAO/VAP-1 expression is associated to endothelial activation by altering the release of pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic angioneurins, most highly IL-6, IL-8 and VEGF. It is also related to a BBB structure alteration, with a decrease in tight-junction proteins such as zona occludens or claudin-5. Moreover, the BBB function reveals increased permeability and leukocyte adhesion in cells expressing SSAO/VAP-1, as well as an enhancement of the vascular Abeta deposition induced by mechanisms both dependent and independent of the enzymatic activity of SSAO/VAP-1. These results reveal an interesting role of vascular SSAO/VAP-1 in BBB dysfunction related to AD progression, opening a new window in the search of alternative therapeutic targets for fighting AD.",

    "abstract": "Aggregates of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide are well known to be the causative substance of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies showed that monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) clusters induce the pathological aggregation of Abeta peptide responsible for the onset and development of AD. However, the effect of GM1-glycan cluster on Abeta conformations has yet to be clarified. Interactions between Abeta peptide and GM1-glycan cluster is important for the earliest stage of the toxic aggregation on GM1 cluster. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Abeta40 on a recently developed artificial GM1-glycan cluster. The artificial GM1-glycan cluster facilitates the characterization of interactions between Abeta40 and multiple GM1-glycans. We succeeded in observing the binding of Abeta40 to the GM1-glycan cluster in all of our MD simulations. Results obtained from these MD simulations indicate the importance of HHQ (13-15) segment of Abeta40 for the GM1-glycan cluster recognition. This result is consistent with previous experimental studies regarding the glycan recognition of Abeta peptide. The recognition mechanism of HHQ (13-15) segment is mainly explained by non-specific stacking interactions between side-chains of histidine and rings of sugar residues, in which the HHQ regime forms coil and bend structures. Moreover, we found that Abeta40 exhibits helix structures at C-terminal side on the GM1-glycan cluster. The helix formation is the initial stage of the pathological aggregation at ceramide moieties of GM1 cluster. The binding of Lys28 to Neu triggers the helix formation at C-terminus side because the formation of a salt bridge between Lys28 and Neu leads to change of intrachain interactions of Abeta40. Our findings suggest that the pathological helix formation of Abeta40 is initiated at GM1-glycan moieties rather than lipid ceramide moieties.",

    "title": "The Molecular Basis for Apolipoprotein E4 as the Major Risk Factor for Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is one of three (E2, E3 and E4) human isoforms of an alpha-helical, 299-amino-acid protein. Homozygosity for the epsilon4 allele is the major genetic risk factor for developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). ApoE2, ApoE3 and ApoE4 differ at amino acid positions 112 and 158, and these sequence variations may confer conformational differences that underlie their participation in the risk of developing AD. Here, we compared the shape, oligomerization state, conformation and stability of ApoE isoforms using a range of complementary biophysical methods including small-angle x-ray scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation, circular dichroism, x-ray fiber diffraction and transmission electron microscopy We provide an in-depth and definitive study demonstrating that all three proteins are similar in stability and conformation. However, we show that ApoE4 has a propensity to polymerize to form wavy filaments, which do not share the characteristics of cross-beta amyloid fibrils. Moreover, we provide evidence for the inhibition of ApoE4 fibril formation by ApoE3. This study shows that recombinant ApoE isoforms show no significant differences at the structural or conformational level. However, self-assembly of the ApoE4 isoform may play a role in pathogenesis, and these results open opportunities for uncovering new triggers for AD onset.",

Recent improvements in technologies to assess plasma levels of amyloid beta indicate that a single sample of blood could provide an accurate estimate of brain amyloid positivity. Plasma neurofilament light protein appears to provide a good marker of neurodegeneration, although not specific for AD. Plasma tau shows some promising results but weak or no correlation with CSF tau levels, which may reflect rapid clearance of tau in the bloodstream.

The possibility of quantitative determination of isoAsp7 in Abeta(1-42) with the detection limit as low as 2 pmol has been demonstrated. The same approach was applied for a shorter peptide Abeta(1-16) and resulted in enhanced accuracy (+- 3.2%), and lower detection limit (50 fmol). Pilot experiments with artificial cerebrospinal fluid and mouse brain tissue were performed and showed that the proposed IP-MALDI-TOF/TOF approach could be applied for measuring isoAbeta content in biological fluids and tissues.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In vivo detection of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now possible with 11 C-PiB positron emission tomography (PET). Conventionally, a cortical:cerebellar PiB uptake ratio threshold of 1.4-1.5 has been used to categorize at-risk subjects as \"amyloid-positive\" and \"amyloid-negative.\" It has been suggested that this threshold is too conservative and may miss early amyloid pathology. We investigated the relationship between conventional and lower baseline 11 C-PiB PET thresholds for raised amyloid load and the subsequent clinical and radiological progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cases longitudinally. METHODS: We serially determined the cortical amyloid load with 11 C-PiB PET of 44 MCI subjects over 2 years and compared findings with those for 12 healthy controls (HC) and 5 AD cases. RESULTS: Twenty-four subjects were classified as normal at baseline with mean cortical PiB standard uptake value ratios (SUVR) between 1.2 and 1.5. Their cognitive status remained stable over time. Three of these cases increased their amyloid load above a threshold of 1.5 over 2 years. Twenty-seven \"raised amyloid\" MCI cases with baseline cortical SUVRs above 1.5, showed deteriorating cognition. Note that 50% of these cases converted clinically to AD during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Use of a PiB SUVR threshold of >1.5 for raised amyloid missed 14.3% of MCI cases who likely had Thal stage 1 or 2 pathology and showed a progressive amyloid increase over 2 years. Lowering the threshold for abnormality to 1.3 abolished all false negatives but resulted in 75% of HCs being falsely diagnosed as raised amyloid subjects.",

    "title": "Tau covariance patterns in Alzheimer's disease patients match intrinsic connectivity networks in the healthy brain.",
    "abstract": "According to the network model of neurodegeneration, the spread of pathogenic proteins occurs selectively along connected brain regions. We tested in vivo whether the distribution of filamentous tau (measured with [18F]flortaucipir-PET), fibrillar amyloid-beta ([11C]PIB-PET) and glucose hypometabolism ([18F]FDG-PET) follows the intrinsic functional organization of the healthy brain. We included 63 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD; 30 male, 63 +- 8 years) who underwent [18F]flortaucipir, [11C]PIB and [18F]FDG PET, and 1000 young adults (427 male, 21 +- 3 years) who underwent task-free fMRI. We selected six predefined disease epicenters as seeds for whole-brain voxelwise covariance analyses to compare correlated patterns of tracer uptake across AD patients against fMRI intrinsic connectivity patterns in young adults. We found a striking convergence between [18F]flortaucipir covariance patterns and intrinsic connectivity maps (range Spearman rho's: 0.32-0.78, p < .001), which corresponded with expected functional networks (range goodness-of-fit: 3.8-8.2). The topography of amyloid-beta covariance patterns was more diffuse and less network-specific, while glucose hypometabolic patterns were more spatially restricted than tau but overlapped with functional networks. These findings suggest that the spatial patterns of tau and glucose hypometabolism observed in AD resemble the functional organization of the healthy brain, supporting the notion that tau pathology spreads through circumscribed brain networks and drives neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Prion diseases are neurodegenerative disorders caused by misfolding of the prion protein (PrP) from a normal cellular protein (PrPC) to a protease-resistant isoform (PrPSc). However, the aggregation mechanism is not entirely understood because of the physical properties of PrP, such as its solubility or aggregation in vitro and conformational or mutation diversity. Recently, we reported the physical and physiological properties of a synthetic fragment peptide. In the present study, we assessed the importance of a point mutation at the C-terminal region of PrP in structural conversion and aggregation and evaluated the physical and physiological properties of the point-mutated human-PrP180-192 V180I (hPrP180-192 V180I) using circular dichroism spectra, high-performance liquid chromatography, Affinix QNmu, and thioflavin-T staining, including the effects of Cu2+. The secondary structure of hPrP180-192 V180I changed from a random coil to a beta-sheet in Cu2+ free buffer. In addition, we observed molecular interactions in hPrP180-192 V180I and aggregation with itself, which were inhibited by Cu2+. We conclude that the point mutation in the C-terminal region of PrP, including hPrP180-192 V180I, and Cu2+ may play an important role in the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles and characterized by neurodegeneration and memory loss. The majority of AD patients also have Abeta deposition in cerebral vessels known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), microhemorrhages, and vascular co-morbidities, suggesting that cerebrovascular dysfunction contributes to AD etiology. Promoting cerebrovascular resilience may therefore be a promising therapeutic or preventative strategy for AD. Plasma high-density lipoproteins (HDL) have several vasoprotective functions and are associated with reduced AD risk in some epidemiological studies and with reduced Abeta deposition and Abeta-induced inflammation in 3D engineered human cerebral vessels. In mice, deficiency of apoA-I, the primary protein component of HDL, increases CAA and cognitive dysfunction, whereas overexpression of apoA-I from its native promoter in liver and intestine has the opposite effect and lessens neuroinflammation. Similarly, acute peripheral administration of HDL reduces soluble Abeta pools in the brain and some studies have observed reduced CAA as well. Here, we expand upon the known effects of plasma HDL in mouse models and in vitro 3D artery models to investigate the interaction of amyloid, astrocytes, and HDL on the cerebrovasculature in APP/PS1 mice. METHODS: APP/PS1 mice deficient or hemizygous for Apoa1 were aged to 12 months. Plasma lipids, amyloid plaque deposition, Abeta protein levels, protein and mRNA markers of neuroinflammation, and astrogliosis were assessed using ELISA, qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence. Contextual and cued fear conditioning were used to assess behavior. RESULTS: In APP/PS1 mice, complete apoA-I deficiency increased total and vascular Abeta deposition in the cortex but not the hippocampus compared to APP/PS1 littermate controls hemizygous for apoA-I. Markers of both general and vascular neuroinflammation, including Il1b mRNA, ICAM-1 protein, PDGFRbeta protein, and GFAP protein, were elevated in apoA-I-deficient APP/PS1 mice. Additionally, apoA-I-deficient APP/PS1 mice had elevated levels of vascular-associated ICAM-1 in the cortex and hippocampus and vascular-associated GFAP in the cortex. A striking observation was that astrocytes associated with cerebral vessels laden with Abeta or associated with Abeta plaques showed increased reactivity in APP/PS1 mice lacking apoA-I. No behavioral changes were observed. CONCLUSIONS: ApoA-I-containing HDL can reduce amyloid pathology and astrocyte reactivity to parenchymal and vascular amyloid in APP/PS1 mice.",

Dentate gyrus LTP was attenuated after injection of human Abeta1-40 and rat Abeta1-42 (25 pmol, 1 mul) into the dentate gyrus, which did not increase intracellular Zn2+ in the dentate gyrus. The attenuated LTP was not rescued by co-injection of CaEDTA, an extracellular Zn2+ chelator. The present study suggests that human Abeta1-40 and rat Abeta1-42 affect cognitive activity via extracellular Zn2+-independent mechanism at low micromolar concentration.",

    "abstract": "An aged circulatory environment can activate microglia, reduce neural precursor cell activity and impair cognition in mice. We hypothesized that brain endothelial cells (BECs) mediate at least some of these effects. We observe that BECs in the aged mouse hippocampus express an inflammatory transcriptional profile with focal upregulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), a protein that facilitates vascular-immune cell interactions. Concomitantly, levels of the shed, soluble form of VCAM1 are prominently increased in the plasma of aged humans and mice, and their plasma is sufficient to increase VCAM1 expression in cultured BECs and the hippocampi of young mice. Systemic administration of anti-VCAM1 antibody or genetic ablation of Vcam1 in BECs counteracts the detrimental effects of plasma from aged individuals on young brains and reverses aging aspects, including microglial reactivity and cognitive deficits, in the brains of aged mice. Together, these findings establish brain endothelial VCAM1 at the blood-brain barrier as a possible target to treat age-related neurodegeneration.",

However, the underlying mechanism by which silibinin improves cognition remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of silibinin on beta-secretase levels, Abeta enzymatic degradation, and oxidative stress in the brains of APP/PS1 mice with cognitive impairments. Oral administration of silibinin for 2 months significantly attenuated the cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 mice in the Y-maze test, novel object recognition test, and Morris water maze test. Biochemical analyses revealed that silibinin decreased Abeta deposition and the levels of soluble Abeta1-40/1-42 in the hippocampus by downregulating APP and BACE1 and upregulating NEP in APP/PS1 mice. In addition, silibinin decreased the MDA content and increased the activities of the antioxidant enzymes CAT, SOD, and NO.

In particular, we utilized a rotating frame (R1rho ) and the newly developed time domain quadrupolar Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (QCPMG) relaxation measurements at the selectively deuterated side chains of A2, H6, and G9. The two experiments are complementary in terms of probing somewhat different timescales of motions, governed by the tensor parameters and the sampling window of the magnetization decay curves. The results indicated two mobile \"free\" states of the N-terminal domain undergoing global diffusive motions, with isotropic diffusion coefficients of 0.7-1   108 and 0.3-3   106 ad2  s-1 . The free states are also involved in the conformational exchange with a single bound state, in which the diffusive motions are quenched, likely due to transient interactions with the structured hydrophobic core. The conformational exchange rate constants are 2-3   105  s-1 and 2-3   104  s-1 for the fast and slow diffusion free states, respectively.",

Therefore, in this study, we used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to clarify the impact of cell membrane cholesterol on the interaction of Abeta with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) as a membrane model. Moreover, the effect of the P7C3-S243 molecule on the abovementioned process was investigated. The simulation results disclosed the neuroprotective property of the P7C3-S243 molecule. The MD simulation results indicate that the interaction of cholesterol molecules with the Abeta oligomer is negligible and cannot enhance membrane rupture. However, strong hydrogen bonding between the POPC molecules and the oligomers led to membrane perturbation. According to our modellings, the P7C3-S243 molecular layer can protect the cell membrane by inhibiting the direct interaction between the bilayer and Abeta. In addition, free-energy calculations were conducted to determine the possible penetration of Abeta fibrils into the cholesterol-enriched membrane.",

    "abstract": "Studies have found strong correlations between polymorphism and structural variations in amyloid-beta (Abeta) fibrils and the diverse clinical subtypes of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, a detailed understanding of the conformational behavior of Abeta fibrils may be an aid to elucidate the pathological mechanisms involved in AD. However, a key point that has been inadvertently underestimated or dismissed is the role of the protonated state at the C-terminal residue of amyloid-beta peptides, which can give rise to intrinsic differences in the morphology and stability of the fibrils. For instance, the effects of the salt bridge formed between the C-terminal residue A42 and the residue K28 on the S-shaped Abeta protofibril structure remain unknown and may be different from those in the U-shaped Abeta protofibril structures. To address this effect, we explore the stability of the S-shaped protofibrils capped with different C-terminal modifications, including carboxyl group in its deprotonated (COO-) and protonated (COOH) states, by using molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings indicated that the C-terminal deprotonated protofibril is significantly more stable than its C-terminal protonated counterpart due to a well-defined and highly stable zipper-like salt-bridge-chain formed by the epsilon-NH3 + groups on the sidechain of residue K28 and the C-terminal COO- group at the A42 residue. The revealed underlying molecular mechanism for the different stability of the protofibrils provides insights into the diversity of polymorphism in Abeta fibrils.",

Using automated segmentation of stained objects and a cloud-based interface, we annotate > 70,000 plaque candidates from 43 whole slide images (WSIs) to train and evaluate convolutional neural networks. Networks achieve strong plaque classification on a 10-WSI hold-out set (0.993 and 0.743 areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curve, respectively). Prediction confidence maps visualize morphology distributions at high resolution. Resulting network-derived amyloid beta (Abeta)-burden scores correlate well with established semi-quantitative scores on a 30-WSI blinded hold-out. Finally, saliency mapping demonstrates that networks learn patterns agreeing with accepted pathologic features.

To date, amyloidoses are roughly classified, owing to their tremendous heterogeneity. In this work, we introduce AmyCo, a freely available collection of amyloidoses and clinical disorders related to amyloid deposition. AmyCo classifies 75 diseases associated with amyloid deposition into two distinct categories, namely 1) amyloidosis and 2) clinical conditions associated with amyloidosis. Each database entry is annotated with the major protein component (causative protein), other components of amyloid deposits and affected tissues or organs. Database entries are also supplemented with appropriate detailed annotation and are referenced to ICD-10, MeSH, OMIM, PubMed, AmyPro and UniProtKB databases.

Abeta is derived by sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Alterations in the subcellular targeting of APP are thought to affect the degree of Abeta production. Sorting receptors, such as SorLA, convey subcellular targeting of APP. Dysfunction of SorLA, and likely of the related receptors SorCS1 and SorCS3, cause AD. Nevertheless, disease progression could also provoke altered expression of the receptors. Here, we assessed if Abeta plaque formation promotes altered expression of SorLA, SorCS1 and SorCS3. We analyzed transcript levels during aging and after amyloidosis in brain areas characterized by early amyloid plaque formation in an AD mouse model (APPPS1) and wild types. We observed stable expression levels during aging (1-12 months). After plaque formation, SorCS1 and SorLA expression were markedly reduced in the frontal cerebral cortex and to a minor extent in the hippocampus, whereas SorCS3 expression was solely reduced in the frontal cerebral cortex. Our results indicate that disease progression, associated with Abeta accumulation, can negatively regulate expression of the receptors.",

We now show that in an independent, aggressive APPSWE/PS1L166P (APPPS1-21) mouse model of Abeta amyloidosis, an ABX-perturbed gut microbiome is associated with a reduction in Abeta pathology and alterations in microglial morphology, thus establishing the generality of the phenomenon. Most importantly, these latter alterations occur only in brains of male mice, not in the brains of female mice. Furthermore, ABX treatment lead to alterations in levels of selected microglial expressed transcripts indicative of the \"M0\" homeostatic state in male but not in female mice. Finally, we found that transplants of fecal microbiota from age-matched APPPS1-21 male mice into ABX-treated APPPS1-21 male restores the gut microbiome and partially restores Abeta pathology and microglial morphology, thus demonstrating a causal role of the microbiome in the modulation of Abeta amyloidosis and microglial physiology in mouse models of Abeta amyloidosis.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurogranin concentrations are altered in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), comparatively with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and associated with neuronal degeneration in brain tissue. METHODS: CSF neurogranin, total tau, neurofilament light (NFL) and 14-3-3 protein were measured in neurological controls (NCs, n=64), AD (n=46) and CJD (n=81). The accuracy of neurogranin discriminating the three diagnostic groups was evaluated. Correlations between neurogranin and neurodegeneration biomarkers, demographic, genetic and clinical data were assessed. Additionally, neurogranin expression in postmortem brain tissue was studied. RESULTS: Compared with NC, CSF neurogranin concentrations were increased in CJD (4.75 times of NC; p<0.001, area under curve (AUC), 0.96 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.99) and AD (1.94 times of NC; p<0.01, AUC 0.73, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.82), and were able to differentiate CJD from AD (p<0.001, AUC 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.92). CSF tau was increased in CJD (41 times of NC) and in AD (3.1 times of NC), both at p<0.001. In CJD, neurogranin positively correlated with tau (r=0.55, p<0.001) and was higher in 14-3-3-positivity (p<0.05), but showed no association with NFL (r=0.08, p=0.46). CJD-MM1/MV1 cases displayed higher neurogranin levels than VV2 cases. Neurogranin was increased at early CJD disease stages and was a good prognostic marker of survival time in CJD. In brain tissue, neurogranin was detected in the cytoplasm, membrane and postsynaptic density fractions of neurons, with reduced levels in AD, and more significantly in CJD, where they correlated with synaptic and axonal markers. CONCLUSIONS: Neurogranin is a new biomarker of prion pathogenesis with diagnostic and prognostic abilities, which reflects the degree of neuronal damage in brain tissue in a CJD subtype manner.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) that leads to the formation of plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurs through the stepwise formation of oligomers and fibrils. An earlier onset of aggregation is obtained upon intracerebral injection of Abeta-containing brain homogenate into human APP transgenic mice that follows a prion-like seeding mechanism. Immunoprecipitation of these brain extracts with anti-Abeta oligomer antibodies or passive immunization of the recipient animals abrogated the observed seeding activity, although induced Abeta deposition was still evident. Here, we establish that, together with Abeta monomers, Abeta oligomers trigger the initial phase of Abeta seeding and that the depletion of oligomeric Abeta delays the aggregation process, leading to a transient reduction of seed-induced Abeta deposits. This work extends the current knowledge about the role of Abeta oligomers beyond its cytotoxic nature by pointing to a role in the initiation of Abeta aggregation in vivo. We conclude that Abeta oligomers are important for the early initiation phase of the seeding process.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is related with the abnormal aggregation of amyloid beta-peptides Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42, the latter having a polymorphic character which gives rise to U- or S-shaped fibrils. Elucidating the role played by the nanoscale-material architecture on the amyloid fibril stability is a crucial breakthrough to better understand the pathological nature of amyloid structures and to support the rational design of bio-inspired materials. The computational study here presented highlights the superior mechanical behavior of the S-architecture, characterized by a Young's modulus markedly higher than the U-shaped architecture. The S-architecture showed a higher mechanical resistance to the enforced deformation along the fibril axis, consequence of a better interchain hydrogen bonds' distribution. In conclusion, this study, focusing the attention on the pivotal multiscale relationship between molecular phenomena and material properties, suggests the S-shaped Abeta1-42 species as a target of election in computational screen/design/optimization of effective aggregation modulators.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E (apoE) colocalizes with amyloid-beta (Abeta) in Alzheimer disease (AD) plaques and in synapses, and evidence suggests that direct interactions between apoE and Abeta are important for apoE's effects in AD. The present work examines the hypothesis that apoE receptors mediate uptake of apoE/Abeta complex into synaptic terminals. Western blot analysis shows multiple SDS-stable assemblies in synaptosomes from human AD cortex; apoE/Abeta complex was markedly increased in AD compared with aged control samples. Complex formation between apoE and Abeta was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The apoE receptors low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and LDLR-related protein 1 (LRP1) were quantified in synaptosomes using flow cytometry, revealing up-regulation of LRP1 in early- and late-stage AD. Dual-labeling flow cytometry analysis of LRP1- and LDLR positives indicate most (approximately 65%) of LDLR and LRP1 is associated with postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95)-positive synaptosomes, indicating that remaining LRP1 and LDLR receptors are exclusively presynaptic. Flow cytometry analysis of Nile red labeling revealed a reduction in cholesterol esters in AD synaptosomes. Dual-labeling experiments showed apoE and Abeta concentration into LDLR and LRP1-positive synaptosomes, along with free and esterified cholesterol. Synaptic Abeta was increased by apoE4 in control and AD samples. These results are consistent with uptake of apoE/Abeta complex and associated lipids into synaptic terminals, with subsequent Abeta clearance in control synapses and accumulation in AD synapses.",

Here, we provide evidence that altered BACE1 levels and activity impact the degradation of Abeta40 and Abeta42 into a common Abeta34 intermediate. Using human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort, we show that Abeta34 is elevated in individuals with mild cognitive impairment who later progressed to dementia. Furthermore, Abeta34 levels correlate with the overall Abeta clearance rates in amyloid positive individuals. Using CSF samples from the PREVENT-AD cohort (cognitively normal individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease), we further demonstrate that the Abeta34/Abeta42 ratio, representing Abeta degradation and cortical deposition, associates with pre-clinical markers of neurodegeneration. We propose that Abeta34 represents a marker of amyloid clearance and may be helpful for the characterization of Abeta turnover in clinical samples.",

METHODS: We investigated whether plasma concentrations of the Abeta1-40/Abeta1-42 ratio, assessed using the single-molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay, may predict brain Abeta positron emission tomography status in a large-scale longitudinal monocentric cohort (N = 276) of older individuals with subjective memory complaints. We performed a hypothesis-driven investigation followed by a no-a-priori hypothesis study using machine learning. RESULTS: The receiver operating characteristic curve and machine learning showed a balanced accuracy of 76.5% and 81%, respectively, for the plasma Abeta1-40/Abeta1-42 ratio. The accuracy is not affected by the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele, sex, or age.

We modified the yeast Gal4 transcription system to study the nuclear translocation of transcriptionally active complexes using the fluorescent protein citrine (Cit) as a reporter. This enabled highly sensitive quantitative analysis of transcription in situ at the single cell level. The Gal4/UAS-Cit transcription assay displayed a sigmoidal response limited by the number of integrated reporter cassettes. We validated the assay by analyzing nuclear translocation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD) and confirmed the requirement of Fe65 for nuclear translocation of AICD. In addition to the strong on-off effects on transcriptional activity, the results of this assay establish that phosphorylation modifies nuclear signaling. The Y682F mutation in APP showed the strongest increase in Cit expression, underscoring its role in regulating Fe65 binding. Together, we established a highly sensitive fluorescent protein-based assay that can monitor transcriptional activity at the single cell level and demonstrate that AICD phosphorylation affects Fe65 nuclear activity. This assay also introduces a platform for future single cell-based drug screening methods for nuclear translocation.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Leukemia inhibitory factor, a novel myokine, is known to be associated with neural function, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. METHODS: HT-22 mouse hippocampal cells, primary hippocampal cells, and Drosophila Alzheimer's disease model were used to determine the effect of leukemia inhibitory factor on neurons. Immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence method were used to analyze biological mechanism. RESULTS: Leukemia inhibitory factor increased Akt phosphorylation in a phosphoinositide-3-kinase-dependent manner in hippocampal cells. Leukemia inhibitory factor also increased the phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin and the downstream S6K. Leukemia inhibitory factor stimulated the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription via extracellular signal-regulated kinases. Leukemia inhibitory factor increased c-fos expression through both Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinases. Leukemia inhibitory factor blocked amyloid beta-induced neural viability suppression and inhibited amyloid beta-induced glucose uptake impairment through the block of amyloid beta-mediated insulin receptor downregulation. Leukemia inhibitory factor blocked amyloid beta-mediated induction of the autophagy marker, microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3. Additionally, in primary prepared hippocampal cells, leukemia inhibitory factor stimulated Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, demonstrating that leukemia inhibitory factor has physiological relevance in vivo. Suppression of the autophagy marker, light chain 3II, by leukemia inhibitory factor was observed in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that leukemia inhibitory factor protects against amyloid beta-induced neurotoxicity via Akt/extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mediated c-fos induction, and thus suggest that leukemia inhibitory factor is a potential drug for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Failure of anti-amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) therapies against Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by high amounts of the peptide in the brain, raised the question of the physiological role of Abeta released at low concentrations in the healthy brain. To address this question, we studied the presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms underlying the neuromodulatory action of picomolar amounts of oligomeric Abeta42 (oAbeta42) on synaptic glutamatergic function in male and female mice. We found that 200 pm oAbeta42 induces an increase of frequency of miniature EPSCs and a decrease of paired pulse facilitation, associated with an increase in docked vesicle number, indicating that it augments neurotransmitter release at presynaptic level. oAbeta42 also produced postsynaptic changes as shown by an increased length of postsynaptic density, accompanied by an increased expression of plasticity-related proteins such as cAMP-responsive element binding protein phosphorylated at Ser133, calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II phosphorylated at Thr286, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, suggesting a role for Abeta in synaptic tagging. These changes resulted in the conversion of early into late long-term potentiation through the nitric oxide/cGMP/protein kinase G intracellular cascade consistent with a cGMP-dependent switch from short- to long-term memory observed in vivo after intrahippocampal administration of picomolar amounts of oAbeta42 These effects were present upon extracellular but not intracellular application of the peptide and involved alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These observations clarified the physiological role of oAbeta42 in synaptic function and memory formation providing solid fundamentals for investigating the pathological effects of high Abeta levels in the AD brains.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT High levels of oligomeric amyloid-beta42 (oAbeta42) induce synaptic dysfunction leading to memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, at picomolar concentrations, the peptide is needed to ensure long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory. Here, we show that extracellular 200 pm oAbeta42 concentrations increase neurotransmitter release, number of docked vesicles, postsynaptic density length, and expression of plasticity-related proteins leading to the conversion of early LTP into late LTP and of short-term memory into long-term memory. These effects require alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and are mediated through the nitric oxide/cGMP/protein kinase G pathway. The knowledge of Abeta function in the healthy brain might be useful to understand the causes leading to its increase and detrimental effect in AD.",

In this article, we explore how commonalities and differences in connectome alterations can reveal relationships across disorders. We survey recent literature on connectivity changes in neurological and psychiatric disorders in the context of key organizational principles of the human connectome and observe that several disturbances to network properties of the human brain have a common role in a wide range of brain disorders and point towards potentially shared network mechanisms underpinning disorders. We hypothesize that the distinct dimensions along which connectome networks are organized (for example, 'modularity' and 'integration') provide a general coordinate system that allows description and categorization of relationships between seemingly disparate disorders. We outline a cross-disorder 'connectome landscape of dysconnectivity' along these principal dimensions of network organization that may place shared connectome alterations between brain disorders in a common framework.",

In our study, we sought to determine the impact of APOE genotype on cross-sectional and longitudinal florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid measures and its impact in classification of patients and interpretation of clinical cohort results. We included 1,019 and 1,072 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants with cerebrospinal fluid Abeta1 - 42 and florbetapir PET values, respectively. 623 of these subjects had a second florbetapir PET scans two years after the baseline visit. We evaluated the effect of APOE genotype on Abeta distribution pattern, pathological biomarker cut-points, cross-sectional clinical associations with Abeta load, and longitudinal Abeta deposition rate measured using florbetapir PET scans. 1) APOEe4 genotype influences brain amyloid deposition pattern; 2) APOEe4 genotype does not modify Abeta biomarker cut-points estimated using unsupervised mixture modeling methods if white matter and brainstem references are used (but not when cerebellum is used as a reference); 3) findings of large differences in Abeta biomarker value differences based on APOE genotype are due to increased probability of having AD neuropathology and are most significant in mild cognitive impairment subjects; and 4) APOE genotype and age (but not gender) were associated with increased Abeta deposition rate. APOEe4 carrier status affects rate and location of brain Abeta deposition but does not affect choice of biomarker cut-points if adequate references are selected for florbetapir PET processing.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta (1-42; Abeta42), can provide high diagnostic accuracy. Several immunoassays are available for Abeta42 quantitation, but standardisation across assays remains an issue. We compared the Elecsys  beta-Amyloid (1-42) CSF assay with three assays and two liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods. METHODS: Three method comparison studies evaluated the correlation between the Elecsys  beta-Amyloid (1-42) CSF assay versus: INNOTEST  beta-AMYLOID(1-42) (860 samples) and the Roche Diagnostics-developed LC-MS/MS method (250 samples); INNO-BIA AlzBio3 and the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn)-developed LC-MS/MS method (250 samples); and ADx-EUROIMMUN Beta-Amyloid (1-42) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (49 samples). RESULTS: High correlation was demonstrated between Elecsys  beta-Amyloid (1-42) CSF and comparator assays: INNOTEST  beta-AMYLOID(1-42) (Spearman's rho, 0.954); INNO-BIA AlzBio3 (Spearman's rho, 0.864); ADx-EUROIMMUN Beta-Amyloid (1-42) ELISA (Pearson's r, 0.925). Elecsys  assay and LC-MS/MS measurements were highly correlated: Pearson's r, 0.949 (Roche Diagnostics-developed method) and 0.943 (UPenn-developed method). CONCLUSION: Findings from this multicentre evaluation further support use of the Elecsys  beta-Amyloid (1-42) CSF assay to aid AD diagnosis. CSF-based certified reference materials should improve agreement across assays and mass spectrometry-based methods, which is essential to establish a global uniform CSF Abeta42 cut-off to detect amyloid pathology.",

The role of PLCG2 in immune system signaling suggests it may also protect against other neurodegenerative diseases and possibly associates with longevity. We studied the effect of the rs72824905-G on seven neurodegenerative diseases and longevity, using 53,627 patients, 3,516 long-lived individuals and 149,290 study-matched controls. We replicated the association of rs72824905-G with reduced AD risk and we found an association with reduced risk of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We did not find evidence for an effect on Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS) risks, despite adequate sample sizes. Conversely, the rs72824905-G allele was associated with increased likelihood of longevity. By-proxy analyses in the UK Biobank supported the associations with both dementia and longevity.

The susceptibility to aggregation of protein molecules is dealt with by proteostasis in living systems, in which molecular chaperones play an important role. Recently, several secreted proteins have been examined as extracellular chaperones with a potency to suppress the formation of amyloid fibrils, although the whole picture that includes their inhibition mechanisms is not yet understood. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of fibrinogen (Fg), one of the extracellular proteins identified as a potential member of the group of chaperones, on fibril formation. Insulin B chain was used as an amyloid formation model system because its prefibrillar intermediate species in the nucleation phase were well characterized. We revealed that Fg efficiently inhibited amyloid fibril formation via a direct interaction with the surface of the prefibrillar intermediates. Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments and a stoichiometry analysis suggested a structural model in which the surface of the rod-shaped prefibrillar intermediates is surrounded by Fg molecules. From such a specific manner of interactions, we propose that the role of Fg is to disturb fibril growth by confining the nuclei even when the nucleation occurs inside the prefibrillar intermediate. The structural property of the B-chain intermediates complexed with Fg would provide insights into the general principles of the functions of chaperones and other potential chaperone-like proteins involved in amyloid-related diseases.",

    "title": "Association of Early-Onset Alzheimer Disease With Elevated Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Levels and Rare Genetic Coding Variants of APOB.",
    "abstract": "Importance: Early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) is a rare form of Alzheimer disease (AD) with a large genetic basis that is only partially understood. In late-onset AD, elevated circulating cholesterol levels increase AD risk even after adjusting for the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE E4) allele, a major genetic factor for AD and elevated cholesterol levels; however, the role of circulating cholesterol levels in EOAD is unclear. Objectives: To investigate the association between circulating cholesterol levels and EOAD and to identify genetic variants underlying this possible association. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case series, plasma cholesterol levels were directly measured in 267 samples from the AD research centers (ADRCs) of Emory University and University of California, San Francisco, collected from January 21, 2009, through August 21, 2014. The association between cholesterol and EOAD was examined using multiple linear regression. To determine the underlying genetic variants, APOB, APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 were sequenced in samples from 2125 EOAD cases and controls recruited from 29 ADRCs from January 1, 1984, through December 31, 2015. Data were analyzed from November 23, 2016, through April 10, 2018. Exposures: Clinical diagnosis, age at clinical diagnosis, plasma cholesterol measures (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B), and genetic variants in APOE, APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, and APOB. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the association between EOAD and plasma cholesterol measures. The secondary outcome was the association between EOAD and the burden of genetic variants in APOB. Results: Of the 2125 samples that underwent genetic sequencing, 1276 were from women (60.0%) and 654 (30.8%) were from patients with EOAD (mean [SD] ages, 55.6 [4.3] years for cases and 72.0 [9.6] years for controls). APOE E4 explained 10.1% of the variance of EOAD. After controlling for APOE E4, EOAD cases had higher levels of total cholesterol (mean difference [SE], 21.9 [5.2] mg/dL; P = 2.9 x 10-5), LDL-C (mean difference [SE], 22.0 [4.5] mg/dL; P = 1.8 x 10-6), and ApoB (mean difference [SE], 12.0 [2.4] mg/dL; P = 2.0 x 10-6) than controls in 267 frozen samples. Approximately 3% of EOAD cases carried known AD-causing mutations. Gene-based rare variant burden testing in 2066 samples showed that rare APOB coding variants were significantly more abundant in EOAD cases after adjusting for sex, APOE E4, genetic principal components, ADRC center, and batch (effect size, 0.20; P = 4.20 x 10-4). Conclusions and Relevance: Elevated LDL-C levels were associated with higher probability of having EOAD, and EOAD cases were enriched for rare coding variants in APOB, which codes for the major protein of LDL-C. Collectively, these novel findings highlight the important role of LDL-C in EOAD pathogenesis and suggest a direct link of APOB variants to AD risk.",

Therefore, the inhibition of Abeta aggregation is a potential therapeutic approach for AD. Herein, twenty-seven biflavonoids with different inter-flavonyl linkages and methoxy substitution patterns were isolated from several plants, and their Abeta40 aggregation inhibitory activity was evaluated by the thioflavin-T fluorescence assay. Amentoflavone (1) and its monomethoxy derivatives (2, 3, and 5) exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity, with IC50 values of approximately 5 muM. It was clarified that increasing the number of methoxy substituents on the biflavonoid structures attenuated the inhibitory activity. Moreover, the linkage and the methoxy substitution pattern had a marked influence on the inhibitory activity. Our investigation strongly supports that biflavonoids can be considered a new type of anti-Alzheimer agents that may be successfully developed for AD patients.",

    "abstract": "Compelling evidence implicates self-assembly of amyloid-beta (Abeta 1-42) peptides into soluble oligomers and fibrils as a major underlying event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Herein, we employed amyloid-degrading keratinase (kerA) enzyme as a key Abeta 1-42-binding scaffold to identify five keratinase-guided peptides (KgPs) capable of interacting with and altering amyloidogenic conversion of Abeta 1-42 The KgPs showed micromolar affinities with Abeta 1-42 and abolished its sigmoidal amyloidogenic transition, resulting in abrogation of fibrillogenesis. Comprehensive assessment using dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed that KgPs induced the formation of off-pathway oligomers comparatively larger than the native Abeta 1-42 oligomers but with a significantly reduced cross-beta signature. These off-pathway oligomers exhibited low immunoreactivity against oligomer-specific (A11) and fibril-specific (OC) antibodies and rescued neuronal cells from Abeta 1-42 oligomer toxicity as well as neuronal apoptosis. Structural analysis using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed two preferred KgP binding sites (Lys16-Phe20 and Leu28-Val39) on the NMR ensembles of monomeric and fibrillar Abeta 1-42, indicating an interruption of crucial hydrophobic and aromatic interactions. Overall, our results demonstrate a new approach for designing potential anti-amyloid molecules that could pave way for developing effective therapeutics against AD and other amyloid diseases.",

    "abstract": "With increasing age, the general population is increasingly vulnerable to the development of cerebral amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque and neuronal phospho-tau (p-tau) pathology. In HIV disease, prior studies of these neuropathologic changes were relatively limited. Here, we characterized Abeta plaques and p-tau lesions by immunohistochemistry in relevant brain regions (prefrontal neocortex, putamen, basal-temporal neocortex, and hippocampus) of HIV-infected adults. We used multivariable logistic regression to predict regional Abeta plaque or p-tau pathology based on demographic factors, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes, HIV disease-related factors, and regional gliosis. We used multiple linear regression to predict T-scores in neuropsychological domains based on regional Abeta plaque or p-tau pathology. We found that APOE epsilon4 alleles, older age, and higher plasma HIV-1 RNA predicted prefrontal Abeta plaques (odds ratio (OR) 5.306, 1.045, and 0.699, respectively, n = 168). Older age predicted putamen Abeta plaques (OR 1.064, n = 171). APOE epsilon4 alleles, hepatitis C virus seropositivity, and higher plasma HIV-1 RNA predicted hippocampus Abeta plaques (OR 6.779, 6.138, and 0.589, respectively, n = 56). The p-tau lesions were sparse in the vast majority of affected cases. Lifetime substance use disorder and higher plasma HIV-1 RNA predicted putamen p-tau lesions (OR 0.278 and 0.638, respectively, n = 67). Older age and gliosis predicted hippocampus p-tau lesions (OR 1.128 and 0.592, respectively, n = 59). Prefrontal Abeta plaques predicted lower speed of information processing (n = 159) and putamen Abeta plaques predicted lower levels of attention and working memory (n = 88). Regional p-tau lesions were not significantly predictive of any neuropsychological domains. In conclusion, Abeta plaque or p-tau pathology in different brain regions was predicted by different sets of biological factors. Abeta plaques in prefrontal neocortex and putamen predicted poorer functioning in cognitive domains relevant to these brain regions. The absence of significant impact of regional p-tau lesions on neuropsychological functioning might be explained by the subthreshold burden of p-tau lesions.",

Mouse models relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD) have largely been developed using these classical laboratory strains, such as C57BL/6J (B6), and this has likely contributed to the failure of translation of findings from mice to the clinic. Therefore, here we test the potential for natural genetic variation to enhance the translatability of AD mouse models. Two widely used AD-relevant transgenes, APPswe and PS1de9 (APP/PS1), were backcrossed from B6 to three wild-derived strains CAST/EiJ, WSB/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, representative of three Mus musculus subspecies. These new AD strains were characterized using metabolic, functional, neuropathological and transcriptional assays. Strain-, sex- and genotype-specific differences were observed in cognitive ability, neurodegeneration, plaque load, cerebrovascular health and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Analyses of brain transcriptional data showed strain was the greatest driver of variation. We identified significant variation in myeloid cell numbers in wild type mice of different strains as well as significant differences in plaque-associated myeloid responses in APP/PS1 mice between the strains. Collectively, these data support the use of wild-derived strains to better model the complexity of human AD.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) and tau in the brain is a major pathological change related to Alzheimer's disease. We have continued to develop Extracorporeal Blood Abeta Removal Systems (E-BARS) as a method for enhancing Abeta clearance from the brain. Our previous report revealed that dialyzers effectively remove blood Abeta and evoke large Abeta influxes into the blood, resulting in a decrease in brain Abeta accumulation after initiating hemodialysis, and that patients who underwent hemodialysis had lower brain Abeta accumulation than those who did not. Here, plasma total tau concentrations from 30 patients undergoing hemodialysis were measured using an ultrasensitive immunoassay and compared to those from 11 age-matched controls. Plasma total tau concentrations were higher in patients with renal failure regardless of whether they underwent hemodialysis, suggesting the involvement of the kidneys in tau degradation and excretion. Hemodialyzers effectively removed blood Abeta but not extracorporeal blood tau. The influx of tau into the blood was observed at around the 1 h period during hemodialysis sessions. However, the influx amount of tau was far smaller than that of Abeta. Furthermore, histopathological analysis revealed similar, not significantly less, cerebral cortex phosphorylated tau accumulation between the 17 patients who underwent hemodialysis and the 16 age-matched subjects who did not, although both groups showed sparse accumulation. These findings suggest that hemodialysis may induce both tau and Abeta migration into the blood. However, as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease, it may only be effective for removing Abeta from the brain.",

    "title": "Lithium as a Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease: The Systems Pharmacology Perspective.",
    "abstract": "Systems pharmacology is a novel framework for drug research that models traditional and innovative pharmacological parameters and provides the overall efficacy and safety profile of a drug across body systems and complex, non-linear, molecular interactions. Lithium chloride, a pharmacological compound approved for the therapy of psychiatric disorders, represents a poorly explored compound for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lithium has been shown to reduce downstream effects associated with the aberrant overactivation of certain molecular pathways, such as glycogen synthase kinase 3 subunit beta (GSK3-beta)-related pathways, involved in AD-related pathophysiology. It seems that overactivation and overexpression of GSK3-beta lead to an impairment of long-term potentiation and amyloid-beta induced neurotoxicity that can be normalized using lithium. Moreover, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that lithium's GSK3-beta inhibitory effect prevents tau phosphorylation in mouse models of tauopathies. Clinical data have been inconclusive, partly due to methodological limitations. The lack of studies exploring the dynamics of protein misfolding in AD and investigating the specific tau-isoforms appearing prior to the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles calls for new and optimized clinical trials. Advanced computer modeling based on a formal implementation of quantitative parameters and basic enzymatic insights into a mechanism-based model would present a good start to tackle these non-linear interactions. This innovative approach will pave the way for developing \"molecularly\" biomarker-guided targeted therapies, i.e., treatments specifically adapted (\"tailored\") to the individual, consistently with the primary objectives and key conceptual points of precision medicine and precision pharmacology.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive and memory function impairment. Studies have shown that the overproduction and further misfolding of amyloid polypeptide (Abeta) are the main causes of AD. Therefore, how to reduce Abeta species, especially to disassemble the preformed amyloid aggregates, has become the focus of related research. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using normal photosensitizers eg. porphyrins, is a traditional way of inhibiting amyloid aggregation or degrading the amyloid aggregates, but UV light irradiation presents a side effect for the damage of normal tissue, which limits its medical application. Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) is a luminous material which can be modified by photodynamic agent to form the complex generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) with noninvasive light irradiation. It presents a good advantage in the disassembly of amyloid aggregates via ROS in noninvasive light irradiation. Herein, we prepared beta-NaYF4:Yb/Er@SiO2@RB by combing UCNPs with photosensitizer to disassemble preformed Abeta aggregates under near-infrared light. The results displayed upconversion nanomaterials could degrade Abeta1-42 fibrils effectively by photo-generating ROS, which demonstrated that the functional UCNPs may have potential applications in the treatment of amyloid diseases in future.",

    "abstract": "Irie and colleagues identified a \"toxic conformer\", which possesses a turn structure at positions 22-23, among various conformations of Abeta and have been reporting its potent oligomeric capacity and neurotoxicity. This toxic conformer was detected in the brains of AD patients and AD model mice (Tg2576 line), and passive immunization targeting this conformer ameliorated the cognitive dysfunction in an AD model. In this study, we developed a novel AD mouse model (AppNL-P-F/NL-P-F) with Swedish mutation (NL), Iberian mutation (F), and mutation (P) overproducing E22P-Abeta, a mimic of the toxic conformer, utilizing the knock-in technique that well recapitulates the Abeta pathology of AD patients in mice and avoids the artificial phenotype observed in transgenic-type model mice. We confirmed that AppNL-P-F/NL-P-F mice produce Abeta by ELISA and accumulate senile plaques by immunohistochemistry at eight months of age. In WB, we observed a potential trimer band and high molecular-weight oligomer bands without a monomeric band in the TBS-soluble fraction of AppNL-P-F/NL-P-F mice at six months of age. In the novel object recognition test, cognitive impairment was observed at six months of age in these mice. These findings suggest that the toxic conformer of Abeta induces cognitive dysfunction mediated by its oligomer formation in this mouse brain. AppNL-P-F/NL-P-F mice may be a useful model for evaluating Abeta oligomer-induced cognitive impairment in AD and will aid in exploring therapeutic targets for AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "In sporadic and dominantly inherited Alzheimer disease (AD), aggregation of both tau and alpha-synuclein may occur in neurons. Aggregates of either protein occur separately or coexist in the same neuron. It is not known whether the coaggregation of tau and alpha-synuclein in dominantly inherited AD occurs in association with specific mutations of the APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 genes. The aim of this study was to provide the first characterization of the neuropathologic phenotype associated with the PSEN1 p.A396T mutation in a man who was clinically diagnosed as having AD, but for whom the PSEN1 mutation was found postmortem. The proband, who was 56 years old when cognitive impairment first manifested, died at 67 years of age. Neuropathologically, 3 proteinopathies were present in the brain. Widespread alpha-synuclein-immunopositive neuronal inclusions suggested a diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), while severe and widespread tau and amyloid-beta pathologies confirmed the clinical diagnosis of AD. Immunohistochemistry revealed the coexistence of tau and alpha-synuclein aggregates in the same neuron. Neuropathologic and molecular studies in brains of carriers of the PSEN1 p.A396T mutation or other PSEN1 or PSEN2 mutations associated with the coexistence of DLBD and AD are needed to clarify whether tau and alpha-synuclein proteinopathies occur independently or whether a relationship exists between alpha-synuclein and tau that might explain the mechanisms of coaggregation.",

Here, we integrate the existing literature on histopathology of Abeta and its convergence and divergence with in vivo Abeta imaging. The evidence presented amounts to a reconceptualization, in which we advocate for a closer look into Abeta accumulation rates in earlier life, the factors that promote accumulation, comparative studies with different markers of Abeta, and longitudinal designs to elucidate when AD pathology rises and how it shifts from benign to malignant stages that ultimately define AD.

    "abstract": "Spatial heterogeneity in the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques throughout the brain during asymptomatic as well as clinical stages of Alzheimer disease calls for precise localization and quantification of this protein using PET imaging. To address this need, we have developed and evaluated a technique that quantifies the extent of amyloid-beta pathology on a millimeter-by-millimeter scale in the brain with unprecedented precision using data from PET scans. Methods: An intermodal and intrasubject registration with normalized mutual information as the cost function was used to transform all FreeSurfer neuroanatomic labels into PET image space, which were subsequently used to compute regional SUV ratio (SUVR). We have evaluated our technique using postmortem histopathologic staining data from 52 older participants as the standard-of-truth measurement. Results: Our method resulted in consistently and significantly higher SUVRs in comparison to the conventional method in almost all regions of interest. A 2-way ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of method as well as a significant interaction effect of method on the relationship between computed SUVR and histopathologic staining score. Conclusion: These findings suggest that processing the amyloid-beta PET data in subjects' native space can improve the accuracy of the computed SUVRs, as they are more closely associated with the histopathologic staining data than are the results of the conventional approach.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because AD pathologies begin two decades before the onset of dementia, prevention of Abeta amyloidosis has been proposed as a mean to block the pathological cascade. Here, we generate a transgenic plant-based vaccine, a soybean storage protein containing Abeta4-10, named Abeta+, for oral Abeta immunization. One mg of Abeta+ or control protein (Abeta-) was administered to TgCRND8 mice once a week from 9 weeks up to 58 weeks. Abeta+ immunization raised both anti-Abeta antibodies and cellular immune responses. Spatial learning decline was prevented in the Abeta+ immunized group in an extended reference memory version of Morris water maze test from 21 to 57 weeks. In Tris-buffered saline (TBS), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and formic acid (FA) serial extractions, all sets of Abeta species from Abeta monomer, low to high molecular weight Abeta oligomers, and Abeta smears had different solubility in TgCRND8 brains. Abeta oligomers decreased in TBS fractions, corresponding to an increase in high molecular weight Abeta oligomers in SDS extracts and Abeta smears in FA fraction of the Abeta+ treated group. There was significant inhibition of histological Abeta burden, especially in diffuse plaques, and suppression of microglial inflammation. Processing of amyloid-beta protein precursor was not different between Abeta+ and Abeta- groups. No evidence of amyloid-related inflammatory angiopathy was observed. Thus, Abeta+ oral immunization could be a promising, cheap, and long-term safe disease-modifying therapy to prevent the pathological process in AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are increasingly used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, important methodological and technical remain regarding measurement variability between kit providers and users. We compared the Lumipulse fully automated assays with the manual INNOTEST assays (both from Fujirebio Europe NV, Gent, Belgium) on a clinically representative sample of patients and controls. METHODS: CSF samples of 156 patients were used to quantify Amyloid Abeta1-42 peptide (Abeta1-42) and Total-Tau (T-Tau) protein by chemiluminescent enzyme-immunoassay (Lumipulse). Patients were divided into several subgroups: Alzheimer (AD = 44), mild-cognitive impairment (MCI = 23), other dementias (OD = 36), non-dementing neurological conditions (ND = 11), and controls (CTRL = 42). Clinical cut-offs were determined by comparing AD and CTRL with ROC curves for the two markers and their related ratio (T-Tau/Abeta1-42). Subgroups of 58 (for phosphorylated-Tau) and 115 samples (for Abeta1-42 and T-Tau) were used to evaluate the concordance of this analyzer with the INNOTEST assays. RESULTS: Lumipulse and INNOTEST assays showed good concordance for all markers, but systematic bias was observed justifying the need to redefine new clinical cut-offs. To discriminate AD from CTRL subjects, T-Tau/Abeta1-42 ratio was the best biomarker, with a cut-off value of 1.12 (sensitivity 81.8% and specificity 92.9%). Similar clinical performances were observed for the Lumipulse and Innotests assays on the subsample of 115 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the Lumipulse Abeta1-42 and T-Tau assays show good analytical and clinical performances in the context of patient evaluation referred to a memory clinic. Automated analyzers should be preferred for the measurement of CSF AD biomarkers to reduce inter- and intra-laboratory variability.",

    "abstract": "Importance: Previous genome-wide association studies of common variants identified associations for Alzheimer disease (AD) loci evident only among individuals with particular APOE alleles. Objective: To identify APOE genotype-dependent associations with infrequent and rare variants using whole-exome sequencing. Design, Setting, and Participants: The discovery stage included 10 441 non-Hispanic white participants in the Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project. Replication was sought in 2 independent, whole-exome sequencing data sets (1766 patients with AD, 2906 without AD [controls]) and a chip-based genotype imputation data set (8728 patients with AD, 9808 controls). Bioinformatics and functional analyses were conducted using clinical, cognitive, neuropathologic, whole-exome sequencing, and gene expression data obtained from a longitudinal cohort sample including 402 patients with AD and 647 controls. Data were analyzed between March 2017 and September 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Score, Firth, and sequence kernel association tests were used to test the association of AD risk with individual variants and genes in subgroups of APOE epsilon4 carriers and noncarriers. Results with P <= 1 x 10-5 were further evaluated in the replication data sets and combined by meta-analysis. Results: Among 3145 patients with AD and 4213 controls lacking epsilon4 (mean [SD] age, 83.4 [7.6] years; 4363 [59.3.%] women), novel genome-wide significant associations were obtained in the discovery sample with rs536940594 in AC099552 (odds ratio [OR], 88.0; 95% CI, 9.08-852.0; P = 2.22 x 10-7) and rs138412600 in GPAA1 (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.44-2.2; meta-P = 7.81 x 10-8). GPAA1 was also associated with expression in the brain of GPAA1 (beta = -0.08; P = .03) and its repressive transcription factor, FOXG1 (beta = 0.13; P = .003), and global cognition function (beta = -0.53; P = .009). Significant gene-wide associations (threshold P <= 6.35 x 10-7) were observed for OR8G5 (P = 4.67 x 10-7), IGHV3-7 (P = 9.75 x 10-16), and SLC24A3 (P = 2.67 x 10-12) in 2377 patients with AD and 706 controls with epsilon4 (mean [SD] age, 75.2 [9.6] years; 1668 [54.1%] women). Conclusions and Relevance: The study identified multiple possible novel associations for AD with individual and aggregated rare variants in groups of individuals with and without APOE epsilon4 alleles that reinforce known and suggest additional pathways leading to AD.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of our study is to understand the protective role of miR-455-3p against abnormal amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, amyloid beta (Abeta) formation, defective mitochondrial biogenesis/dynamics and synaptic damage in AD progression. In-silico analysis of miR-455-3p has identified the APP gene as a putative target. Using mutant APP cells, miR-455-3p construct, biochemical and molecular assays, immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses, we studied the protective effects of miR-455-3p on - 1) APP regulation, amyloid beta (Abeta)(1-40) & (1-42) levels, mitochondrial biogenesis & dynamics; 3) synaptic activities and 4) cell viability & apoptosis. Our luciferase reporter assay confirmed the binding of miR-455-3p at the 3'UTR of APP gene. Immunoblot, sandwich ELISA and immunostaining analyses revealed that the reduced levels of the mutant APP, Abeta(1-40) & Abeta(1-42), and C99 by miR-455-3p. We also found the reduced levels of mRNA and proteins of mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC1alpha, NRF1, NRF2, and TFAM) and synaptic genes (synaptophysin and PSD95) in mutant APP cells; on the other hand, mutant APP cells that express miR-455-3p showed increased mRNA and protein levels of biogenesis and synaptic genes. Additionally, expression of mitochondrial fission proteins (DRP1 and FIS1) were decreased while the fusion proteins (OPA1, Mfn1 and Mfn2) were increased by miR-455-3p. Our TEM analysis showed a decrease in mitochondria number and an increase in the size of mitochondrial length in mutant APP cells transfected with miR-455-3p. Based on these observations, we cautiously conclude that miR-455-3p regulate APP processing and protective against mutant APP-induced mitochondrial and synaptic abnormalities in AD.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. As an intrinsically disordered protein, Abeta undergoes extensive dynamics on multiple length and time scales. Access to a comprehensive picture of the reorientational dynamics in Abeta requires therefore the combination of complementary techniques. Here, we integrate 15N spin relaxation rates at three magnetic fields with microseconds-long molecular dynamics simulation, ensemble-based hydrodynamic calculations, and previously published nanosecond fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to investigate the reorientational dynamics of Abeta1-40 (Abeta40) at single-residue resolution. The integrative analysis shows that librational and dihedral angle fluctuations occurring at fast and intermediate time scales are not sufficient to decorrelate orientational memory in Abeta40. Instead, slow segmental motions occurring at ~5 ns are detected throughout the Abeta40 sequence and reach up to ~10 ns for selected residues. We propose that the modulation of time scales of reorientational dynamics with respect to intra- and intermolecular diffusion plays an important role in disease-related Abeta aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) consists of beta-amyloid deposition in the walls of the cerebrovasculature and is commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the association of CAA with repetitive head impacts (RHI) and with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is unknown. We evaluated the relationship between RHI from contact sport participation, CTE, and CAA within a group of deceased contact sport athletes (n = 357), a community-based cohort (n = 209), and an AD cohort from Boston University AD Center (n = 241). Unsupervised hierarchal cluster analysis demonstrated a unique cluster (n = 11) with increased CAA in the leptomeningeal vessels compared to the intracortical vessels (p < 0.001) comprised of participants with significantly greater frequencies of CTE (7/11) and history of RHI. Overall, participants with CTE (n = 251) had more prevalent (p < 0.001) and severe (p = 0.010) CAA within the frontal leptomeningeal vessels compared to intracortical vessels. Compared to those with AD, participants with CTE had more severe CAA in frontal than parietal lobes (p < 0.001) and more severe CAA in leptomeningeal than intracortical vessels (p = 0.002). The overall frequency of CAA in participants with CTE was low, and there was no significant association between contact sport participation and the presence of CAA. However, in those with CAA, a history of contact sports was associated with increased CAA severity in the frontal leptomeningeal vessels (OR = 4.01, 95% CI 2.52-6.38, p < 0.001) adjusting for AD, APOE epsilon4 status, and age. Participants with CAA had increased levels of sulcal tau pathology and decreased levels of the synaptic marker PSD-95 (p's < 0.05), and CAA was a predictor of dementia (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.02-2.99, p = 0.043) adjusting for age, sex, and comorbid pathology. Overall, contact sport participation and CTE were associated with more severe frontal and leptomeningeal CAA, and CAA was independently associated with worse pathological and clinical outcomes.",

The amyloid-beta (Abeta40) and Abeta42 levels were elevated in hippocampi and platelets from SAMP8, along with a reduced alpha-secretase expression and an enhanced beta-secretase expression extent with age, compared to control mice. Furthermore, hippocampal Abeta40 and Abeta42 of SAMP8 were positively correlated with platelet of these mice with aging progression. In addition, beta-gamma-secretase-modulated proteolytic proceeding of amyloid precursor protein in platelet might work through the PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta pathway.

    "abstract": "To address the question of cross-talk between prion protein (PrP) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), we generated TgAD/GSS mice that develop amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques of AD and PrP (specifically mutated PrPA116V) plaques of Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSS) and compared plaque-related features in these mice to AD mice that express normal (TgAD), high (TgAD/HuPrP), or no (TgAD/PrP-/-) PrPC. In contrast to PrPC, PrPA116V weakly co-localized to Abeta plaques, did not co-immunoprecipitate with Abeta, and poorly bound to Abeta in an ELISA-based binding assay. Despite the reduced association of PrPA116V with Abeta, TgAD/GSS and TgAD/HuPrP mice that express comparable levels of PrPA116V and PrPC respectively, displayed similar increases in Abeta plaque burden and steady state levels of Abeta and its precursor APP compared with TgAD mice. Our Tg mouse lines also revealed a predominance of intracellular Abeta plaques in mice lacking PrPC (TgAD/PrP-/-, TgAD/GSS) compared with an extracellular predominance in PrPC-expressing mice (TgAD, TgAD/HuPrP). Parallel studies in N2aAPPswe cells revealed a direct dependence on PrPC but not PrPA116V for exosome-related secretion of Abeta. Overall, our findings are two-fold; they suggest that PrP expression augments Abeta plaque production, at least in part by an indirect mechanism, perhaps by increasing steady state levels of APP, while they also provide support for a fundamental role of PrPC to bind to and deliver intraneuronal Abeta to exosomes for secretion.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the key factors that govern the rate of protein aggregation is of immense interest since protein aggregation is associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Previous experimental and theoretical studies have revealed that the hydrophobicity, charge, and population of the fibril-prone monomeric state control the fibril formation rate. Because the fibril structures consist of cross beta sheets, it is widely believed that those sequences that have a high beta content (beta) in the monomeric state should have high aggregation rates as the monomer can serve as a template for fibril growth. However, this important fact has never been explicitly proven, motivating us to carry out this study. Using replica exchange molecular dynamics simulation with implicit water, we have computed beta of 19 mutations of amyloid beta peptide of 42 residues (Abeta42) for which the aggregation rate kappa has been measured experimentally. We have found that kappa depends on beta in such a way that the higher the propensity to aggregation, the higher the beta content in the monomeric state. Thus, we have solved a long-standing problem of the dependence of fibril formation time of the beta-structure on a quantitative level.",

    "abstract": "No disease-modifying therapy is currently available for Alzheimer's disease, but therapies are in development, and one may become available in the near future. Based on results from early-stage clinical trials, therapeutic development has focused on the hypothesis that Alzheimer's dementia must be prevented rather than cured, because candidate treatments have not been able to reverse the course of dementia. Thus, current trials target patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease. Were a therapy to become available, patients could undergo first screening for signs of early-stage memory loss or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), testing for the Alzheimer's disease pathology, and then treatment with the aim of halting or slowing progression to Alzheimer's dementia. An important health systems challenge will arise if this new treatment paradigm bears out in late-stage clinical trials. In the 28 European Union countries, we estimate that approximately 20 million individuals over age 55 have MCI, although most people have not been tested for disease pathology. Thus, when a therapy first becomes available, there would be a substantial number of existing (or prevalent) MCI patients who would require screening, diagnosis, and then treatment as quickly as possible to prevent the progression to full-blown Alzheimer's dementia. This research analyzes the preparedness of the health care systems in six European countries-France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom-to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment of patients if a disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's becomes available.",

    "abstract": "The \"two-hit vascular hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease (AD)\" and amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomer hypothesis suggest that impaired soluble Abeta oligomers clearance through the cerebral vasculature may be an initial step of the AD process. Soluble Abeta oligomers are driven into perivascular spaces from the brain parenchyma and toward peripheral blood flow. The underlying vascular-based mechanism, however, has not been defined. Given that microRNAs (miRNAs), emerging as novel modulators, are involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes, we hypothesized that cerebrovascular miRNAs may regulate the activities of brain blood vessels, which further affects the concentration of Abeta in the AD brain. In this study, perivascular Abeta deposits, higher vascular activation, increased pericyte coverage and up-regulated capillaries miRNAs at 6 months old (6 mo) were found to correlate with the lower Abeta levels of middle AD stage (9 mo) in 3xTg-AD (3xTg) mice. It is implicated that at the early stage of AD when intracellular Abeta appeared, higher expression of vessel-specific miRNAs, elevated pericyte coverage, and activated endothelium facilitate Abeta oligomer clearance through the perivascular route, resulting in a transient reduction of Abeta oligomers at 9 mo. Additionally, ghrelin-induced upregulation of capillary miRNAs and increased pericyte coverage attenuated Abeta burden at 9 mo, in further support of the relationship between vascular miRNAs and Abeta clearance. This work suggests a cerebral microvessel miRNA may boost endothelial highly activated phenotypes to promote elimination of Abeta oligomers through the perivascular drainage pathway and contribute to AD progression. The targeting of brain vessel-specific miRNAs may provide a new rationale for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Older adults with Down syndrome (DS) often have Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathologies. Although positron emission tomography imaging studies of amyloid deposition (beta amyloid, Abeta) have been associated with worse clinical prognosis and cognitive impairment, their relationships with cortical thickness remain unclear in people with DS. In a sample of 44 DS adults who underwent cognitive assessments, [11C]-PiB positron emission tomography, and T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo, we used mixed effect models to evaluate the spatial relationships between Abeta binding with patterns of cortical thickness. Partial Spearman correlations were used to delineate the topography of local Abeta-associated cortical thinning. [11C]-PiB nondisplaceable binding potential was negatively associated with decreased cortical thickness. Locally, regional [11C]-PiB retention was negatively correlated with cortical thickness in widespread cortices, predominantly in temporoparietal regions. Contrary to the prevailing evidence in established AD, we propose that our findings implicate Abeta in spatial patterns of atrophy that recapitulated the \"cortical signature\" of neurodegeneration in AD, conferring support to recent recommendations for earlier disease-interventions.",

    "title": "A Novel Apolipoprotein E Antagonist Functionally Blocks Apolipoprotein E Interaction With N-terminal Amyloid Precursor Protein, Reduces beta-Amyloid-Associated Pathology, and Improves Cognition.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The e4 isoform of apolipoprotein E (apoE4) is a major genetic risk factor for the development of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), and its modification has been an intense focus for treatment of AD during recent years. METHODS: We investigated the binding of apoE, a peptide corresponding to its low-density lipoprotein receptor binding domain (amino acids 133-152; ApoEp), and modified ApoEp to amyloid precursor protein (APP) and their effects on amyloid-beta (Abeta) production in cultured cells. Having discovered a peptide (6KApoEp) that blocks the interaction of apoE with N-terminal APP, we investigated the effects of this peptide and ApoEp on AD-like pathology and behavioral impairment in 3XTg-AD and 5XFAD transgenic mice. RESULTS: ApoE and ApoEp, but not truncated apoE lacking the low-density lipoprotein receptor binding domain, physically interacted with N-terminal APP and thereby mediated Abeta production. Interestingly, the addition of 6 lysine residues to the N-terminus of ApoEp (6KApoEp) directly inhibited apoE binding to N-terminal APP and markedly limited apoE- and ApoEp-mediated Abeta generation, presumably through decreasing APP cellular membrane trafficking and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. Moreover, while promoting apoE interaction with APP by ApoEp exacerbated Abeta and tau brain pathologies in 3XTg-AD mice, disrupting this interaction by 6KApoEp ameliorated cerebral Abeta and tau pathologies, neuronal apoptosis, synaptic loss, and hippocampal-dependent learning and memory impairment in 5XFAD mice without altering cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein receptor, and apoE expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that disrupting apoE interaction with N-terminal APP may be a novel disease-modifying therapeutic strategy for AD.",

    "abstract": "Early biomarkers are needed to identify individuals at high risk of preclinical Alzheimer's disease and to better understand the pathophysiological processes of disease progression. Preclinical Alzheimer's disease EEG changes would be non-invasive and cheap screening tools and could also help to predict future progression to clinical Alzheimer's disease. However, the impact of amyloid-beta deposition and neurodegeneration on EEG biomarkers needs to be elucidated. We included participants from the INSIGHT-preAD cohort, which is an ongoing single-centre multimodal observational study that was designed to identify risk factors and markers of progression to clinical Alzheimer's disease in 318 cognitively normal individuals aged 70-85 years with a subjective memory complaint. We divided the subjects into four groups, according to their amyloid status (based on 18F-florbetapir PET) and neurodegeneration status (evidenced by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET brain metabolism in Alzheimer's disease signature regions). The first group was amyloid-positive and neurodegeneration-positive, which corresponds to stage 2 of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. The second group was amyloid-positive and neurodegeneration-negative, which corresponds to stage 1 of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. The third group was amyloid-negative and neurodegeneration-positive, which corresponds to 'suspected non-Alzheimer's pathophysiology'. The last group was the control group, defined by amyloid-negative and neurodegeneration-negative subjects. We analysed 314 baseline 256-channel high-density eyes closed 1-min resting state EEG recordings. EEG biomarkers included spectral measures, algorithmic complexity and functional connectivity assessed with a novel information-theoretic measure, weighted symbolic mutual information. The most prominent effects of neurodegeneration on EEG metrics were localized in frontocentral regions with an increase in high frequency oscillations (higher beta and gamma power) and a decrease in low frequency oscillations (lower delta power), higher spectral entropy, higher complexity and increased functional connectivity measured by weighted symbolic mutual information in theta band. Neurodegeneration was associated with a widespread increase of median spectral frequency. We found a non-linear relationship between amyloid burden and EEG metrics in neurodegeneration-positive subjects, either following a U-shape curve for delta power or an inverted U-shape curve for the other metrics, meaning that EEG patterns are modulated differently depending on the degree of amyloid burden. This finding suggests initial compensatory mechanisms that are overwhelmed for the highest amyloid load. Together, these results indicate that EEG metrics are useful biomarkers for the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Deficits in Enrichment-Dependent Neurogenesis and Enhanced Anxiety Behaviors Mediated by Expression of Alzheimer's Disease-Linked Ps1 Variants Are Rescued by Microglial Depletion.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that presently affects an estimated 5.7 million Americans. Understanding the basis for this disease is key for the development of a future successful treatment. In this effort, we previously reported that mouse prion protein-promoter-driven, ubiquitous expression of familial AD (FAD)-linked human PSEN1 variants in transgenic mice impairs environmental enrichment (EE)-induced proliferation and neurogenesis of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells (AHNPCs) and in a non-cell autonomous manner. These findings were confirmed in PS1M146V/+ mice that harbor an FAD-linked mutation in the endogenous PSEN1 gene. We now demonstrate that CSF1R antagonist-mediated microglial depletion in transgenic male mice expressing mutant presenilin 1 (PS1) or PS1M146V/+ \"knock-in\" mice leads to a complete rescue of deficits in proliferation, differentiation and survival of AHNPCs. Moreover, microglia depletion suppressed the heightened baseline anxiety behavior observed in transgenic mice expressing mutant PS1 and PS1M146V/+ mice to levels observed in mice expressing wild-type human PS1 or nontransgenic mice, respectively. These findings demonstrate that in mice expressing FAD-linked PS1, microglia play a critical role in the regulation of EE-dependent AHNPC proliferation and neurogenesis and the modulation of affective behaviors.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Inheritance of mutations in genes encoding presenilin 1 (PS1) causes familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). Mutant PS1 expression enhances the levels and assembly of toxic Abeta42 peptides and impairs the self-renewal and neuronal differentiation of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells (AHNPCs) following environmental enrichment (EE) that is associated with heightened baseline anxiety. We now show that microglial depletion fully restores the EE-mediated impairments in AHNPC phenotypes and suppresses the heightened baseline anxiety observed in mice expressing FAD-linked PS1. Thus, we conclude that the memory deficits and anxiety-related behaviors in patients with PS1 mutations is a reflection not just of an increase in the levels of Abeta42 peptides, but to impairments in the self-renewal and neuronal differentiation of AHNPCs that modulate affective behaviors.",

Because most of the vascular resistance within the brain is in capillaries, this could reflect dysfunction of contractile pericytes on capillary walls. We used live and rapidly fixed biopsied human tissue to establish disease relevance, and rodent experiments to define mechanism. We found that in humans with cognitive decline, amyloid beta (Abeta) constricts brain capillaries at pericyte locations. This was caused by Abeta generating reactive oxygen species, which evoked the release of endothelin-1 (ET) that activated pericyte ETA receptors. Capillary, but not arteriole, constriction also occurred in vivo in a mouse model of AD. Thus, inhibiting the capillary constriction caused by Abeta could potentially reduce energy lack and neurodegeneration in AD.",

    "abstract": "Importance: Accurate blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD) might improve the diagnostic accuracy in primary care, referrals to memory clinics, and screenings for AD trials. Objective: To examine the accuracy of plasma beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau measured using fully automated assays together with other blood-based biomarkers to detect cerebral Abeta. Design, Setting, and Participants: Two prospective, cross-sectional, multicenter studies. Study participants were consecutively enrolled between July 6, 2009, and February 11, 2015 (cohort 1), and between January 29, 2000, and October 11, 2006 (cohort 2). Data were analyzed in 2018. The first cohort comprised 842 participants (513 cognitively unimpaired [CU], 265 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 64 with AD dementia) from the Swedish BioFINDER study. The validation cohort comprised 237 participants (34 CU, 109 MCI, and 94 AD dementia) from a German biomarker study. Main Outcome and Measures: The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio was used as the reference standard for brain Abeta status. Plasma Abeta42, Abeta40 and tau were measured using Elecsys immunoassays (Roche Diagnostics) and examined as predictors of Abeta status in logistic regression models in cohort 1 and replicated in cohort 2. Plasma neurofilament light chain (NFL) and heavy chain (NFH) and APOE genotype were also examined in cohort 1. Results: The mean (SD) age of the 842 participants in cohort 1 was 72 (5.6) years, with a range of 59 to 88 years, and 446 (52.5%) were female. For the 237 in cohort 2, mean (SD) age was 66 (10) years with a range of 23 to 85 years, and 120 (50.6%) were female. In cohort 1, plasma Abeta42 and Abeta40 predicted Abeta status with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.77-0.83). When adding APOE, the AUC increased significantly to 0.85 (95% CI, 0.82-0.88). Slight improvements were seen when adding plasma tau (AUC, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.83-0.88) or tau and NFL (AUC, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.84-0.89) to Abeta42, Abeta40 and APOE. The results were similar in CU and cognitively impaired participants, and in younger and older participants. Applying the plasma Abeta42 and Abeta40 model from cohort 1 in cohort 2 resulted in slightly higher AUC (0.86; 95% CI, 0.81-0.91), but plasma tau did not contribute. Using plasma Abeta42, Abeta40, and APOE in an AD trial screening scenario reduced positron emission tomography costs up to 30% to 50% depending on cutoff. Conclusions and Relevance: Plasma Abeta42 and Abeta40 measured using Elecsys immunoassays predict Abeta status in all stages of AD with similar accuracy in a validation cohort. Their accuracy can be further increased by analyzing APOE genotype. Potential future applications of these blood tests include prescreening of Abeta positivity in clinical AD trials to lower the costs and number of positron emission tomography scans or lumbar punctures.",

Functional TDP-43 aggregates form reversible, transient species such as nuclear bodies, stress granules, and myo-granules. Pathogenic, irreversible TDP-43 aggregates form in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other neurodegenerative conditions. Here we find the features of TDP-43 fibrils that confer both reversibility and irreversibility by determining structures of two segments reported to be the pathogenic cores of human TDP-43 aggregation: SegA (residues 311-360), which forms three polymorphs, all with dagger-shaped folds; and SegB A315E (residues 286-331 containing the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis hereditary mutation A315E), which forms R-shaped folds. Energetic analysis suggests that the dagger-shaped polymorphs represent irreversible fibril structures, whereas the SegB polymorph may participate in both reversible and irreversible fibrils. Our structures reveal the polymorphic nature of TDP-43 and suggest how the A315E mutation converts the R-shaped polymorph to an irreversible form that enhances pathology.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: To determine whether plasma apoE levels and APOE genotype are associated with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a prospective cohort design with 105 949 white individuals from the general population, we tested the association between plasma apoE at study enrolment and death during follow-up, and whether this was independent of APOE genotype. We confirmed the well-known association between APOE genotypes and mortality. For all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality, high levels of apoE were associated with increased risk, while for dementia-associated mortality low levels were associated with increased risk. For the highest vs. the fifth septile of plasma apoE, hazard ratios (HRs) were 1.20 (95% confidence interval 1.12-1.28) for all-cause mortality, 1.28 (1.13-1.44) for cardiovascular mortality, and 1.18 (1.05-1.32) for cancer mortality. Conversely, for the lowest vs. the fifth septile the HR was 1.44 (1.01-2.05) for dementia-associated mortality. Results were similar in analyses restricted to APOE e33 carriers. Examining genetically determined plasma apoE, a 1 mg/dL increase conferred risk ratios of 0.97 (0.92-1.03) for cardiovascular mortality and 1.01 (0.95-1.06) for cancer mortality, while a 1 mg/dL decrease conferred a risk ratio of 1.70 (1.36-2.12) for dementia-associated mortality. CONCLUSION: High plasma levels of apoE were associated with increased all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality, however of a non-causal nature, while low levels were causally associated with increased dementia-associated mortality.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To develop imaging biomarkers of diseases in the Lewy body spectrum and to validate these markers against postmortem neuropathologic findings. METHODS: Four cognitively normal participants with Parkinson disease (PD), 4 with PD with cognitive impairments, and 10 with dementia with Lewy bodies underwent amyloid imaging with [11C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) and dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging with [11C]Altropane. All 18 had annual neurologic examinations. All cognitively normal participants with PD developed cognitive impairment before death. Neuropathologic examinations assessed and scored Braak Lewy bodies, Thal distribution of amyloid, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease neuritic amyloid plaques, Braak neurofibrillary tangles, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, as well as total amyloid plaque burden in the superior frontal, superior parietal, occipital, and inferior temporal cortical regions. PET data were expressed as the standardized uptake value ratio with cerebellar reference. Analyses accounted for the interval between imaging and autopsy. RESULTS: All 18 patients met neuropathologic criteria for Lewy body disease; the DAT concentration was low in each case. All patients with elevated [11C]PiB retention measured in a neocortical aggregate had beta-amyloid deposits at autopsy. [11C]PiB retention significantly correlated with neuritic plaque burden and with total plaque burden. [11C]PiB retention also significantly correlated with the severity of both Braak stages of neurofibrillary tangle and Lewy body scores. Neuritic plaque burden was significantly associated with neurofibrillary tangle pathology. CONCLUSION: Antemortem [11C]Altropane PET is a sensitive measure of substantia nigra degeneration. [11C]PiB scans accurately reflect cortical amyloid deposits seen at autopsy. These findings support the use of molecular imaging in the evaluation of patients with Lewy body diseases.",

Yet, this is a major challenge as the assembly involves multiple heterogeneous and transient intermediates. Here, we analyze the co-aggregation of Abeta40 and Abeta16-22, two widely studied peptide fragments of Abeta42 implicated in Alzheimer's disease. We demonstrate that Abeta16-22 increases the aggregation rate of Abeta40 through a surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation mechanism. Discontinuous molecular dynamics simulations allowed aggregation to be tracked from the initial random coil monomer to the catalysis of nucleation on the fibril surface. Together, the results provide insight into how dynamic interactions between Abeta40 monomers/oligomers on the surface of preformed Abeta16-22 fibrils nucleate Abeta40 amyloid assembly. This new understanding may facilitate development of surfaces designed to enhance or suppress secondary nucleation and hence to control the rates and products of fibril assembly.",

    "abstract": "Assembly and deposition of insoluble amyloid fibrils with a distinctive cross-beta-sheet structure is the molecular hallmark of amyloidogenic diseases affecting the central nervous system as well as non-neuropathic amyloidosis. Amyloidogenic proteins form aggregates via kinetic pathways dictated by initial solution conditions. Often, early stage, cytotoxic, small globular amyloid oligomers (gOs) and curvilinear fibrils (CFs) precede the formation of late-stage rigid fibrils (RFs). Growing experimental evidence suggests that soluble gOs are off-pathway aggregates that do not directly convert into the final stage RFs. Yet, the kinetics of RFs aggregation under conditions that either promote or suppress the growth of gOs remain incompletely understood. Here we present a self-assembly model for amyloid fibril formation in the presence and absence of early stage off-pathway aggregates, driven by our experimental results on hen egg white lysozyme (HewL) and beta amyloid (Abeta) aggregation. The model reproduces a range of experimental observations including the sharp boundary in the protein concentration above which the self-assembly of gOs occurs. This is possible when both primary and secondary RFs nucleation rates are allowed to have a nonlinear dependence on initial protein concentration, hinting toward more complex prenucleation and RFs assembly scenarios. Moreover, analysis of RFs lag period in the presence and absence of gOs indicates that these off-pathway aggregates have an inhibitory effect on RFs nucleation. Finally, we incorporate the effect of an Abeta binding protein on the aggregation process in the model that allows us to identify the most suitable solution conditions for suppressing gOs and RFs formation.",

    "abstract": "The variation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) concentration and Abeta aggregation are closely associated with the etiology of Alzheimer's diseases (AD). The interaction of Abeta with the monosialoganglioside-rich neuronal cell membrane has been suggested to influence Abeta aggregation. Therefore, studies on the mechanism of Abeta and sialic acids (SA) interaction would greatly contribute to better understanding the pathogenesis of AD. Herein, we report a novel approach for Abeta-SA interaction analysis and highly sensitive Abeta detection by mimicing the cell surface presentation of SA clusters through engineering of SA-modified peptide nanofiber (SANF). The SANF displayed well-ordered 1D nanostructure with high density of SA on surface. Using FAM-labeled Abeta fragments of Abeta1-16, Abeta16-23, and Abeta24-40, the interaction between Abeta and SA was evaluated by the fluorescence titration experiments. It was found that the order of the SA-binding affinity was Abeta1-16 > Abeta24-40 > Abeta16-23. Importantly, the presence of full-length Abeta1-40 monomer triggered a significant fluorescence enhancement due to the multivalent binding of Abeta1-40 to the nanofiber. This fluorescent turn-on response showed high selectivity and sensitivity for Abeta1-40 detection and the method was further used for Abeta aggregation process monitoring and inhibitor screening. The results suggest the proposed strategy is promising to serve as a tool for mechanism study and the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, metal ions, mainly Cu and Zn ions, bound to the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a widespread neurodegenerative disease. They indeed impact the aggregation pathways of Abeta and are involved in the catalytic generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that participate in oxidative stress, while Abeta aggregation and oxidative stress are regarded as two key events in AD etiology. Cu ions due to their redox ability have been considered to be the main potential therapeutic targets in AD. A considerable number of ligands have been developed in order to modulate the toxicity associated with Cu in this context, via disruption of the Abeta-Cu interaction. Among them, small synthetic ligands and small peptide scaffolds have been designed and studied for their ability to remove Cu from Abeta. Some of those ligands are able to prevent Cu(Abeta)-induced ROS production and can modify the aggregation pathways of Abeta in vitro and in cellulo. Examples of such ligands are gathered in this Viewpoint, as a function of their structures and discussed with respect to their properties against Cu(Abeta) deleterious fallouts. Nevertheless, the beneficial activities of the most promising ligands detected in vitro and in cellulo have not been transposed to human yet. Some parameters that might explain this apparent contradiction and key concepts to consider for the design of \"more\" efficient ligands are thus reported and discussed. En passant, this Viewpoint sheds light on the difficulties in comparing the results from one study to another that hamper significant advances in the field.",

    "title": "Human amyloid-beta enriched extracts: evaluation of in vitro and in vivo internalization and molecular characterization.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intracerebral inoculation of extracts from post-mortem human Alzheimer's disease brains into mice produces a prion-like spreading effect of amyloid-beta. The differences observed between these extracts and the synthetic peptide, in terms of amyloid-beta internalization and seed and cell-to-cell transmission of cytosolic protein aggregates, suggest that brain extracts contain key contributors that enhance the prion-like effect of amyloid-beta. Nevertheless, these potential partners are still unknown due to the complexity of whole brain extracts. METHODS: Herein, we established a method based on sequential detergent solubilization of post-mortem samples of human brains affected by Alzheimer's disease that strongly enrich amyloid-beta aggregates by eliminating 92% of the remaining proteins. Internalization of Abeta1-42 from the enriched AD extracts was evaluated in vitro, and internalization of fluorescent-labeled AD extracts was also investigated in vivo. Furthermore, we carried out a molecular characterization of the Abeta-enriched fraction using label-free proteomics, studying the distribution of representative components in the amygdala and the olfactory cortex of additional human AD brain samples by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Abeta1-42 from the enriched AD extracts are internalized into endothelial cells in vitro after 48 h. Furthermore, accumulation of fluorescent-labeled Abeta-enriched extracts into mouse microglia was observed in vivo after 4 months of intracerebral inoculation. Label-free proteomics (FDR < 0.01) characterization of the amyloid-beta-enriched fraction from different post-mortem samples allowed for the identification of more than 130 proteins, several of which were significantly overrepresented (i.e., ANXA5 and HIST1H2BK; p < 0.05) and underrepresented (i.e., COL6A or FN1; p < 0.05) in the samples with Alzheimer's disease. We were also able to identify proteins exclusively observed in Alzheimer's disease (i.e., RNF213) or only detected in samples not affected by the disease (i.e., CNTN1) after the enrichment process. Immunohistochemistry against these proteins in additional tissues revealed their particular distribution in the amygdala and the olfactory cortex in relation to the amyloid-beta plaque. CONCLUSIONS: Identification and characterization of the unique features of these extracts, in terms of amyloid-beta enrichment, identification of the components, in vitro and in vivo cell internalization, and tissue distribution, constitute the best initial tool to further investigate the seeding and transmissibility proposed in the prion-like hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease.",

METHODS: We examined baseline plasma beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels in relationship to incident dementia during a period of 8.5 years in 2840 subjects age >75 years; 2381 were cognitively normal (CN) and 450 mild cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Increased plasma Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 levels were associated with gender (women), age, low education, creatinine levels, history of stroke, and hypertension. CN participants who developed dementia had lower levels of Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio compared with those who did not. Abeta levels did not predict dementia in mild cognitive impairment participants. DISCUSSION: There was an inverse association between Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio to risk of dementia in CN participants. Cerebral and cardiovascular disease and renal function are important determinants of increased Abeta levels and must be considered in evaluations of relationship of plasma Abeta and subsequent risk of dementia.",

    "abstract": "Elevated cortisol as a measure of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis hyperactivity has emerged as a predictor of clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), in conjunction with amyloid-beta (Abeta) abnormalities. Yet factors exist which have the propensity to delay AD symptomatic expression in the face of an AD-type biomarker-based pathological profile. This study sought to determine whether abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta and elevated cortisol levels are associated with clinical transition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD in cognitively normal (CN) individuals, and if this association is modified by reserve proxies. Data from 91 CN individuals participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with available morning CSF cortisol and Abeta42 were evaluated. Reserve was modelled as a latent composite score of standardized intracranial volume and lifetime experience proxies. Cox regressions were used to test associations between baseline CSF cortisol/Abeta42, reserve score and AD progression; adjusting for age, sex, apolipoprotein E genotype, and depressive symptoms. Individuals with elevated cortisol + abnormal Abeta42 levels at baseline showed highest risk of clinical progression. After a median of 84 months follow-up, significant cortisol/Abeta/ reserve interaction for clinical progression was noted (adjusted HR = 0.15, p < 0.001), suggesting a moderating effect of reserve on the association between cortisol/Abeta+ and clinical progression. Our findings indicate that cortisol hypersecretion accelerates clinical progression in CN individuals presenting with pathological Abeta42. High reserve reduces the associated AD progression risk in these high-risk individuals.",

We have identified a novel non-canonical function of several autophagy proteins in the conjugation of LC3 to Rab5+, clathrin+ endosomes containing beta-amyloid in a process of LC3-associated endocytosis (LANDO). We found that LANDO in microglia is a critical regulator of immune-mediated aggregate removal and microglial activation in a murine model of AD. Mice lacking LANDO but not canonical autophagy in the myeloid compartment or specifically in microglia have a robust increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the hippocampus and increased levels of neurotoxic beta-amyloid. This inflammation and beta-amyloid deposition were associated with reactive microgliosis and tau hyperphosphorylation. LANDO-deficient AD mice displayed accelerated neurodegeneration, impaired neuronal signaling, and memory deficits. Our data support a protective role for LANDO in microglia in neurodegenerative pathologies resulting from beta-amyloid deposition.",

A bidirectional relation is underlined between amyloid-beta (Ass) and sleep disruptions. The sleep profile in participants at risk to develop AD is not fully deciphered. We aim to investigate sleep-wake changes with objective sleep measurements in elderly participants without cognitive impairment depending on their brain amyloid status, positive (Ass+) or negative (Ass-) based on standard absorption ratios (SUVr) positron emission tomography-florbetapir imaging. METHODS: Sixty-eight participants without cognitive impairment who have accepted to be involved in the sleep ancillary study from the InveStIGation of Alzheimer's Predictors in Subjective Memory Complainers (INSIGHT-pre AD) cohort, aiming to record sleep profile based on the analyses of an ambulatory accelerometer-based assessment (seven consecutive 24-hour periods). Neuropsychological tests were performed and sleep parameters have been individualized by actigraph. Participants also underwent a magnetic resonance imaging scan to assess their hippocampal volume. Based on SUVr PET-florbetapir imaging, two groups Ass+ and Ass- were compared. RESULTS: Participants were divided into two groups: Ass+ (n = 24) and Ass- (n = 44). Except for the SUVr, the two subgroups were comparable. When looking to sleep parameters, increased sleep latency, sleep fragmentation (wake after sleep onset [WASO] score and awakenings) and worst sleep efficiency were associated with cortical brain amyloid load. CONCLUSION: Actigraphic sleep parameters were associated with cortical brain amyloid load in participants at risk to develop AD. The detection of sleep abnormalities in those participants may be of interest to propose some preventive strategies.",

    "title": "Common BACE2 Polymorphisms are Associated with Altered Risk for Alzheimer's Disease and CSF Amyloid Biomarkers in APOE epsilon4 Non-Carriers.",
    "abstract": "It was recently suggested that beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 2 (BACE2) functions as an amyloid beta (Abeta)-degrading enzyme; in addition to its better understood role as an APP secretase. Due to this finding we sought to understand the possible genetic risk contributed by the BACE2 locus to the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we report that common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation in BACE2 is associated with altered AD risk in apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) epsilon 4 variant (epsilon4) non-carriers. In addition, in epsilon4 non-carriers diagnosed with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), SNPs within the BACE2 locus are associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Abeta1-42. Further, SNP variants in BACE2 are also associated with BACE2 RNA expression levels suggesting a potential mechanism for the CSF Abeta1-42 findings. Lastly, overexpression of BACE2 in vitro resulted in decreased Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 fragments in a cell line model of Abeta production. These findings suggest that genetic variation at the BACE2 locus modifies AD risk for those individuals who don't carry the epsilon4 variant of APOE. Further, our data indicate that the biological mechanism associated with this altered risk is linked to amyloid generation or clearance possibly through BACE2 expression changes.",

    "title": "Brain Amyloid PET Tracer Delivery is Related to White Matter Integrity in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amyloid deposition, tau neurofibrillary tangles, and cerebrovascular dysfunction are important pathophysiologic features in Alzheimer's disease. Pittsburgh compound B ([11 C]-PIB) is a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer used to quantify amyloid deposition in vivo. In addition, certain models of [11 C]-PIB delivery reflect cerebral blood flow rather than amyloid plaques. As cerebral blood flow and perfusion deficits are associated with white matter pathology, we hypothesized that [11 C]-PIB delivery in white matter regions may reflect white matter integrity. METHODS: We obtained [11 C]-PIB-PET scans and quantified white matter hyperintensities and global fractional anisotropy on magnetic resonance images as biomarkers of white matter pathology in 34 older participants with mild cognitive impairment with or without a history of major depressive disorder. We analyzed the [11 C]-PIB time-activity curve data with models associated with cerebral blood flow: the early maximum standard uptake value and the relative delivery parameter R1. We used a global white matter region of interest. RESULTS: Both of the partial-volume corrected PET parameters were correlated with white matter hyperintensities and fractional anisotropy. CONCLUSION: Future studies are warranted to explore whether [11 C]-PIB PET is a \"triple biomarker\" that may provide information about amyloid deposition, cerebral blood flow, and white matter pathology.",

    "title": "Amyloid-beta impairs insulin signaling by accelerating autophagy-lysosomal degradation of LRP-1 and IR-beta in blood-brain barrier endothelial cells in vitro and in 3XTg-AD mice.",
    "abstract": "Aberrant insulin signaling constitutes an early change in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Insulin receptors (IR) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) are expressed in brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC) forming the blood-brain barrier (BBB). There, insulin may regulate the function of LRP-1 in Abeta clearance from the brain. Changes in IR-beta and LRP-1 and insulin signaling at the BBB in AD are not well understood. Herein, we identified a reduction in cerebral and cerebrovascular IR-beta levels in 9-month-old male and female 3XTg-AD (PS1M146V, APPSwe, and tauP301L) as compared to NTg mice, which is important in insulin mediated signaling responses. Reduced cerebral IR-beta levels corresponded to impaired insulin signaling and LRP-1 levels in brain. Reduced cerebral and cerebrovascular IR-beta and LRP-1 levels in 3XTg-AD mice correlated with elevated levels of autophagy marker LC3B. In both genotypes, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding decreased cerebral and hepatic LRP-1 expression and elevated cerebral Abeta burden without affecting cerebrovascular LRP-1 and IR-beta levels. In vitro studies using primary porcine (p)BCEC revealed that Abeta peptides 1-40 or 1-42 (240 nM) reduced cellular levels and interaction of LRP-1 and IR-beta thereby perturbing insulin-mediated signaling. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that Abeta treatment accelerated the autophagy-lysosomal degradation of IR-beta and LRP-1 in pBCEC. LRP-1 silencing in pBCEC decreased IR-beta levels through post-translational pathways further deteriorating insulin-mediated responses at the BBB. Our findings indicate that LRP-1 proves important for insulin signaling at the BBB. Cerebral Abeta burden in AD may accelerate LRP-1 and IR-beta degradation in BCEC thereby contributing to impaired cerebral and cerebromicrovascular insulin effects.",

    "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS) is the main genetic cause of intellectual disability worldwide. The overexpression of the Amyloid Precursor Protein, present in chromosome 21, leads to beta-amyloid deposition that results in Alzheimer disease (AD) and, in most cases, also to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) neuropathology. People with DS invariably develop the neuropathological hallmarks of AD at the age of 40, and they are at an ultra high risk for suffering AD-related cognitive impairment thereafter. In the general population, cerebrovascular disease is a significant contributor to AD-related cognitive impairment, while in DS remains understudied. This review describes the current knowledge on cerebrovascular disease in DS and reviews the potential biomarkers that could be useful in the future studies, focusing on CAA. We also discuss available evidence on sporadic AD or other genetically determined forms of AD. We highlight the urgent need of large biomarker-characterized cohorts, including neuropathological correlations, to study the exact contribution of CAA and related vascular factors that play a role in cognition and occur with aging, their characterization and interrelationships. DS represents a unique context in which to perform these studies as this population is relatively protected from some conventional vascular risk factors and they develop significant CAA, DS represents a particular atheroma-free model to study AD-related vascular pathologies. Only deepening on these underlying mechanisms, new preventive and therapeutic strategies could be designed to improve the quality of life of this population and their caregivers and lead to new avenues of treatment also in the general AD population.",

    "title": "Repeated ultrasound treatment of tau transgenic mice clears neuronal tau by autophagy and improves behavioral functions.",
    "abstract": "Intracellular deposits of pathological tau are the hallmark of a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as tauopathies, with Alzheimer's disease, a secondary tauopathy, being further characterized by extracellular amyloid plaques. A major obstacle in developing effective treatments for tauopathies is the presence of the blood-brain barrier, which restricts the access of therapeutic agents to the brain. An emerging technology to overcome this limitation is the application of low-intensity ultrasound which, together with intravenously injected microbubbles, transiently opens the blood-brain barrier, thereby facilitating the delivery of therapeutic agents into the brain. Interestingly, even in the absence of therapeutic agents, ultrasound has previously been shown to reduce amyloid plaques and improve cognitive functions in amyloid-depositing mice through microglial clearance. Ultrasound has also been shown to facilitate the delivery of antibody fragments against pathological tau in P301L tau transgenic mice; however, the effect of ultrasound alone has not been thoroughly investigated in a tauopathy mouse model. Methods: Here, we performed repeated scanning ultrasound treatments over a period of 15 weeks in K369I tau transgenic mice with an early-onset tau-related motor and memory phenotype. We used immunohistochemical and biochemical methods to analyze the effect of ultrasound on the mice and determine the underlying mechanism of action, together with an analysis of their motor and memory functions following repeated ultrasound treatments. Results: Repeated ultrasound treatments significantly reduced tau pathology in the absence of histological damage. Associated impaired motor functions showed improvement towards the end of the treatment regime, with memory functions showing a trend towards improvement. In assessing potential clearance mechanisms, we ruled out a role for ubiquitination of tau, a prerequisite for proteasomal clearance. However, the treatment regime induced the autophagy pathway in neurons as reflected by an increase in the autophagosome membrane marker LC3II and a reduction in the autophagic flux marker p62, along with a decrease of mTOR activity and an increase in beclin 1 levels. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the interaction of tau and p62 in the ultrasound-treated mice, suggesting removal of tau by autophagosomes. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that a neuronal protein aggregate clearance mechanism induced by ultrasound-mediated blood-brain barrier opening operates for tau, further supporting the potential of low-intensity ultrasound to treat neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "title": "Safety and Efficacy of Edonerpic Maleate for Patients With Mild to Moderate Alzheimer Disease: A Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.",
    "abstract": "Importance: Edonerpic maleate (T-817MA) protects against Abeta40-induced neurotoxic effects and memory deficits, promotes neurite outgrowth, and preserves hippocampal synapses and spatial memory in tau transgenic mice. These effects may be mediated via sigma-1 receptor activation, delivery of synaptic AMPA receptors, or modulation of microglial function and may benefit patients with Alzheimer disease. Objective: To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of edonerpic for patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease. Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2 clinical trial conducted over 52 weeks from June 2, 2014, to December 14, 2016, at 52 US clinical and academic centers. Of 822 outpatients screened, 484 met the following criteria and were randomly assigned to treatment: 55 to 85 years of age, probable Alzheimer disease, Mini-Mental State Examination scores from 12 to 22, and taking stable doses of donepezil or rivastigmine with or without memantine. Interventions: Random assignment (1:1:1 allocation) to placebo or 224 mg or 448 mg of edonerpic maleate, once per day. Main Outcomes and Measures: Coprimary outcomes were scores on the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC) at week 52. Biomarkers were brain, lateral ventricular, and hippocampal volumes, as determined on magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid Abeta40, Abeta42, total tau, and phospho-tau181. The primary efficacy analysis was performed on the coprimary end points for the modified intention-to-treat population. Results: Of 482 participants in the safety population, 140 of 158 participants (88.6%) assigned to placebo, 117 of 166 participants (70.5%) to 224 mg of edonerpic maleate, and 120 of 158 participants (76.0%) to 448 mg of edonerpic maleate completed the trial. The mean ADAS-cog score change at week 52 was 7.91 for the placebo group, 7.45 for the 224-mg group, and 7.08 for the 448-mg group. Mean differences from placebo were -0.47 (95% CI, -2.36 to 1.43; P = .63) for the 224-mg group and -0.84 (95% CI, -2.75 to 1.08; P = .39) for the 448-mg group. Mean ADCS-CGIC scores were 5.22 for the placebo group, 5.24 for the 224-mg group, and 5.25 for the 448-mg group, with mean differences from placebo of 0.03 (95% CI, -0.20 to 0.25; P = .81) for the 224-mg group and 0.04 (95% CI, -0.19 to 0.26; P = .76) for the 448-mg group. In the safety population, a total of 7 of 158 participants (4.4%) in the placebo group, 23 of 166 participants (13.9%) in the 224-mg group, and 23 of 158 participants (14.6%) in the 448-mg group discontinued because of adverse events. The most frequent adverse events were diarrhea and vomiting. Conclusions and Relevance: Edonerpic maleate appeared to be safe and tolerable, with expected gastrointestinal symptoms occurring early but without evidence for a clinical effect among patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.

    "abstract": "Advances in the understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest that pathogenesis is not directly related to plaque burden, but rather to soluble toxic amyloid-beta oligomers (AssO). Therapeutic antibodies targeting Ass monomers and/or plaque have shown limited efficacy and dose-limiting adverse events in clinical trials. These findings suggest that antibodies capable of selectively neutralizing toxic AssO may achieve improved efficacy and safety. To this end, we generated monoclonal antibodies against a conformational Ass epitope predicted by computational modeling to be presented on toxic AssO but not monomers or fibrils. The resulting lead antibody, PMN310, showed the desired AssO-selective binding profile. In vitro, PMN310 inhibited AssO propagation and toxicity. In vivo, PMN310 prevented AssO-induced loss of memory formation and reduced synaptic loss and inflammation. A humanized version (huPMN310) compared favorably to other Ass-directed antibodies showing a lack of adverse event-associated binding to Ass deposits in AD brains, and greater selective binding to AssO-enriched AD brain fractions that contain synaptotoxic Ass species. Systemic administration of huPMN310 in mice resulted in brain exposure and kinetics comparable to those of other therapeutic human monoclonal antibodies. Greater selectivity for AssO and the potential to safely administer high doses of huPMN310 are expected to result in enhanced safety and therapeutic potency.",

The kinetics of aggregation of Abeta1-42 are delayed dramatically in the presence of substoichiometric, nanomolar concentrations of N-terminal fragment (NTF), C-terminal fragment (CTF) and full-length apoE both in lipid-free and in lipidated forms. However, interactions between apoE and Abeta as measured by intermolecular Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis were found to be minimal at t = 0 but to increase in a time-dependent manner. Thus, apoE must interact with one or more 'intermediates' rather than the monomers of Abeta. Kinetics of FRET between full-length apoE4 labelled with EDANS at position 62 or 139 or 210 or 247 or 276, and tetramethylrhodamine-labelled Abeta (TMR-Abeta), further support an involvement of all the three domains of apoE in the interactions. However, the above-mentioned residues do not appear to form a single pocket in the 3-dimensional structure of apoE. A competitive binding assay examining the effects of unlabelled fragments or full-length apoE on the FRET between EDANS-apoE and TMR-Abeta show that binding affinity of the full-length apoE to Abeta is much higher than that of the fragments. Furthermore, apoE4 is found to interact more strongly than apoE3. We hypothesize that high affinity of the apoE-Abeta interaction is attained due to multivalent binding mediated by multiple interactions between oligomeric Abeta and full-length apoE.",

    "title": "Determining clinically meaningful decline in preclinical Alzheimer disease.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the time required for a preclinical Alzheimer disease population to decline in a meaningful way, use estimates of decline to update previous clinical trial design assumptions, and identify factors that modify beta-amyloid (Abeta)-related decline. METHODS: In 1,120 cognitively unimpaired individuals from 3 international cohorts, we estimated the relationship between Abeta status and longitudinal changes across multiple cognitive domains and assessed interactions between Abeta and baseline factors. Power analyses were performed to explore sample size as a function of treatment effect. RESULTS: Cognitively unimpaired Abeta+ participants approach mild cognitive impairment (MCI) levels of performance 6 years after baseline, on average. Achieving 80% power in a simulated 4-year treatment trial, assuming a 25% treatment effect, required 2,000 participants/group. Multiple factors interacted with Abeta to predict cognitive decline; however, these findings were all cohort-specific. Despite design differences across the cohorts, with large sample sizes and sufficient follow-up time, the Abeta+ groups declined consistently on cognitive composite measures. CONCLUSIONS: A preclinical AD population declines to the cognitive performance of an early MCI population in 6 years. Slowing this rate of decline by 40%-50% delays clinically relevant impairment by 3 years-a potentially meaningful treatment effect. However, assuming a 40%-50% drug effect highlights the difficulties in preclinical AD trial design, as a more commonly assumed treatment effect of 25% results in a required sample size of 2,000/group. Designers of preclinical AD treatment trials need to prepare for larger and longer trials than are currently being considered. Interactions with Abeta status were inconsistent and not readily generalizable.",

    "title": "The role of PTB domain containing adaptor proteins on PICALM-mediated APP endocytosis and localization.",
    "abstract": "One hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the presence of amyloid plaques, which mainly consist of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage product amyloid beta (Abeta). For cleavage to occur, the APP must be endocytosed from the cell surface. The phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) is involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and polymorphisms in and near the gene locus were identified as genetic risk factors for AD. PICALM overexpression enhances APP internalization and Abeta production. Furthermore, PICALM shuttles into the nucleus, but its function within the nucleus is still unknown. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated an interaction between PICALM and APP, which is abrogated by mutation of the APP NPXY-motif. Since the NPXY-motif is an internalization signal that binds to phosphotryrosine-binding domain-containing adaptor proteins (PTB-APs), we hypothesized that PTB-APs can modulate the APP-PICALM interaction. We found that interaction between PICALM and the PTB-APs (Numb, JIP1b and GULP1) enhances the APP-PICALM interaction. Fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis and internalization assays revealed differentially altered APP cell surface levels and endocytosis rates that depended upon the presence of PICALM and co-expression of distinct PTB-APs. Additionally, we were able to show an impact of PICALM nuclear shuttling upon co-expression of PTB-APs and PICALM, with the magnitude of the effect depending on which PTB-AP was co-expressed. Taken together, our results indicate a modulating effect of PTB-APs on PICALM-mediated APP endocytosis and localization.",

No drug designs seem to be working in humans, apparently because the origins of AD have not been identified. Invoking amyloid cascade, metal ions, and ROS production hypothesis of AD, herein we share our point of view on Cu(II) binding properties of Abeta4-x, the most prevalent N-truncated Abeta peptide, currently known as the main constituent of amyloid plaques. The capability of Abeta4-x to rapidly take over copper from previously tested Abeta1-x peptides and form highly stable complexes, redox unreactive and resistant to copper exchange reactions, prompted us to propose physiological roles for these peptides. We discuss the new findings on the reactivity of Cu(II)Abeta4-x with coexisting biomolecules in the context of synaptic cleft; we suggest that the role of Abeta4-x peptides is to quench Cu(II) toxicity in the brain and maintain neurotransmission.",

    "title": "Effects of Amylin Against Amyloid-beta-Induced Tauopathy and Synapse Loss in Primary Neurons.",
    "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrate that peripheral amylin treatment reduces pathology in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, soluble and aggregated amylin are distinct species; while amylin is a physiological neuropeptide, amylin aggregation is a pathological factor for diabetes. We thus hypothesized that because of their similarity in secondary structures, amylin antagonizes amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta)-induced AD pathology in neurons with a dose-dependent pattern. To test the hypothesis, we conducted both in vitro and in vivo experiments with different doses of amylin and with its analog, pramlintide. Here we report that a high concentration of either Abeta or amylin alone induced tau phosphorylation (pTau) in primary neurons. Interestingly, with a low concentration, amylin had direct effects to reverse the Abeta-induced pTau, as well as damaged neuronal synapses and neurite disorganization. However, when the concentration was high (10.24 muM), amylin lost the effects against the Abeta-induced cellular AD pathology and, together with Abeta, worsened tauopathy in neurons. In the 5XFAD AD mouse model, daily peripheral amylin treatment with a low dose (200 mug/kg) more effectively reduced amyloid burden, and increased synapse, but with a high dose (800 mug/kg), it more effectively reduced tauopathy. Correspondingly, amylin treatment improved learning and memory in these mice. It demonstrates that amylin has a dose-dependent U-shape effect against AD pathogenesis. Within a physiological range, amylin is a neuroprotective hormone against AD in neurons; but when both Abeta and amylin concentrations are elevated, imbalance of Abeta and amylin may contribute to brain AD pathogenesis.",

Partial helical structures of Abeta1-40 induced by low solvent polarity accelerated cytotoxic Abeta1-40 amyloid fibrillation, while predominantly helical folds did not aggregate. Changes in the solvent polarity caused a rapid formation of beta-structure-rich protofibrils or oligomers via aggregation-prone helical structures. Modulation of the pH and salt concentration transformed oligomers to protofibrils, which proceeded to amyloid formation. We reveal diverse molecular mechanisms underlying Abeta1-40 aggregation with conceptual energy diagrams and propose that aggregation-prone partial helical structures are key to inducing amyloidogenesis. We demonstrate that context-dependent protein aggregation is comprehensively understood using the macroscopic phase diagram, which provides general insights into differentiation of amyloid formation and phase separation from unfolded and folded structures.",

    "title": "Associations of Physical Activity and beta-Amyloid With Longitudinal Cognition and Neurodegeneration in Clinically Normal Older Adults.",
    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: In the absence of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer disease, there is a critical need to identify modifiable risk factors that may delay the progression of Alzheimer disease. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether physical activity moderates the association of beta-amyloid (Abeta) burden with longitudinal cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in clinically normal individuals and to examine whether these associations are independent of vascular risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal observational study included clinically normal participants from the Harvard Aging Brain Study. Participants were required to have baseline Abeta positron emission tomography data, baseline medical data to quantify vascular risk, and longitudinal neuropsychological and structural magnetic resonance imaging data. Data were collected from April 2010 to June 2018. Data were analyzed from August to December 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Baseline physical activity was quantified with a pedometer (mean steps per day). Baseline Abeta burden was measured with carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography. Cognition was measured annually with the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC; median [interquartile range] follow-up, 6.0 [4.3-6.3] years). Neurodegeneration was assessed with longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging (2 to 5 scans per participant; median [interquartile range] follow-up, 4.5 [3.0-5.0] years), with a focus on total gray matter volume and regional cortical thickness. Physical activity and Abeta burden were examined as interactive predictors of PACC decline and volume loss in separate linear mixed models, adjusting for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E epsilon4 status, and, where appropriate, intracranial volume. Secondary models adjusted for vascular risk and its interaction with Abeta burden. RESULTS: Of the 182 included participants, 103 (56.6%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 73.4 (6.2) years. In models examining PACC decline and volume loss, there was a significant interaction of physical activity with Abeta burden, such that greater physical activity was associated with slower Abeta-related cognitive decline (beta, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.02-0.05; P < .001) and volume loss (beta, 482.07; 95% CI, 189.40-774.74; P = .002). Adjusting for vascular risk did not alter these associations. In these models, lower vascular risk was independently associated with slower Abeta-related PACC decline (beta, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.06 to -0.02; P < .001) and volume loss (beta, -483.41; 95% CI, -855.63 to -111.20; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Greater physical activity and lower vascular risk independently attenuated the negative association of Abeta burden with cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in asymptomatic individuals. These findings suggest that engaging in physical activity and lowering vascular risk may have additive protective effects on delaying the progression of Alzheimer disease.",

    "title": "Preventing dementia by preventing stroke: The Berlin Manifesto.",
    "abstract": "The incidence of stroke and dementia are diverging across the world, rising for those in low- and middle-income countries and falling in those in high-income countries. This suggests that whatever factors cause these trends are potentially modifiable. At the population level, neurological disorders as a group account for the largest proportion of disability-adjusted life years globally (10%). Among neurological disorders, stroke (42%) and dementia (10%) dominate. Stroke and dementia confer risks for each other and share some of the same, largely modifiable, risk and protective factors. In principle, 90% of strokes and 35% of dementias have been estimated to be preventable. Because a stroke doubles the chance of developing dementia and stroke is more common than dementia, more than a third of dementias could be prevented by preventing stroke. Developments at the pathological, pathophysiological, and clinical level also point to new directions. Growing understanding of brain pathophysiology has unveiled the reciprocal interaction of cerebrovascular disease and neurodegeneration identifying new therapeutic targets to include protection of the endothelium, the blood-brain barrier, and other components of the neurovascular unit. In addition, targeting amyloid angiopathy aspects of inflammation and genetic manipulation hold new testable promise. In the meantime, accumulating evidence suggests that whole populations experiencing improved education, and lower vascular risk factor profiles (e.g., reduced prevalence of smoking) and vascular disease, including stroke, have better cognitive function and lower dementia rates. At the individual levels, trials have demonstrated that anticoagulation of atrial fibrillation can reduce the risk of dementia by 48% and that systolic blood pressure lower than 140 mmHg may be better for the brain. Based on these considerations, the World Stroke Organization has issued a proclamation, endorsed by all the major international organizations focused on global brain and cardiovascular health, calling for the joint prevention of stroke and dementia. This article summarizes the evidence for translation into action.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta, Abeta(1-42), is a component of senile plaques present in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients and one of the main suspects responsible for pathological consequences of the disease. Herein, we directly visualize the Abeta activity toward a brain-like model membrane and demonstrate that this activity strongly depends on the Abeta oligomer size. PeakForce quantitative nanomechanical mapping mode of atomic force microscopy imaging revealed that the interaction of large-size (LS) Abeta oligomers, corresponding to high-molecular-weight Abeta oligomers, with the brain total lipid extract (BTLE) membrane resulted in accelerated Abeta fibrillogenesis on the membrane surface. Importantly, the fibrillogenesis did not affect integrity of the membrane. In contrast, small-size (SS) Abeta oligomers, corresponding to low-molecular-weight Abeta oligomers, created pores and then disintegrated the BTLE membrane. Both forms of the Abeta oligomers changed nanomechanical properties of the membrane by decreasing its Young's modulus by ~45%. Our results demonstrated that both forms of Abeta oligomers induce the neurotoxic effect on the brain cells but their action toward the membrane differs significantly.",

    "abstract": "We employed dielectrophoresis to a yeast cell suspension containing amyloid-beta proteins (Abeta) in a microfluidic environment. The Abeta was separated from the cells and characterized using the gradual dissolution of Abeta as a function of the applied dielectrophoretic parameters. We established the gradual dissolution of Abeta under specific dielectrophoretic parameters. Further, Abeta in the fibril form at the tip of the electrode dissolved at high frequency. This was perhaps due to the conductivity of the suspending medium changing according to the frequency, which resulted in a higher temperature at the tips of the electrodes, and consequently in the breakdown of the hydrogen bonds. However, those shaped as spheroidal monomers experienced a delay in the Abeta fibril transformation process. Yeast cells exposed to relatively low temperatures at the base of the electrode did not experience a positive or negative change in viability. The DEP microfluidic platform incorporating the integrated microtip electrode array was able to selectively manipulate the yeast cells and dissolve the Abeta to a controlled extent. We demonstrate suitable dielectrophoretic parameters to induce such manipulation, which is highly relevant for Abeta-related colloidal microfluidic research and could be applied to Alzheimer's research in the future.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Amyloid (Abeta) brain deposition can occur in cognitively normal individuals and is associated with cortical volume abnormalities. Abeta-related volume changes are inconsistent across studies. Since volume is composed of surface area and thickness, the relative contribution of Abeta deposition on each of these metrics remains to be understood in cognitively normal individuals. METHODS: A group of 104 cognitively normal individuals underwent neuropsychological assessment, PiB-PET scan, and MRI acquisition. Surface-based cortical analyses were performed to investigate the effects of cortical and subcortical Abeta burden on cortical volume, thickness, and surface area. Mediation analyses were used to study the effect of thickness and surface area on Abeta-associated volume changes. We also investigated the relationships between structural metrics in clusters with abnormal morphology and regions underlying resting-state functional networks and cognitive performance. RESULTS: Cortical Abeta was not associated with cortical morphology. Subcortical Abeta burden was associated with changes in cortical volume, thickness, and surface area. Abeta-associated volume changes were driven by cortical surface area with or without thickness but never by thickness alone. Abeta-associated changes overlapped greatly with regions from the default mode network and were associated with lower performance in visuospatial abilities, episodic memory, and working memory. CONCLUSIONS: In cognitively normal individuals, subcortical Abeta is associated with cortical volume, and this effect was driven by surface area with or without thickness. Abeta-associated cortical changes were found in the default mode network and affected cognitive performance. Our findings demonstrate the importance of studying subcortical Abeta and cortical surface area in normal ageing.",

METHODS: The data set included 57 baseline F-florbetapir (Amyvid; Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) brain PET scans in participants with severe white matter disease, presenting with either transient ischemic attack/lacunar stroke or mild cognitive impairment from early Alzheimer disease, enrolled in a multicenter prospective observational trial. Scans were processed using the MINC toolkit to generate SUV ratios, normalized to cerebellar gray matter, and clinically read by 2 nuclear medicine physicians with interpretation based on consensus (35 negative, 22 positive). SUV ratio data and clinical reads were used for supervised training of an RF classifier programmed in MATLAB. RESULTS: A 10,000-tree RF, each tree using 15 randomly selected cases and 20 randomly selected features (SUV ratio per region of interest), with 37 cases for training and 20 cases for testing, had sensitivity = 86% (95% confidence interval [CI], 42%-100%), specificity = 92% (CI, 64%-100%), and classification accuracy = 90% (CI, 68%-99%). The most common features at the root node (key regions for stratification) were (1) left posterior cingulate (1039 trees), (2) left middle frontal gyrus (1038 trees), (3) left precuneus (857 trees), (4) right anterior cingulate gyrus (655 trees), and (5) right posterior cingulate (588 trees).

METHODS: Negative binomial (NB) regressions were performed using gene expression data accrued from a single population of CA1 pyramidal neurons and regional hippocampal dissections obtained from participants in the Rush Religious Orders Study (RROS). RESULTS: Downregulation of Bdnf is independently associated with increased entorhinal cortex NPs. Downregulation of TrkB is independently associated with increased entorhinal cortex NFTs and CA1 NPs during the progression of AD. DISCUSSION: Results indicate that BDNF and TrkB dysregulation contribute to AD neuropathology, most notably hippocampal NPs and NFTs. These data suggest attenuating BDNF/TrkB signaling deficits either at the level of BDNF, TrkB, or downstream of TrkB signaling may abrogate NPs and/or NFTs.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need to understand the relationships between amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau in the progression of Alzheimer's disease to identify treatment targets. Here we examine reciprocal predictions of brain Abeta burden quantified by positron emission tomography and CSF concentrations of Abeta42 and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). Each biomarker was examined over 48 months in two separate cross-lagged models; one in asymptomatic healthy elderly people (men and women), and one in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The models examine predictions of each biomarker on the progression of the others, considering each previous and concurrent measure. In healthy elderly, lower CSF Abeta42 predicted Abeta deposition and reciprocally, Abeta burden predicted a decrease in CSF Abeta42. Lower CSF Abeta42 predicted an increase in CSF p-tau, and CSF p-tau predicted Abeta deposition. In AD/MCI, lower CSF Abeta42 predicted Abeta deposition and Abeta burden reciprocally predicted CSF Abeta42 changes; however, in contrast to healthy elderly, CSF p-tau concentrations did not predict Abeta biomarkers, or vice versa. In post hoc models examining cognitive status, CSF Abeta42 predicted Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in healthy elderly, whereas Abeta burden and CSF p-tau predicted MMSE scores in AD/MCI. The findings describe reciprocal predictions between Abeta and tau biomarkers in healthy elderly and they implicate mechanisms underlying low CSF Abeta42 in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and progression. In symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, CSF Abeta42 and Abeta deposition predicted each other; however, Abeta and CSF p-tau progressed independently and they independently predicted cognitive decline.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This study offers empirical evidence concerning the hypothesized \"amyloid cascade\", as it progressed over 4 years in healthy elderly people and in Alzheimer's disease patients. In healthy elderly, CSF amyloid changes predicted amyloid deposition, CSF phosphorylated tau concentrations, and a decline in cognitive status. Phosphorylated tau concentrations specifically predicted amyloid deposition. In Alzheimer's disease patients, although amyloid deposition and CSF amyloid changes continued to \"cascade\", there was no evidence to suggest that amyloid and tau biomarkers predicted each other, although both amyloid deposition and CSF tau progression predicted cognitive decline independently. Taking advantage of repeated amyloid PET and CSF measures, this dynamic view offers new insight into the progression of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and their relationships with cognitive decline.",

Here we present the 1.1 A resolution MicroED structure of an Abeta 20-34 fibril with and without the disease-associated PTM, L-isoaspartate, at position 23 (L-isoAsp23). Both wild-type and L-isoAsp23 protofilaments adopt beta-helix-like folds with tightly packed cores, resembling the cores of full-length fibrillar Abeta structures, and both self-associate through two distinct interfaces. One of these is a unique Abeta interface strengthened by the isoaspartyl modification. Powder diffraction patterns suggest a similar structure may be adopted by protofilaments of an analogous segment containing the heritable Iowa mutation, Asp23Asn. Consistent with its early onset phenotype in patients, Asp23Asn accelerates aggregation of Abeta 20-34, as does the L-isoAsp23 modification. These structures suggest that the enhanced amyloidogenicity of the modified Abeta segments may also reduce the concentration required to achieve nucleation and therefore help spur the pathogenesis of AD.",

    "abstract": "Misfolding of the microtubule-binding protein tau into filamentous aggregates is characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. Determining the structures and dynamics of these tau fibrils is important for designing inhibitors against tau aggregation. Tau fibrils obtained from patient brains have been found by cryo-electron microscopy to adopt disease-specific molecular conformations. However, in vitro heparin-fibrillized 2N4R tau, which contains all four microtubule-binding repeats (4R), was recently found to adopt polymorphic structures. Here we use solid-state NMR spectroscopy to investigate the global fold and dynamics of heparin-fibrillized 0N4R tau. A single set of 13C and 15N chemical shifts was observed for residues in the four repeats, indicating a single beta-sheet conformation for the fibril core. This rigid core spans the R2 and R3 repeats and adopts a hairpin-like fold that has similarities to but also clear differences from any of the polymorphic 2N4R folds. Obtaining a homogeneous fibril sample required careful purification of the protein and removal of any proteolytic fragments. A variety of experiments and polarization transfer from water and mobile side chains indicate that 0N4R tau fibrils exhibit heterogeneous dynamics: Outside the rigid R2-R3 core, the R1 and R4 repeats are semirigid even though they exhibit beta-strand character and the proline-rich domains undergo large-amplitude anisotropic motions, whereas the two termini are nearly isotropically flexible. These results have significant implications for the structure and dynamics of 4R tau fibrils in vivo.",

Neuroinflammation has emerged as an additional pathological component. Microglia, representing the brain's major innate immune cells, play an important role during Alzheimer's. Once activated, microglia show changes in their morphology, characterized by a retraction of cell processes. Systemic inflammation is known to increase the risk for cognitive decline in human neurogenerative diseases including Alzheimer's. Here, we assess for the first time microglial changes upon a peripheral immune challenge in the context of aging and Alzheimer's in vivo, using 2-photon laser scanning microscopy. Microglia were monitored at 2 and 10 days post-challenge by lipopolysaccharide. Microglia exhibited a reduction in the number of branches and the area covered at 2 days, a phenomenon that resolved at 10 days. Systemic inflammation reduced microglial clearance of amyloid-beta in APP/PS1 mice. NLRP3 inflammasome knockout blocked many of the observed microglial changes upon lipopolysaccharide, including alterations in microglial morphology and amyloid pathology. NLRP3 inhibition may thus represent a novel therapeutic target that may protect the brain from toxic peripheral inflammation during systemic infection.",

However, the current knowledge about the molecular determinants of Abeta n toxicity is at best scant. Here, we comparatively analyze Abeta n prepared in the absence or presence of a catechin library that modulates cellular toxicity. By combining solution NMR with dynamic light scattering, fluorescence spectroscopy, electron microscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction and cell viability assays, we identify a cluster of unique molecular signatures that distinguish toxic vs. nontoxic Abeta assemblies. These include the exposure of a hydrophobic surface spanning residues 17-28 and the concurrent shielding of the highly charged N-terminus. We show that the combination of these two dichotomous structural transitions promotes the colocalization and insertion of beta-sheet rich Abeta n into the membrane, compromising membrane integrity. These previously elusive toxic surfaces mapped here provide an unprecedented foundation to establish structure-toxicity relationships of Abeta assemblies.",

    "abstract": "Proteolysis of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a promising approach against Alzheimer's disease. However, it is not feasible to employ natural hydrolases directly because of their cumbersome preparation and purification, poor stability, and hazardous immunogenicity. Therefore, artificial enzymes have been developed as potential alternatives to natural hydrolases. Since specific cleavage sites of Abeta are usually embedded inside the beta-sheet structures that restrict access by artificial enzymes, this strongly hinders their efficiency for practical applications. Herein, we construct a NIR (near-IR) controllable artificial metalloprotease (MoS2 -Co) using a molybdenum disulfide nanosheet (MoS2 ) and a cobalt complex of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (Codota). Evidenced by detailed experimental and theoretical studies, the NIR-enhanced MoS2 -Co can circumvent the restriction by simultaneously inhibition of beta-sheet formation and destroying beta-sheet structures of the preformed Abeta aggregates in living cell. Furthermore, our designed MoS2 -Co is an easy to graft Abeta-target agent that prevents misdirected or undesirable hydrolysis reactions, and has been demonstrated to cross the blood brain barrier. This method can be adapted for hydrolysis of other kinds of amyloids.",

    "abstract": "Despite years of intensive research, little is known about oligomeric structures present during Alzheimer's disease (AD). Excess of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides and their aggregation are the basis of the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which attempts to explain the causes of AD. Because of the intrinsically disordered nature of Abeta monomers and the high aggregation rate of oligomers, their structures are almost impossible to resolve using experimental methods. For this reason, we used a physics-based coarse-grained force field to extensively search for the conformational space of the Abeta42 tetramer, which is believed to be the smallest stable Abeta oligomer and the most toxic one. The resulting structures were subsequently optimized, tested for stability, and compared with the proposed experimental fibril models, using molecular dynamics simulations in two popular all-atom force fields. Our results show that the Abeta42 tetramer can form polymorphic stable structures, which may explain different pathways of Abeta aggregation. The models obtained comprise the outer and core chains and, therefore, are significantly different from the structure of mature fibrils. We found that interaction with water is the reason why the tetramer is more compact and less dry inside than fibrils. Physicochemical properties of the proposed all-atom structures are consistent with the available experimental observations and theoretical expectations. Therefore, we provide possible models for further study and design of higher order oligomers.",

    "title": "Visual paired associate learning deficits associated with elevated beta-amyloid in cognitively normal older adults.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have shown that paired associate learning (PAL), a type of episodic memory, is impaired in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Such tasks require that a set of associations (e.g., pattern-location) be learned over several trials, and the objective is to reduce errors with each trial. Currently, the nature and magnitude of impairment and decline on PAL measures in cognitively normal (CN) older adults with elevated levels of beta-amyloid (Abeta+) is unknown. METHOD: This study examined PAL errors in Abeta+ and Abeta - CN older adults, both within a single assessment and over time. Participants (210 Abeta - CN, 146 Abeta + CN) from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle (AIBL) study underwent three assessments over 36-months (baseline, and 18- and 36-month follow-ups) using a computerized paired associate learning task (CPAL). Abeta status was determined by positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging. RESULTS: No significant group differences in PAL were evident at baseline. Significant groupxtime interactions were observed, with the Abeta - CN group, but not the Abeta + CN group, evidencing improvement over time (Cohen's d = 0.30 [0.08, 0.51]). Despite this, no group differences were evident at 36-months. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that PAL dysfunction is evident over time in Abeta + CNs. This indicates a lack of benefit from repeated exposure to the task over time associated with Abeta+, which is not the case for Abeta - CNs. Further, results suggest that assessing change in Abeta+ related cognition over time, rather than at a single assessment, provides greater understanding of dysfunction in early AD.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We examined whether plasma beta-amyloid (Abeta)42/Abeta40, as measured by a high-precision assay, accurately diagnosed brain amyloidosis using amyloid PET or CSF p-tau181/Abeta42 as reference standards. METHODS: Using an immunoprecipitation and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay, we measured Abeta42/Abeta40 in plasma and CSF samples from 158 mostly cognitively normal individuals that were collected within 18 months of an amyloid PET scan. RESULTS: Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 had a high correspondence with amyloid PET status (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve [AUC] 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82-0.93) and CSF p-tau181/Abeta42 (AUC 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.92). The combination of plasma Abeta42/Abeta40, age, and APOE epsilon4 status had a very high correspondence with amyloid PET (AUC 0.94, 95% CI 0.90-0.97). Individuals with a negative amyloid PET scan at baseline and a positive plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 (<0.1218) had a 15-fold greater risk of conversion to amyloid PET-positive compared to individuals with a negative plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40, especially when combined with age and APOE epsilon4 status, accurately diagnoses brain amyloidosis and can be used to screen cognitively normal individuals for brain amyloidosis. Individuals with a negative amyloid PET scan and positive plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 are at increased risk for converting to amyloid PET-positive. Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 could be used in prevention trials to screen for individuals likely to be amyloid PET-positive and at risk for Alzheimer disease dementia. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 levels accurately determine amyloid PET status in cognitively normal research participants.",

    "abstract": "The presence of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques in the brain of some individuals with Creutzfeldt-Jakob or Gertsmann-Straussler-Scheinker diseases suggests that pathogenic prions (PrPSc) would have stimulated the production and deposition of Abeta peptides. We here show in prion-infected neurons and mice that deregulation of the PDK1-TACE alpha-secretase pathway reduces the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) alpha-cleavage in favor of APP beta-processing, leading to Abeta40/42 accumulation. Abeta predominates as monomers, but is also found as trimers and tetramers. Prion-induced Abeta peptides do not affect prion replication and infectivity, but display seedable properties as they can deposit in the mouse brain only when seeds of Abeta trimers are co-transmitted with PrPSc. Importantly, brain Abeta deposition accelerates death of prion-infected mice. Our data stress that PrPSc, through deregulation of the PDK1-TACE-APP pathway, provokes the accumulation of Abeta, a prerequisite for the onset of an Abeta seeds-induced Abeta pathology within a prion-infectious context.",

    "abstract": "The independent effects of different brain pathologies on age-dependent cognitive decline are unclear. We examined this in 300 cognitively unimpaired elderly individuals from the BioFINDER study. Using cognition as outcome we studied the effects of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for amyloid-beta (Abeta42/40), neuroinflammation (YKL-40), and neurodegeneration and tau pathology (T-tau and P-tau) as well as MRI measures of white-matter lesions, hippocampal volume (HV), and regional cortical thickness. We found that Abeta positivity and HV were independently associated with memory. Results differed depending on age, with memory being associated with HV (but not Abeta) in older participants (73.3-88.4 years), and with Abeta (but not HV) in relatively younger participants (65.2-73.2 years). This indicates that Abeta and atrophy are independent contributors to memory variability in cognitively healthy elderly and that Abeta mainly affects memory in younger elderly individuals. With advancing age, the effect of brain atrophy overshadows the effect of Abeta on memory function.",

    "abstract": "It may be possible to classify patients with Abeta positive (+) mild cognitive impairment (MCI) into fast and slow decliners according to their biomarker status. In this study, we aimed to develop a risk prediction model to predict fast decline in the Abeta+ MCI population using multimodal biomarkers. We included 186 Abeta+ MCI patients who underwent florbetapir PET, brain MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses, and FDG PET at baseline. We defined conversion to dementia within 3 years (= fast decline) as the outcome. The associations of potential covariates (MCI stage, APOE4 genotype, corrected hippocampal volume (HV), FDG PET SUVR, AV45 PET SUVR, CSF Abeta, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau)) with the outcome were tested and nomograms were constructed using logistic regression models in the training dataset (n=124, n of fast decliners=52). The model was internally validated with the testing dataset (n=62, n of fast decliners=22). The multivariable analysis (including CSF t-tau) showed that MCI stage (late MCI vs. early MCI; OR 15.88, 95% CI 4.59, 54.88), APOE4 (OR 5.65, 95% CI 1.52, 20.98), corrected HV*1000 (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.09, 0.57), FDG SUVR*10 (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27, 0.71), and loge CSF t-tau (OR 6.20, 95% CI 1.48, 25.96) were associated with being fast decliners. In the second model including CSF p-tau instead of t-tau, the above associations remained the same, with a significant association between loge CSF p-tau (OR 4.53, 95% CI 1.26, 16.31) and fast decline. The constructed nomograms showed excellent predictive performance (90%) on validation with the testing dataset. Among Abeta+ MCI patients, our findings suggested that multimodal AD biomarkers are significantly associated with being classified as fast decliners. A nomogram incorporating these biomarkers might be useful in early treatment decisions or stratified enrollment of this population into clinical trials.",

We investigated the associations between such factors, longitudinal AD cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and cognition. METHODS: 433 cognitively normal participants were classified into four biomarker groups using their baseline amyloid (A+/-) and tau status (T+/-). 184 participants had undergone serial cerebrospinal fluid collection. Frequencies of risk factors and the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) were compared, and we tested the influence of risk factors on change in biomarker concentrations and cognition. RESULTS: The absence of obesity, presence of hypertension, and a high FRS were associated with an increase in tau levels, particularly in A+T+ individuals. Risk factors were not associated with amyloid. Depression was associated with higher cognitive scores, whereas high FRS was associated with lower scores and a faster decline. DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrate that vascular risk factors may enhance neurodegeneration but not amyloid accumulation in preclinical AD.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported that Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) infection of cultured neurons triggered intracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) markedly impinging on neuronal functions. Here, we demonstrated that HSV-1 affects in vitro and in vivo adult hippocampal neurogenesis by reducing neural stem/progenitor cell (NSC) proliferation and their neuronal differentiation via intracellular Abeta accumulation. Specifically, cultured NSCs were more permissive for HSV-1 replication than mature neurons and, once infected, they exhibited reduced proliferation (assessed by 5'-bromo-deoxyuridine incorporation, Ki67 immunoreactivity, and Sox2 mRNA expression) and impaired neuronal differentiation in favor of glial phenotype (evaluated by immunoreactivity for the neuronal marker MAP2, the glial marker glial fibrillary astrocyte protein, and the expression of the proneuronal genes Mash1 and NeuroD1). Similarly, impaired adult neurogenesis was observed in the subgranular zone of hippocampal dentate gyrus of an in vivo model of recurrent HSV-1 infections, that we recently set up and characterized, with respect to mock-infected mice. The effects of HSV-1 on neurogenesis did not depend on cell death and were due to Abeta accumulation in infected NSCs. Indeed, they were: (a) reverted, in vitro, by the presence of either beta/gamma-secretase inhibitors preventing Abeta production or the specific 4G8 antibody counteracting the action of intracellular Abeta; (b) not detectable, in vivo, in HSV-1-infected amyloid precursor protein knockout mice, unable to produce and accumulate Abeta. Given the critical role played by adult neurogenesis in hippocampal-dependent memory and learning, our results suggest that multiple virus reactivations in the brain may contribute to Alzheimer's disease phenotype by also targeting NSCs.

    "abstract": "Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are at high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Discovering reliable biomarkers which could facilitate early AD diagnosis and be used to predict/monitor disease course would be extremely valuable. To examine if analytes in blood related to amyloid plaques may constitute such biomarkers, we conducted meta-analyses of studies comparing plasma amyloid beta (Abeta) levels between DS individuals and controls, and between DS individuals with and without dementia. PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched for studies investigating the relationship between Abeta plasma concentrations and dementia in DS and 10 studies collectively comprising >1,600 adults, including >1,400 individuals with DS, were included. RevMan 5.3 was used to perform meta-analyses. Meta-analyses showed higher plasma Abeta40 (SMD = 1.79, 95% CI [1.14, 2.44], Z = 5.40, p < .00001) and plasma Abeta42 levels (SMD = 1.41, 95% CI [1.15, 1.68], Z = 10.46, p < .00001) in DS individuals than controls, and revealed that DS individuals with dementia had higher plasma Abeta40 levels (SMD = 0.23, 95% CI [0.05, 0.41], Z = 2.54, p = .01) and lower Abeta42 /Abeta40 ratios (SMD = -0.33, 95% CI [-0.63, -0.03], Z = 2.15, p = .03) than DS individuals without dementia. Our results indicate that plasma Abeta40 levels may constitute a promising biomarker for predicting dementia status in individuals with DS. Further investigations using new ultra-sensitive assays are required to obtain more reliable results and to investigate to what extent these results may be generalizable beyond the DS population.",

    "title": "Blood-based biomarkers for Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS) occurs due to triplication of chromosome 21. Individuals with DS face an elevated risk for development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to increased amyloid beta (Abeta) resulting from the over-expression of the amyloid precursor protein found on chromosome 21. Diagnosis of AD among individuals with DS poses particular challenges resulting in an increased focus on alternative diagnostic methods such as blood-based biomarkers. The aim of this review was to evaluate the current state of the literature of blood-based biomarkers found in individuals with DS and particularly among those also diagnosed with AD or in prodromal stages (mild cognitive impairment [MCI]). A systematic review was conducted utilizing a comprehensive search strategy. Twenty-four references were identified, of those, 22 fulfilled inclusion criteria were selected for further analysis with restriction to only plasma-based biomarkers. Studies found Abeta to be consistently higher among individuals with DS; however, the link between Abeta peptides (Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40) and AD among DS was inconsistent. Inflammatory-based proteins were more reliably found to be elevated leading to preliminary work focused on an algorithmic approach with predominantly inflammatory-based proteins to detect AD and MCI as well as predict risk of incidence among DS. Separate work has also shown remarkable diagnostic accuracy with the use of a single protein (NfL) as compared to combined proteomic profiles. This review serves to outline the current state of the literature and highlights the potential plasma-based biomarkers for use in detecting AD and MCI among this at-risk population.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) are a key pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau phosphorylation is suggested to be secondary to amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation. However, the mechanism by which Abeta induces tau phosphorylation in neurons remains unclear. Neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR) is a receptor for Abeta and mediates Abeta neurotoxicity, implying that p75NTR may mediate Abeta-induced tau phosphorylation in AD. Here, we showed that Abeta-induced tau hyperphosphorylation and neurodegeneration, including tau phosphorylation, synaptic disorder and neuronal loss, in the brains of both male wild-type (Wt) mice and male P301L transgenic mice (a mouse model of human tauopathy) were alleviated by genetic knockout of p75NTR in the both mouse models. We further confirmed that the activation or inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) significantly changed Abeta/p75NTR-mediated p-tau levels in neurons. Treatment of male P301L mice with soluble p75NTR extracellular domain (p75ECD-Fc), which antagonizes the binding of Abeta to p75NTR, suppressed tau hyperphosphorylation. Taken together, our findings suggest that p75NTR meditates Abeta-induced tau pathology and is a potential druggable target for AD and other tauopathies.",

Although experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis continues to accrue, the underlying pathological mechanisms are not well understood. In this experiment, we used mouse models of Abeta-amyloidosis to show that hyperactivation is initiated by the suppression of glutamate reuptake. Hyperactivity occurred in neurons with preexisting baseline activity, whereas inactive neurons were generally resistant to Abeta-mediated hyperactivation. Abeta-containing AD brain extracts and purified Abeta dimers were able to sustain this vicious cycle. Our findings suggest a cellular mechanism of Abeta-dependent neuronal dysfunction that can be active before plaque formation.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In cognitively healthy older adults, amyloid-beta (Abeta) burden is associated with greater activity on task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging. Higher levels of functional activation are associated with other factors along with amyloid and the authors investigated these relationships as well as how they relate to Abeta in cognitively healthy older adults. METHODS: The authors recruited cognitive healthy older adults (N = 50) from the Pittsburgh community that underwent extensive cognitive batteries, activation during a working memory (digit symbol substitution task, DSST), positron emission tomography scan for Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB, measuring amyloid), and other demographic measures. The authors tested the association between DSST activation and global PiB, neurocognitive batteries, and education. RESULTS: The authors found that the DSST robustly activated expected structures involved in working memory. The authors found that greater global Abeta deposition was associated with greater DSST activation in the right calcarine, precuneus, middle temporal as well as the left insula and inferior frontal gyrus. The authors also found that greater education was associated with lower DSST activation - however this was not significant after adjusting for Abeta. DISCUSSION: Greater amyloid was associated with greater activation, which may represent compensatory activation. Greater education was associated with lower activation, which may represent more efficient activation (i.e., less activation for the same task). After adjusting for amyloid, education was not significantly associated with activation suggesting that during the preclinical stage amyloid is the primary determinant of activation. Further, activation was not associated with cognitive function. Compensatory activation in the preclinical stage may help maintain cognitive function.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide aggregation is considered as one of the key hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, Abeta peptide aggregation increases considerably in the presence of metal ions and triggers the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which ultimately leads to oxidative stress and neuronal damage. Based on the 'multitarget-directed ligands' (MTDLs) strategy, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated a novel series of triazole-based compounds for AD treatment via experimental and computational methods. Among the designed MTDLs [4(a-x)], the triazole derivative 4v exhibited the most potent inhibition of self-induced Abeta42 aggregation (78.02%) with an IC50 value of 4.578 +- 0.109 muM and also disassembled the preformed Abeta42 aggregates significantly. In addition, compound 4v showed excellent metal chelating ability and maintained copper in the redox-dormant state to prevent the generation of ROS in copper-ascorbate redox cycling. Further, 4v significantly inhibited Cu2+-induced Abeta42 aggregation and disassembled the Cu2+-induced Abeta42 protofibrils as compared to the reference compound clioquinol (CQ). Importantly, 4v did not show cytotoxicity and was able to inhibit the toxicity induced by Abeta42 aggregates in SH-SY5Y cells. Molecular docking results confirmed the strong binding of 4v with Abeta42 monomer and Abeta42 protofibril structure. The experimental and molecular docking results highlighted that 4v is a promising multifunctional lead compound for AD.",

    "abstract": "The strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the Apolipoprotein E type 4 allele (ApoE epsilon4). The interaction between sex and ApoE epsilon4 carrier status on AD risk remains an area of intense investigation. We hypothesized that sex modulates the relationship between ApoE epsilon4 carrier status and brain tau deposition (a quantitative endophenotype in AD) in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Preprocessed 18F-AV-1451 tau and 18F-AV-45 amyloid PET images, T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, demographic information, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) measurements from 108 MCI subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were included. After downloading pre-processed images from ADNI, an iterative reblurred Van Cittertiteration partial volume correction (PVC) method was applied to all PET images. MRIs were used for PET spatial normalization. Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined in standard space, and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) images relative to cerebellum were computed. ApoE epsilon4 by sex interaction analyses on 18F-AV-1451 and CSF tau (t-tau, p-tau) were assessed using generalized linear models. The association between 18F-AV-1451 SUVR and CSF tau (t-tau, p-tau) was assessed. Results: After applying PVC and controlling for age, education level and global cortical 18F-AV-45 SUVR, we found that the entorhinal cortex, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, posterior cingulate, and occipital ROIs exhibited a significant ApoE epsilon4 by sex interaction effect (false discovery rate P < 0.1) among MCI individuals. We also found a significant ApoE epsilon4 by sex interaction effect on CSF t-tau and p-tau. 18F-AV-1451 SUVR in the 5 ROIs with ApoE epsilon4 by sex interaction was significantly correlated with CSF p-tau and t-tau. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that women are more susceptible to ApoE epsilon4-associated accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles in MCI compared to males. Both CSF tau (p-tau, t-tau) and brain tau PET are robust quantitative biomarkers for studying ApoE epsilon4 by sex effects on brain tau deposition in MCI participants.",

Here, we investigated expressive changes of two main Abeta transport receptors low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP1) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in a novel AD mice (APP23) with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) model, moreover, examined a protective effect of a free radical scavenger edaravone (Eda). In contrast to wild type (WT) and APP23 mice, CCH strongly accelerated abnormal Abeta40 depositions and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) pathology, increased both LRP1 and RAGE expressions in brain parenchyma, while a decrease of LRP1 and an increase of RAGE were observed in vascular endothelial cells at age 12 months (M) of AD mice. Furthermore, CCH strongly increased expressions of two hypoxia-related proteins hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), two oxidative-related proteins 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and decreased both two vital nutrient transporter proteins major facilitator super family domain containing 2a (Mfsd2a) and glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) expressions. Such the above abnormal pathological changes were significantly ameliorated by edaravone treatment. The present study demonstrated that CCH strongly enhanced primary AD pathology causing double imbalances of Abeta efflux and influx transport related proteins in the cortical blood vessels in AD mice, and that such a neuropathologic abnormality was greatly ameliorated by Eda.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has unveiled specific alterations at different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiologic continuum constituting what has been established as \"AD signature\". To what extent MRI can detect amyloid-related cerebral changes from structural MRI in cognitively unimpaired individuals is still an area open for exploration. METHOD: Longitudinal 3D-T1 MRI scans were acquired from a subset of the ADNI cohort comprising 403 subjects: 79 controls (Ctrls), 50 preclinical AD (PreAD), and 274 MCI and dementia due to AD (MCI/AD). Amyloid CSF was used as gold-standard measure with established cutoffs (< 192 pg/mL) to establish diagnostic categories. Cognitively unimpaired individuals were defined as Ctrls if were amyloid negative and PreAD otherwise. The MCI/AD group was amyloid positive. Only subjects with the same diagnostic category at baseline and follow-up visits were considered for the study. Longitudinal morphometric analysis was performed using SPM12 to calculate Jacobian determinant maps. Statistical analysis was carried out on these Jacobian maps to identify structural changes that were significantly different between diagnostic categories. A machine learning classifier was applied on Jacobian determinant maps to predict the presence of abnormal amyloid levels in cognitively unimpaired individuals. The performance of this classifier was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and as a function of the follow-up time between MRI scans. We applied a cost function to assess the benefit of using this classifier in the triaging of individuals in a clinical trial-recruitment setting. RESULTS: The optimal follow-up time for classification of Ctrls vs PreAD was Deltat > 2.5 years, and hence, only subjects within this temporal span are used for evaluation (15 Ctrls, 10 PreAD). The longitudinal voxel-based classifier achieved an AUC = 0.87 (95%CI 0.72-0.97). The brain regions that showed the highest discriminative power to detect amyloid abnormalities were the medial, inferior, and lateral temporal lobes; precuneus; caudate heads; basal forebrain; and lateral ventricles. CONCLUSIONS: Our work supports that machine learning applied to longitudinal brain volumetric changes can be used to predict, with high precision, the presence of amyloid abnormalities in cognitively unimpaired subjects. Used as a triaging method to identify a fixed number of amyloid-positive individuals, this longitudinal voxel-wise classifier is expected to avoid 55% of unnecessary CSF and/or PET scans and reduce economic cost by 40%.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity (the co-occurrence of multiple chronic conditions) is increasingly common, especially among people with dementia. Few neuroimaging studies have explored amyloid biomarkers in people with multimorbidity. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to conduct the first study of the association between multimorbidity and cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta42 (CSF Abeta). METHOD: The European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia (EPAD) Longitudinal Cohort Study V500.0 dataset includes volunteers aged >=50 years from 12 sites. Participants undergo detailed phenotyping, including CSF measures and a self-reported medical history. Using logistic and linear regression analyses, we explored the association between multimorbidity and continuous chronic condition count with CSF Abeta positivity (Abeta42 <1000pg/ml) and continuous CSF Abeta concentration. All models were adjusted for age, sex, APOE status, education, and family history of dementia. RESULTS: Among 447 eligible participants without dementia, the mean (SD) age was 66.6 (6.6) years, 234 (52.3%) were women, and 157 (35.1%) were amyloid positive. With chronic conditions regarded as pseudo-continuous, each additional condition carried a decreased likelihood of amyloid positivity (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68-0.97; p = 0.026). With CSF Abeta as a continuous variable, each additional condition was associated with an increase of 54.2 pg/ml (95% CI: 9.9-98.5, p = 0.017). Having >=2 conditions was inversely associated with amyloid positivity (OR 0.59, 95% CI: 0.37-0.95, p = 0.030) compared to one or none. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the established association between multimorbidity and dementia may be due to a pathway other than amyloid. However, this cross-sectional study does not allow us to make causal inferences. Longitudinal work is required to confirm the inverse association found.",

    "title": "Ultrasensitive Detection of Plasma Amyloid-beta as a Biomarker for Cognitively Normal Elderly Individuals at Risk of Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aberrant amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in the brain occurs two decades prior to the manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical symptoms and therefore brain Abeta load measured using PET serves as a gold standard biomarker for the early diagnosis of AD. However, the uneconomical nature of PET makes blood markers, that reflect brain Abeta deposition, attractive candidates for investigation as surrogate markers. OBJECTIVE: Investigation of plasma Abeta as a surrogate marker for brain Abeta deposition in cognitively normal elderly individuals. METHODS: Plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 concentrations were measured using the ultrasensitive Single Molecule Array (Simoa) assay in 95 cognitively normal elderly individuals, who have all undergone PET to assess brain Abeta deposition. Based on the standard uptake value ratios (SUVR) obtained from PET imaging, using the tracer 18F-Florbetaben, plasma Abeta was compared between 32 participants assessed to have low brain Abeta load (Abeta-, SUVR <1.35) and 63 assessed to have high brain Abeta load (Abeta+, SUVR >=1.35). RESULTS: Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios were lower in the Abeta+ group compared to the Abeta-group. Plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels were not significantly different between Abeta-and Abeta+ groups, although a trend of higher plasma Abeta40 was observed in the Abeta+ group. Additionally, plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios along with the known AD risk factors, age and APOEe4 status, resulted in Abeta+ participants being distinguished from Abeta-participants based on an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve shown to be 78%. CONCLUSION: Plasma Abeta ratios in this study are a potential biomarker for brain Abeta deposition and therefore, for preclinical AD. However, this method to measure plasma Abeta needs further development to increase the accuracy of this promising AD blood biomarker.",

    "title": "Preparation and characterization of a highly soluble Abeta1-42 peptide variant.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disease marked by the accumulation and deposition of misfolded amyloid beta or Abeta (Abeta) peptide. Two species of Abeta peptides are found in amyloid plaques, Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42, with the latter being the more amyloidogenic of the two. Understanding how and why Abeta peptides misfold, oligomerize and form amyloid plaques requires a detailed understanding of their structure and dynamics. The poor solubility and strong aggregation tendencies of Abeta1-42 has made the isolation and characterization of its different structural isoforms (monomer, dimer, oligomer, amyloid) exceedingly difficult. Furthermore, while synthetic Abeta1-42 peptides (Abeta42syn) are readily available, the cost of isotopically labeled peptide is substantial, making their characterization by NMR spectroscopy cost prohibitive. Here we describe the design, cloning, high-level production, isotopic labeling and biophysical characterization of a modified (solubility-tagged) Abeta1-42 variant that exhibits excellent water solubility and shares similar aggregation properties as wildtype Abeta1-42. Specifically, we attached six lysines (6K) to the C-terminus of native Abeta1-42 to create a more soluble, monomeric form of Abeta1-42 called Abeta42C6K. A gene for the Abeta42C6K was designed, synthesized and cloned into Escherichia coli (E. coli) and the peptide was expressed at milligram levels. The Abeta42C6K peptide was characterized using circular dichroism (CD), NMR, electron microscopy and thioflavin T fluorescence. Its ability to form stable monomers, oligomers and fibrils under different conditions was assessed. Our results indicate that Abeta42C6K stays monomeric at high concentrations (unlike Abeta1-42) and can be induced to oligomerize and form fibrils like Abeta1-42. Our novel construct could be used to explore the structure and dynamics of Abeta1-42 as well as the interaction of ligands with Abeta1-42 via NMR.",

    "abstract": "Brain tissue of Alzheimer's disease patients invariably contains deposits of insoluble, fibrillar aggregates of peptide fragments of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), typically 40 or 42 residues in length and referred to as Abeta40 and Abeta42. However, it remains unclear whether these fibrils or oligomers constitute the toxic species. Depending on sample conditions, oligomers can form in a few seconds or less. These oligomers are invisible to solution NMR spectroscopy, but they can be rapidly (<1 s) resolubilized and converted to their NMR-visible monomeric constituents by raising the hydrostatic pressure to a few kbar. Hence, utilizing pressure-jump NMR, the oligomeric state can be studied at residue-specific resolution by monitoring its signals in the monomeric state. Oligomeric states of Abeta40 exhibit a high degree of order, reflected by slow longitudinal 15N relaxation (T1 > 5 s) for residues 18-21 and 31-34, whereas the N-terminal 10 residues relax much faster (T1 <= 1.5 s), indicative of extensive internal motions. Transverse relaxation rates rapidly increase to ca. 1000 s-1 after the oligomerization is initiated.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Flavonoids form a diverse class of naturally occurring polyphenols ascribed various biological activities, including inhibition of amyloid beta (Abeta) fibrillisation and neurotoxicity of relevance to Alzheimer's disease. Cannabis contains a unique subset of prenylated flavonoids, the cannflavins. While selected conventional flavonoids have demonstrated anti-amyloid and neuroprotective potential, any neuroprotective bioactivity of prenylated flavonoids has not been determined. We evaluated the in vitro neuroprotective and anti-aggregative properties of the novel geranylated cannabis-derived flavonoid, cannflavin A against Abeta1-42 and compared it to two similarly geranylated flavonoids, mimulone and diplacone, to compare the bioactive properties of these unique flavonoids more broadly. METHODS: Neuronal viability were assessed in PC12 cells biochemically using the MTT assay in the presence of each flavonoid (1-200 microM) for 48 h. Sub-toxic threshold test concentrations of each flavonoid were then applied to cells, alone or with concomitant incubation with the lipid peroxidant tert-butyl hyrdroperoxide (t-bhp) or amyloid beta (Abeta1-42; 0-2 microM). Fluorescent staining was used to indicate effects of Abeta1-42 on PC12 cellular morphology, while direct effects of each flavonoid on Abeta fibril formation and aggregation were assessed using the Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorometric kinetic assay and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to visualise fibril and aggregate morphology. RESULTS: Cannflavin A demonstrated intrinsic hormetic effects on cell viability, increasing viability by 40% from 1 to 10 microM but displaying neurotoxicity at higher (>10-100 microM) concentrations. Neither mimulone nor diplacone exhibited such a biphasic effect, instead showing only concentration-dependent neurotoxicity, with diplacone the more potent (from >1 microM). However at the lower concentrations (<10 microM), cannflavin A increased cell viability by up to 40%, while 10 microM cannflavin A inhibited the neurotoxicity elicited by Abeta1-42 (0-2 microM), reducing Abeta aggregate adherence to PC-12 cells and associated neurite loss. The neuroprotective effects of cannflavin A were associated with a direct inhibition of Abeta1-42 fibril and aggregate density, evidenced by attenuated ThT fluorescence kinetics and microscopic evidence of both altered and diminished density of Abeta aggregate and fibril morphology via electron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight a concentration-dependent hormetic and neuroprotective role of cannflavin A against Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity, associated with an inhibition of Abeta fibrillisation. The efficacy of the cannabis flavone may itself direct further lead development targeting neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. However, the geranylated flavonoids generally displayed a comparatively potent neurotoxicity not observed with many conventional flavonoids in vitro.",

Here we eliminate the toxicity of amyloid beta (Abeta) in a facile, high-throughput zebrafish (Danio rerio) model using casein coated-gold nanoparticles (betaCas AuNPs). betaCas AuNPs in systemic circulation translocate across the blood brain barrier of zebrafish larvae and sequester intracerebral Abeta42 and its elicited toxicity in a nonspecific, chaperone-like manner. This is evidenced by behavioral pathology, reactive oxygen species and neuronal dysfunction biomarkers assays, complemented by brain histology and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy. We further demonstrate the capacity of betaCas AuNPs in recovering the mobility and cognitive function of adult zebrafish exposed to Abeta. This potent, safe-to-use, and easy-to-apply nanomedicine may find broad use for eradicating toxic amyloid proteins implicated in a range of human diseases.",

While ATXN1 is associated with increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, CAG repeat number in AD patients is not changed. Here, we investigated the consequences of ataxin-1 loss of function and discovered that knockout of Atxn1 reduced CIC-ETV4/5-mediated inhibition of Bace1 transcription, leading to increased BACE1 levels and enhanced amyloidogenic cleavage of APP, selectively in AD-vulnerable brain regions. Elevated BACE1 expression exacerbated Abeta deposition and gliosis in AD mouse models and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and olfactory axonal targeting. In SCA1 mice, polyglutamine-expanded mutant ataxin-1 led to the increase of BACE1 post-transcriptionally, both in cerebrum and cerebellum, and caused axonal-targeting deficit and neurodegeneration in the hippocampal CA2 region. These findings suggest that loss of ataxin-1 elevates BACE1 expression and Abeta pathology, rendering it a potential contributor to AD risk and pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the extraction fraction of volatile oil from Acorus gramineus has significant effects on anti-dementia and improving the learning and memory of animals. To date, limited studies have determined whether volatile oil from A. gramineus has the protective effect on neuronal damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of volatile oil from A. gramineus on Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice, by means of behavior test, immunohistochemistry and western blot methods. In this study, mice were injected with Abeta1-42 in the bilateral hippocampus to establish the AD model. On the seventh day after modeling, the mice with cognitive dysfunction were selected by the novel object recognition task. Subsequently, the volatile oil treatment groups underwent intragastric administration for per 10 g body weight 2.5 or 5 muL volatile oil from A. gramineus for 3 weeks. The control group and the AD group were given the same amount of saline. Our results showed that after treatment of volatile oil from A. gramineus, the number of Doublecortin and Nestin positive cells increased significantly, suggesting that the volatile oil from A. gramineus may induce the regeneration of hippocampal neurons in mice, and promote the growth of hippocampal neurons by upregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, tyrosine protein kinase B, and neurotrophin-3 expression. These results might provide more experimental evidences for underlying mechanism about the neuroprotective effects of volatile oil from A. gramineus against AD relevant symptoms.

    "abstract": "Exercise is a non-pharmacological strategy that may help to protect against cognitive decline and reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. However, the optimal exercise modes for cognitive benefits are controversial. Mitochondrial function has been related to both exercise and cognition. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of two exercise modes on cognitive function and mitochondrial dynamics in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The results showed that 12-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) could improve exploratory behavior, spatial learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Both HIIT and MICT interventions significantly alleviated the hippocampal beta-Amyloid (Abeta) burden and mitochondrial fragmentation and improved mitochondrial morphology in hippocampus. Furthermore, both HIIT and MICT interventions down-regulated dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and fission 1 (FIS1), whereas mitofusin 1 (MFN1), mitofusin 2 (MFN2) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) were up-regulated. Hippocampal levels of total reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were decreased, whereas activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were elevated by HIIT and MICT. The study suggests that both HIIT and MICT alleviate cognitive decline and down-regulat Abeta level in the hippocampus in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, which may be mediated by improvements in mitochondrial morphology and dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is accompanied by the dysfunction of intracellular protein homeostasis systems, in particular the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta), which is involved in the processes of neurodegeneration in AD, is a substrate of this system, however its effect on UPS activity is still poorly explored. Here we found that Abeta peptides inhibited the proteolytic activity of the antiapoptotic Arg/N-end rule pathway that is a part of UPS. We identified arginyltransferase Ate1 as a specific component of the Arg/N-end rule pathway targeted by Abetas. Abeta bearing the familial English H6R mutation, known to cause early-onset AD, had an even greater inhibitory effect on protein degradation through the Arg/N-end rule pathway than intact Abeta. This effect was associated with a significant decrease in Ate1-1 and Ate1-3 catalytic activity. We also found that the loss of Ate1 in neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells eliminated the apoptosis-inducing effects of Abeta peptides. Together, our results show that the apoptotic effect of Abeta peptides is linked to their impairment of Ate1 catalytic activity leading to suppression of the Arg/N-end rule pathway proteolytic activity and ultimately cell death.",

    "abstract": "The neuropathologic basis of in vivo cortical atrophy in clinical dementia syndromes remains poorly understood. This includes primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a language-based dementia syndrome characterized by asymmetric cortical atrophy. The neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid-ss plaques (APs) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can cause PPA, but a quantitative investigation of the relationships between NFTs, APs and in vivo cortical atrophy in PPA-AD is lacking. The present study measured cortical atrophy from corresponding bilateral regions in five PPA-AD participants with in vivo magnetic resonance imaging scans 7-30 months before death and acquired stereologic estimates of NFTs and dense-core APs visualized with the Thioflavin-S stain. Linear mixed models accounting for repeated measures and stratified by hemisphere and region (language vs. non-language) were used to determine the relationships between cortical atrophy and AD neuropathology and their regional selectivity. Consistent with the aphasic profile of PPA, left language regions displayed more cortical atrophy (P = 0.01) and NFT densities (P = 0.02) compared to right language homologues. Left language regions also showed more cortical atrophy (P < 0.01) and NFT densities (P = 0.02) than left non-language regions. A subset of data was analyzed to determine the predilection of AD neuropathology for neocortical regions compared to entorhinal cortex in the left hemisphere, which showed that the three most atrophied language regions had greater NFT (P = 0.04) and AP densities (P < 0.01) than the entorhinal cortex. These results provide quantitative evidence that NFT accumulation in PPA selectively targets the language network and may not follow the Braak staging of neurofibrillary degeneration characteristic of amnestic AD. Only NFT densities, not AP densities, were positively associated with cortical atrophy within left language regions (P < 0.01) and right language homologues (P < 0.01). Given previous findings from amnestic AD, the current study of PPA-AD provides converging evidence that NFTs are the principal determinants of atrophy and clinical phenotypes associated with AD.",

AD pathology is initiated by cerebral aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the form of amyloid plaques; however, the mechanism how Abeta peptide aggregates participate in the disease progression and neurodegeneration is still under debate. Human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y is a convenient cellular model, which is widely used in biochemical and toxicological studies of neurodegenerative diseases. This model can be further improved by differentiation of the cells toward more neuron-like culture using different protocols. In the current study, dbcAMP, retinoic acid with TPA, or BDNF were used for differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells, and the resulting cultures were tested for the toxicity toward the Abeta42 peptide. The toxicity of Abeta42 peptide depended on the type of differentiated cells: RA and TPA- differentiated cells were most resistant, whereas dbcAMP and RA/BDNF- differentiated cells were more sensitive to Abeta toxicity as compared with non-differentiated cells. The differentiated cultures provide more appropriate cellular models of human origin that can be used for studies of the mechanism of Abeta pathogenesis and for a screening of compounds antagonistic to the toxicity of Abeta peptides.",

The recognition of familial patterns of dementia has led to the discovery of genetic factors that have a role in the pathogenesis of dementia, including the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and a large and still-growing number of genetic variants1,2. Beyond genetic architecture, several modifiable risk factors have been implicated in the development of dementia3. Prevention trials of measures to halt or delay cognitive decline are increasingly recruiting older individuals who are genetically predisposed to dementia. However, it remains unclear whether targeted health and lifestyle interventions can attenuate or even offset increased genetic risk. Here, we leverage long-term data on both genetic and modifiable risk factors from 6,352 individuals aged 55 years and older in the population-based Rotterdam Study. In this study, we demonstrate that, in individuals at low and intermediate genetic risk, favorable modifiable-risk profiles are related to a lower risk of dementia compared to unfavorable profiles. In contrast, these protective associations were not found in those at high genetic risk.",

    "abstract": "The self-assembly of amyloid peptides (Abeta), in particular Abeta1-42, into oligomers and fibrils is one of the main pathological events related to Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of carbon monoxide-releasing molecules (CORMs) to protect neurons and astrocytes from Abeta1-42 toxicity. In fact, CORMs are able to carry and release controlled levels of CO and are known to exert a wide range of anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities at physiologically relevant concentrations. In order to investigate the direct effects of CORMs on Abeta1-42, we studied the reactivity of CORM-2 and CORM-3 with Abeta1-42 in vitro and the potential inhibition of its aggregation by mass spectrometry (MS), as well as fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopies. The application of an electrospray ionization-MS (ESI-MS) method allowed the detection of stable Abeta1-42/CORMs adducts, involving the addition of the Ru(CO)2 portion of CORMs at histidine residues on the Abeta1-42 skeleton. Moreover, CORMs showed anti-aggregating properties through formation of stable adducts with Abeta1-42 as demonstrated by a thioflavin T fluorescence assay and MS analysis. As further proof, comparison of the CD spectra of Abeta1-42 recorded in the absence and in the presence of CORM-3 at a 1:1 molar ratio showed the ability of CORM-3 to stabilize the peptide in its soluble, unordered conformation, thereby preventing its misfolding and aggregation. This multi-methodological investigation revealed novel interactions between Abeta1-42 and CORMs, contributing new insights into the proposed neuroprotective mechanisms mediated by CORMs and disclosing a new strategy to divert amyloid aggregation and toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly, characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Synaptic plasticity impairment is one of the early pathological events in AD. Transgenic APP/PS1 mice that overproduce Abeta are one of the most extensively used AD animal models. Many studies have investigated the roles of NTF-related p-Tau, non-amyloidogenic ADAM10, amyloidogenic BACE1, Abeta proteolytic NEP and IDE in certain ages of APP/PS1 mice as well as dendritic spine-related Rictor and Profilin-1 in normal mice, but there are few studies exploring the age-related changes of these molecules in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, current studies regarding when memory impairment occurs in these mice are controversial. Thus, we examined the changes of these molecules in APP/PS1 and control mice using Western blot in mice 2-month-old (2 m) to 10 m of age and behavior changes using the Morris water maze from 4 m to 8 m. The results showed that in APP/PS1 mice, significant changes of hippocampal p-Tau, Abeta, ADAM10, BACE1 and Rictor occurred at 6 m, NEP at 8 m, and IDE and Profilin-1 at 10 m. In control mice, changes of p-Tau, ADAM10, and BACE1 occurred at 8 m and NEP at 10 m, while IDE, Rictor and Profilin-1 remained unchanged. Importantly, the Morris water maze test revealed that spatial memory impairment was detected at 8 m but not 4 or 6 m. The above findings clearly evidence that neurochemical changes overtly precede cognitive dysfunctions in this AD model and provide novel knowledge for a better understanding of the molecular events driving AD.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque deposits and inflammatory immune activation are thought to alter various aspects of tissue microstructure, such as extracellular free water, fractional anisotropy and diffusivity, as well as the density and geometric arrangement of axonal processes. Quantifying these microstructural changes in Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative dementias could serve to monitor or predict disease course. In the present study we used high-field diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to investigate the effects of Abeta and inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL6), alone or in combination, on in vivo tissue microstructure in the TgCRND8 mouse model of Alzheimer's-type Abeta deposition. TgCRND8 and non-transgenic (nTg) mice expressing brain-targeted IL6 or enhanced glial fibrillary protein (EGFP controls) were scanned at 8 months of age using a 2-shell, 54-gradient direction dMRI sequence at 11.1 T. Images were processed using the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model or the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) model. DTI and NODDI processing in TgCRND8 mice revealed a microstructure pattern in white matter (WM) and hippocampus consistent with radial and longitudinal diffusivity deficits along with an increase in density and geometric complexity of axonal and dendritic processes. This included reduced FA, mean, axial and radial diffusivity, and increased orientation dispersion (ODI) and intracellular volume fraction (ICVF) measured in WM and hippocampus. IL6 produced a 'protective-like' effect on WM FA in TgCRND8 mice, observed as an increased FA that counteracted a reduction in FA observed with endogenous Abeta production and accumulation. In addition, we found that ICVF and ODI had an inverse relationship with the functional connectome clustering coefficient. The relationship between NODDI and graph theory metrics suggests that currently unknown microstructure alterations in WM and hippocampus are associated with diminished functional network organization in the brain.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Large variability among Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases might impact genetic discoveries and complicate dissection of underlying biological pathways. METHODS: Genome Research at Fundacio ACE (GR@ACE) is a genome-wide study of dementia and its clinical endophenotypes, defined based on AD's clinical certainty and vascular burden. We assessed the impact of known AD loci across endophenotypes to generate loci categories. We incorporated gene coexpression data and conducted pathway analysis per category. Finally, to evaluate the effect of heterogeneity in genetic studies, GR@ACE series were meta-analyzed with additional genome-wide association study data sets. RESULTS: We classified known AD loci into three categories, which might reflect the disease clinical heterogeneity. Vascular processes were only detected as a causal mechanism in probable AD. The meta-analysis strategy revealed the ANKRD31-rs4704171 and NDUFAF6-rs10098778 and confirmed SCIMP-rs7225151 and CD33-rs3865444. DISCUSSION: The regulation of vasculature is a prominent causal component of probable AD. GR@ACE meta-analysis revealed novel AD genetic signals, strongly driven by the presence of clinical heterogeneity in the AD series.",

    "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS) is characterized by cognitive deficits throughout the life span and with the development of aging-dependent Alzheimer's type neuropathology, which is related to the triplication of the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) gene. A dysfunctional endosomal system in neurons is an early characteristic of DS and APP metabolites accumulate in endosomes in DS neurons. We have previously shown enhanced release of exosomes in the brain of DS patients and the mouse model of DS Ts[Rb(12.1716)]2Cje (Ts2), and by DS fibroblasts, as compared with diploid controls. Here, we demonstrate that exosome-enriched extracellular vesicles (hereafter called EVs) isolated from DS and Ts2 brains, and from the culture media of human DS fibroblasts are enriched in APP carboxyl-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) as compared with diploid controls. Moreover, APP-CTFs levels increase in an age-dependent manner in EVs isolated from the brain of Ts2 mice. The release of APP-CTFs-enriched exosomes may have a pathogenic role by transporting APP-CTFs into naive neurons and propagating these neurotoxic metabolites, which are also a source of amyloid beta, throughout the brain, but also provides a benefit to DS neurons by shedding APP-CTFs accumulated intracellularly.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by cognitive alterations, cerebral atrophy and neuropathological lesions including neuronal loss, accumulation of misfolded and aggregated beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) and tau proteins. Iatrogenic induction of Abeta is suspected in patients exposed to pituitary-derived hormones, dural grafts, or surgical instruments, presumably contaminated with Abeta. Induction of Abeta and tau lesions has been demonstrated in transgenic mice after contamination with Alzheimer's disease brain homogenates, with very limited functional consequences. Unlike rodents, primates naturally express Abeta or tau under normal conditions and attempts to transmit Alzheimer pathology to primates have been made for decades. However, none of earlier studies performed any detailed functional assessments. For the first time we demonstrate long term memory and learning impairments in a non-human primate (Microcebus murinus) following intracerebral injections with Alzheimer human brain extracts. Animals inoculated with Alzheimer brain homogenates displayed progressive cognitive impairments (clinical tests assessing cognitive and motor functions), modifications of neuronal activity (detected by electroencephalography), widespread and progressive cerebral atrophy (in vivo MRI assessing cerebral volume loss using automated voxel-based analysis), neuronal loss in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (post mortem stereology). They displayed parenchymal and vascular Abeta depositions and tau lesions for some of them, in regions close to the inoculation sites. Although these lesions were sparse, they were never detected in control animals. Tau-positive animals had the lowest performances in a memory task and displayed the greatest neuronal loss. Our study is timely and important as it is the first one to highlight neuronal and clinical dysfunction following inoculation of Alzheimer's disease brain homogenates in a primate. Clinical signs in a chronic disease such as Alzheimer take a long time to be detectable. Documentation of clinical deterioration and/or dysfunction following intracerebral inoculations with Alzheimer human brain extracts could lead to important new insights about Alzheimer initiation processes.",

    "title": "Spontaneous Isomerization of Long-Lived Proteins Provides a Molecular Mechanism for the Lysosomal Failure Observed in Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "Proteinaceous aggregation is a well-known observable in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but failure and storage of lysosomal bodies within neurons is equally ubiquitous and actually precedes bulk accumulation of extracellular amyloid plaque. In fact, AD shares many similarities with certain lysosomal storage disorders though establishing a biochemical connection has proven difficult. Herein, we demonstrate that isomerization and epimerization, which are spontaneous chemical modifications that occur in long-lived proteins, prevent digestion by the proteases in the lysosome (namely, the cathepsins). For example, isomerization of aspartic acid into l-isoAsp prevents digestion of the N-terminal portion of Abeta by cathepsin L, one of the most aggressive lysosomal proteases. Similar results were obtained after examination of various target peptides with a full series of cathepsins, including endo-, amino-, and carboxy-peptidases. In all cases peptide fragments too long for transporter recognition or release from the lysosome persisted after treatment, providing a mechanism for eventual lysosomal storage and bridging the gap between AD and lysosomal storage disorders. Additional experiments with microglial cells confirmed that isomerization disrupts proteolysis in active lysosomes. These results are easily rationalized in terms of protease active sites, which are engineered to precisely orient the peptide backbone and cannot accommodate the backbone shift caused by isoaspartic acid or side chain dislocation resulting from epimerization. Although Abeta is known to be isomerized and epimerized in plaques present in AD brains, we further establish that the rates of modification for aspartic acid in positions 1 and 7 are fast and could accrue prior to plaque formation. Spontaneous chemistry can therefore provide modified substrates capable of inducing gradual lysosomal failure, which may play an important role in the cascade of events leading to the disrupted proteostasis, amyloid formation, and tauopathies associated with AD.",

    "abstract": "Recent imaging studies of amyloid and tau in cognitively normal elderly subjects imply that Alzheimer's pathology can be tolerated by the brain to some extent due to compensatory mechanisms operating at the cellular and synaptic levels. The present study investigated the effects of an allosteric inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-4D (PDE4D), known as BPN14770 (2-(4-((2-(3-Chlorophenyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-yl)methyl)phenyl)acetic Acid), on impairment of memory, dendritic structure, and synaptic proteins induced by bilateral microinjection of oligomeric amyloid beta (Abeta 1-42 into the hippocampus of humanized PDE4D (hPDE4D) mice. The hPDE4D mice provide a unique and powerful genetic tool for assessing PDE4D target engagement. Behavioral studies showed that treatment with BPN14770 significantly improved memory acquisition and retrieval in the Morris water maze test and the percentage of alternations in the Y-maze test in the model of Abeta impairment. Microinjection of oligomeric Abeta 1-42 caused decreases in the number of dendrites, dendritic length, and spine density of pyramid neurons in the hippocampus. These changes were prevented by BPN14770 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, molecular studies showed that BPN14770 prevented Abeta-induced decreases in synaptophysin, postsynaptic density protein 95, phosphorylated cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)/CREB, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and nerve growth factor inducible protein levels in the hippocampus. The protective effects of BPN14770 against Abeta-induced memory deficits, synaptic damage, and the alteration in the cAMP-meditated cell signaling cascade were blocked by H-89 (N-[2-(p-Bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide dihydrochloride), an inhibitor of protein kinase A. These results suggest that BPN14770 may activate compensatory mechanisms that support synaptic health even with the onset of amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study demonstrates that a phosphodiesterase-4D allosteric inhibitor, BPN14770, protects against memory loss and neuronal atrophy induced by oligomeric Abeta 1-42. The study provides useful insight into the potential role of compensatory mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease in a model of oligomeric Abeta 1-42 neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Recently, increasing evidence has suggested the association between gut dysbiosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, yet the role of gut microbiota in AD pathogenesis remains obscure. Herein, we provide a potential mechanistic link between gut microbiota dysbiosis and neuroinflammation in AD progression. Using AD mouse models, we discovered that, during AD progression, the alteration of gut microbiota composition leads to the peripheral accumulation of phenylalanine and isoleucine, which stimulates the differentiation and proliferation of pro-inflammatory T helper 1 (Th1) cells. The brain-infiltrated peripheral Th1 immune cells are associated with the M1 microglia activation, contributing to AD-associated neuroinflammation. Importantly, the elevation of phenylalanine and isoleucine concentrations and the increase of Th1 cell frequency in the blood were also observed in two small independent cohorts of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD. Furthermore, GV-971, a sodium oligomannate that has demonstrated solid and consistent cognition improvement in a phase 3 clinical trial in China, suppresses gut dysbiosis and the associated phenylalanine/isoleucine accumulation, harnesses neuroinflammation and reverses the cognition impairment. Together, our findings highlight the role of gut dysbiosis-promoted neuroinflammation in AD progression and suggest a novel strategy for AD therapy by remodelling the gut microbiota.",

WMHs are also frequently observed in patients with familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease, often with a particular posterior predominance. Whether amyloid and tau pathologies are linked to WMH occurrence is still debated. We examined whether cerebral amyloid and tau burden, reflected in cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta-42) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau), are related to WMH location in a cohort of 517 memory clinic patients. Two lesion mapping techniques were performed: voxel-based analyses and region of interest-based linear regression. Voxelwise associations were found between lower Abeta-42 and parieto-occipital periventricular WMHs. Regression analyses demonstrated that lower Abeta-42 correlated with larger WMH volumes in the splenium of the corpus callosum and posterior thalamic radiation, also after controlling for markers of vascular disease. P-tau was not consistently related to WMH occurrence. Our findings indicate that cerebral amyloid burden is associated with WMHs located in specific posterior white matter regions, possibly reflecting region-specific effects of amyloid pathology on the white matter.",

Recent genome-wide association studies have highlighted multiple immune-related genes in association with Alzheimer's disease, and experimental data have demonstrated microglial proliferation as a significant component of the neuropathology. In this study, we tested the efficacy of the selective CSF1R inhibitor JNJ-40346527 (JNJ-527) in the P301S mouse tauopathy model. We first demonstrated the anti-proliferative effects of JNJ-527 on microglia in the ME7 prion model, and its impact on the inflammatory profile, and provided potential CNS biomarkers for clinical investigation with the compound, including pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics and efficacy assessment by TSPO autoradiography and CSF proteomics. Then, we showed for the first time that blockade of microglial proliferation and modification of microglial phenotype leads to an attenuation of tau-induced neurodegeneration and results in functional improvement in P301S mice. Overall, this work strongly supports the potential for inhibition of CSF1R as a target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other tau-mediated neurodegenerative diseases.",

Statistical power was estimated. RESULTS: The harmonized database included 7779 participants with clinical/cognitive data: 3542 were 18~65 years at the baseline, 5865 had longitudinal cognitive data for a median of 4.7 years, 2473 participated in the cerebrospinal fluid studies (906 had longitudinal data), 2496 participated in the magnetic resonance imaging studies (1283 had longitudinal data), and 1498 participated in the positron emission tomography amyloid studies (849 had longitudinal data). The database provides adequate power for detecting early biomarker changes, and demonstrates the feasibility of AD prevention trials on middle-aged individuals.

    "title": "Fibrillar and Nonfibrillar Amyloid Beta Structures Drive Two Modes of Membrane-Mediated Toxicity.",
    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease, the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is implicated in neuronal toxicity via interactions with the cell membrane. Monomeric Abeta (Abetam) is intrinsically disordered, but it can adopt a range of aggregated conformations with varying toxicities from short fibrillar oligomers (FO), to globular nonfibrillar oligomers (NFO), and full-length amyloid fibrils. NFO is considered to be the most toxic, followed by fibrils, and finally Abetam. To elucidate molecular-level membrane interactions that contribute to their different toxicities, we used liquid surface X-ray scattering and Langmuir trough insertion assays to compare Abetam, FO, and NFO surface activities and interactions with anionic DMPG lipid monolayers at the air/water interface. All Abeta species were highly surface active and rapidly adopted beta-sheet rich structures upon adsorption to the air/water interface. Likewise, all Abeta species had affinity for the anionic membrane. Abetam rapidly converted to beta-sheet rich assemblies upon binding the membrane, and these aggregated structures of Abetam and FO disrupted hexagonally packed lipid domains and resulted in membrane thinning and instability. In contrast, NFO perturbed membrane structure by extracting lipids from the air/water interface and causing macroscale membrane deformations. Altogether, our results support two models for membrane-mediated Abeta toxicity: fibril-induced reorganization of lipid packing and NFO-induced membrane destabilization and lipid extraction. This work provides a structural understanding of Abeta neurotoxicity via membrane interactions and aids the effort in understanding early events in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

Although these two amyloid-beta biomarkers generally show good correspondence, ~ 10-20% of cases have discordant results. To assess the consequences of having discordant amyloid-beta PET and CSF biomarkers on clinical features, biomarkers, and longitudinal cognitive trajectories. METHODS: We included 768 patients (194 with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), 127 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 309 Alzheimer's dementia (AD), and 138 non-AD) who were categorized as concordant-negative (n = 315, 41%), discordant (n = 97, 13%), or concordant-positive (n = 356, 46%) based on CSF and PET results. We compared discordant with both concordant-negative and concordant-positive groups on demographics, clinical syndrome, apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 status, CSF tau, and clinical and neuropsychological progression. RESULTS: We found an increase from concordant-negative to discordant to concordant-positive in rates of APOE epsilon4 (28%, 55%, 70%, Z = - 10.6, P < 0.001), CSF total tau (25%, 45%, 78%, Z = - 13.7, P < 0.001), and phosphorylated tau (28%, 43%, 80%, Z = - 13.7, P < 0.001) positivity. In patients without dementia, linear mixed models showed that Mini-Mental State Examination and memory composite scores did not differ between concordant-negative (beta [SE] - 0.13[0.08], P = 0.09) and discordant (beta 0.08[0.15], P = 0.15) patients (Pinteraction = 0.19), while these scores declined in concordant-positive (beta - 0.75[0.08] patients (Pinteraction < 0.001). In patients with dementia, longitudinal cognitive scores were not affected by amyloid-beta biomarker concordance or discordance. Clinical progression rates from SCD to MCI or dementia (P = 0.01) and from MCI to dementia (P = 0.003) increased from concordant-negative to discordant to concordant-positive. CONCLUSIONS: Discordant cases were intermediate to concordant-negative and concordant-positive patients in terms of genetic (APOE epsilon4) and CSF (tau) markers of AD. While biomarker agreement did not impact cognition in patients with dementia, discordant biomarkers are not benign in patients without dementia given their higher risk of clinical progression.",

    "abstract": "Senescent cells accumulate in various peripheral tissues during aging and have been shown to exacerbate age-related inflammatory responses. We recently showed that exposure to neurotoxic amyloid beta (Abeta1-42) oligomers can readily induce a senescence phenotype in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). In the present work, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to further characterize the morphological properties such as cell membrane roughness and cell height and nanomechanical properties such as Young's modulus of the membrane (membrane stiffness) and adhesion resulting from the interaction between AFM tip and cell membrane in Abeta1-42 oligomer-induced senescent human brain microvascular endothelial cells. Morphological imaging studies showed a flatter and spread-out nucleus in the senescent HBMECs, both characteristic features of a senescent phenotype. Furthermore, the mean cell body roughness and mean cell height were lower in senescent HBMECs compared to untreated normal HBMECs. We also observed increased stiffness and alterations in the adhesion properties in Abeta1-42 oligomer-induced senescent endothelial cells compared to the untreated normal HBMECs suggesting dynamic reorganization of cell membrane. We then show that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR-1) knockdown or overexpression of Rho GTPase Rac 1 in the endothelial cells inhibited senescence and reversed these nanomechanical alterations, confirming a direct role of these pathways in the senescent brain endothelial cells. These results illustrate that nanoindentation and topographic analysis of live senescent brain endothelial cells can provide insights into cerebrovascular dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "A dual-wavelength ratiometric electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ECL-RET) aptasensor based on the carbon nitride nanosheet (g-C3N4 NS) and metal-organic frameworks (Ru@MOFs) as energy donor-receptor pairs is first designed for the detection of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein. The cathode ECL of g-C3N4 NS gradually decreased, whereas the anode ECL from Ru@MOF pyramidally enhanced along with the increasing concentration of Abeta in a 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 0.1 M S2O82-. Additionally, it is worth noting that 2-amino terephthalic acid from MOF not only can load abundant amounts of luminophor Ru(bpy)32+ but also promote the conversion of more amounts of S2O82- that served as a coreactant accelerator into SO4 -, further enhancing the ECL signal of Ru@MOF. Besides, the ECL intensity from the g-C3N4 NS had a tremendous spectrum overlap with the UV-vis spectrum of Ru@MOF, demonstrating the high-efficiency ECL-RET from g-C3N4 NS to Ru@MOF. According to the ratio of ECL460nm/ECL620nm, the constructed aptasensor for the detection of Abeta showed a wide linear range from 10-5 to 500 ng/mL and a low detection limit of 3.9 fg/mL (S/N = 3) with a correction coefficient of 0.9965. The obtained results certified that the dual-wavelength ratiometric ECL sensor could provide a reliable direction and have the potential for application in biosensing and clinical diagnosis fields.",

    "abstract": "The use of fixed fibroblasts from familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease patients has previously indicated an upregulation of mitochondria-ER contacts (MERCs) as a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Despite its potential significance, the relevance of these results is limited because they were not extended to live neurons. Here we performed a dynamic in vivo analysis of MERCs in hippocampal neurons from McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rats, a model of Alzheimer's disease-like amyloid pathology. Live FRET imaging of neurons from transgenic rats revealed perturbed 'lipid-MERCs' (gap width <10 nm), while 'Ca2+-MERCs' (10-20 nm gap width) were unchanged. In situ TEM showed no significant differences in the lipid-MERCs:total MERCs or lipid-MERCs:mitochondria ratios; however, the average length of lipid-MERCs was significantly decreased in neurons from transgenic rats as compared to controls. In accordance with FRET results, untargeted lipidomics showed significant decreases in levels of 12 lipids and bioenergetic analysis revealed respiratory dysfunction of mitochondria from transgenic rats. Thus, our results reveal changes in MERC structures coupled with impaired mitochondrial functions in Alzheimer's disease-related neurons.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",

This study assessed cross-sectional relationships between cortisol and neuroimaging biomarkers of brain structure and glucose metabolism across the AD spectrum. Participants with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and AD were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative databank, based on baseline measures of plasma cortisol, gray matter volume (n = 556), and cerebral glucose metabolism (n = 288). Relationships between plasma cortisol and the neuroimaging biomarkers were assessed. Across the entire cohort, higher plasma cortisol levels were associated with lower glucose metabolism in lateral and medial parietal regions. Higher plasma cortisol was also related to lower gray matter volume in temporal-parietal-occipital regions and in the hippocampus. There were no significant group differences in these relationships with adjustment for covariates. Our results demonstrate that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation is related to glucose hypometabolism within posterior cortical regions vulnerable to AD pathology. This regional pattern appears to be distinct from cortisol-related associations with brain structure. Future studies should delineate pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these effects.",

    "abstract": "The APOEe4 gene variant is the strongest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas APOEe3 conventionally is considered as 'risk neutral' although APOEe3-carriers also develop AD. Previous studies have shown that the apolipoprotein E3 (apoE3) isoform occurs as monomers, homodimers and heterodimers with apolipoprotein A-II in human body fluids and brain tissue, but the relevance of a plasma apoE3 monomer/dimer profile to AD is unknown. Here we assessed the distribution of monomers, homodimers and heterodimers in plasma from control subjects and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD with either a homozygous APOEe3 (n = 31 control subjects, and n = 14 MCI versus n = 5 AD patients) or APOEe4 genotype (n = 1 control subject, n = 21 MCI and n = 7 AD patients). Total plasma apoE levels were lower in APOEe4-carriers and overall correlated significantly to CSF Abeta42, p(Thr181)-tau and t-tau levels. Apolipoprotein E dimers were only observed in the APOEe3-carriers and associated with total plasma apoE levels, negatively correlated to apoE monomers, but were unrelated to plasma homocysteine levels. Importantly, the APOEe3-carrying AD patients versus controls exhibited a significant decrease in apoE homodimers (17.8+-9.6% versus 26.7+-6.3%, p = 0.025) paralleled by an increase in apoE monomers (67.8+-18.3% versus 48.5+-11.2%, p = 0.008). In the controls, apoE monomers and heterodimers were significantly associated with plasma triglycerides; the apoE heterodimers were also associated with levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The physiological relevance of apoE dimer formation needs to be further investigated, though the distribution of apoE in monomers and dimers appears to be of relevance to AD in APOEe3 subjects.",

    "title": "Conformational Dynamics of Transmembrane Domain 3 of Presenilin 1 Is Associated with the Trimming Activity of gamma-Secretase.",
    "abstract": "gamma-Secretase is an intramembrane-cleaving protease that generates the toxic species of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) that is responsible for the pathology of Alzheimer disease. The catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase is presenilin 1 (PS1), which is a polytopic membrane protein with a hydrophilic catalytic pore. The length of the C terminus of Abeta is proteolytically determined by its processive trimming by gamma-secretase, although the precise mechanism still remains largely unknown. Here, we identified that transmembrane domain (TMD) 3 of human PS1 is involved in the formation of the intramembranous hydrophilic pore. Notably, the water accessibility of TMD3 was greatly altered by point mutations and compounds, which modify gamma-secretase activity. The changes in the water accessibility of TMD3 was also correlated with Abeta42 production. Moreover, crosslinking between TMD3 and TMD7 resulted in a loss of sensitivity to a gamma-secretase modulator that reduces Abeta42 production. Therefore, our findings indicate that the conformational dynamics of TMD3 is a prerequisite for regulation of the Abeta trimming activity of gamma-secretase.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Modulation of gamma-secretase activity to reduce the level of toxic amyloid-beta species is thought to be a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer disease. However, the detailed mechanism of the regulation of amyloid-beta production, as well as the structure-and-activity relationship of gamma-secretase remains unclear. Here we identified that the water accessibility around transmembrane domain 3 in presenilin 1 was increased along with a reduction in toxic amyloid-beta production. Our findings demonstrate how the structure of presenilin 1 dynamically changes during amyloid-beta production, and provides insights toward the development of treatments against Alzheimer disease.",

As Abeta has a wavelength-dependent effect on light scatter, we investigate the potential for in vivo retinal hyperspectral imaging to serve as a biomarker of brain Abeta. Significant differences in the retinal reflectance spectra are found between individuals with high Abeta burden on brain PET imaging and mild cognitive impairment (n = 15), and age-matched PET-negative controls (n = 20). Retinal imaging scores are correlated with brain Abeta loads. The findings are validated in an independent cohort, using a second hyperspectral camera. A similar spectral difference is found between control and 5xFAD transgenic mice that accumulate Abeta in the brain and retina.

The formation of amyloid plaques by aggregated amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides is a primary event in AD pathology. Understanding the metabolomic features and related pathways is critical for studying plaque-related pathological events (e.g., cell death and neuron dysfunction). Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), due to its high sensitivity and ability to obtain the spatial distribution of metabolites, has been applied to AD studies. However, limited studies of metabolites in amyloid plaques have been performed due to the drawbacks of the commonly used techniques such as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MSI. In the current study, we obtained high spatial resolution (~17 mum) MS images of the AD mouse brain using the Single-probe, a microscale sampling and ionization device, coupled to a mass spectrometer under ambient conditions. The adjacent slices were used to obtain fluorescence microscopy images to locate amyloid plaques. The MS image and the fluorescence microscopy image were fused to spatially correlate histological protein hallmarks with metabolomic features. The fused images produced significantly improved spatial resolution (~5 mum), allowing for the determination of fine structures in MS images and metabolomic biomarkers representing amyloid plaques.",

    "abstract": "The formation of oligomeric soluble aggregates is related to the toxicity of amyloid peptides and proteins. In this manuscript, we report the use of a ruthenium polypyridyl complex ([Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]2+) to track the formation of amyloid oligomers at different times using photoluminescence anisotropy. This technique is sensitive to the rotational correlation time of the molecule under study, which is consequently related to the size of the molecule. [Ru(bpy)2(dpqp)]2+ presents anisotropy values of zero when free in solution (due to its rapid rotation and long lifetime) but larger values as the size and concentration of amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers increase. Our assays show that Abeta forms oligomers immediately after the assay is started, reaching a steady state at ~48 h. SDS-PAGE, DLS, and TEM were used to confirm and characterize the formation of oligomers. Our experiments show that the rate of formation for Abeta oligomers is temperature dependent, with faster rates as the temperature of the assay is increased. The probe was also effective in monitoring the formation of alpha-synuclein oligomers at different times.",

    "title": "Early administration of galantamine from preplaque phase suppresses oxidative stress and improves cognitive behavior in APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease that progressively impairs memory and cognition. Deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is the most important pathophysiological hallmark of AD. Oxidative stress induced by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a prominent phenomenon in AD and known to occur early in the course of AD. Several reports suggest a relationship between change in redox status and AD pathology including progressive Abeta deposition, glial cell activation, and inflammation. Galantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and has been reported to have an oxidative stress inhibitory function. In the present study, galantamine was administered orally to AD model mice from before the appearance of Abeta plaques (preplaque phase), and in vivo change in redox status of the brain was measured using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging. Administration of galantamine from the preplaque phase ameliorated memory decline in Morris water maze test and novel object recognition test. Monitoring of the redox status of the brain using EPR imaging showed that galantamine treatment improved the unbalanced redox state. Additionally, galantamine administration enhanced microglial function to promote Abeta clearance, reducing the Abeta-positive area in the cortex and amount of insoluble Abeta in the brain. In contrast, galantamine treatment from the preplaque phase suppressed the production of proinflammatory cytokines through neurotoxic microglial activity. Therefore, galantamine administration from the preplaque phase may have the potential of clinical application for the prevention of AD. In addition, our results demonstrate the usefulness of EPR imaging for speedy and quantitative evaluation of the efficacy of disease-modifying drugs for AD.",

    "title": "Unraveling the beta-amyloid clearance by astrocytes: Involvement of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3, sAPPalpha, and class-A scavenger receptor.",
    "abstract": "The mechanics of beta-amyloid (Abeta) clearance by astrocytes has not been univocally described, with different mediators appearing to contribute to this process under different conditions. Our laboratory has demonstrated neuroprotective effects of astroglial subtype 3 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGlu3R), which are dependent on the secreted form of the amyloid precursor protein (sAPPalpha) as well as on Abeta clearance; however, the mechanism underlying mGlu3R-induced Abeta uptake by astrocytes remains unclear. The present study shows that conditioned medium from mGlu3R-stimulated astrocytes increased Abeta uptake by naive astrocytes through a mechanism dependent on sAPPalpha, since sAPPalpha depletion from conditioned medium inhibited Abeta phagocytosis. Concordantly, recombinant sAPPalpha also increased Abeta uptake. Since we show that both sAPPalpha and the mGlu3R agonist LY379268 increased expression of class-A scavenger receptor (SR-A) in astrocytes, we next determined whether SR-A mediates mGlu3R- or sAPPalpha-induced Abeta uptake by using astrocyte cultures derived from SR-A knockout mice. We found that the effects of LY379268 as well as sAPPalpha on Abeta uptake were abolished in SR-A-deficient astrocytes, indicating a major role for this scavenger receptor in LY379268- and sAPPalpha-stimulated Abeta clearance by astrocytes. We also show results of coimmunoprecipitation and functional assays offering evidence of possible heterotrimerization of sAPPalpha with Abeta and SR-A which could allow Abeta to enter the astrocyte. In conclusion the present paper describes a novel pathway for Abeta clearance by astrocytes involving sAPPalpha as an enhancer of SR-A-dependent Abeta phagocytosis.",

    "title": "Amyloid-Beta Modulates Low-Threshold Activated Voltage-Gated L-Type Calcium Channels of Arcuate Neuropeptide Y Neurons Leading to Calcium Dysregulation and Hypothalamic Dysfunction.",
    "abstract": "Weight loss is an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease that can precede the cognitive decline, raising the possibility that amyloid-beta (Abeta) disrupts hypothalamic neurons critical for the regulation of body weight. We previously reported that, in young transgenic mice overexpressing mutated amyloid precursor protein (Tg2576), Abeta causes dysfunction in neuropeptide Y (NPY)-expressing hypothalamic arcuate neurons before plaque formation. In this study, we examined whether Abeta causes arcuate NPY neuronal dysfunction by disrupting intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Here, we found that the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nimodipine could hyperpolarize the membrane potential, decrease the spontaneous activity, and reduce the intracellular Ca2+ levels in arcuate NPY neurons from Tg2576 brain slices. In these neurons, there was a shift from high to low voltage-threshold activated L-type Ca2+ currents, resulting in increased Ca2+ influx closer to the resting membrane potential, an effect recapitulated by Abeta1-42 and reversed by nimodipine. These low voltage-threshold activated L-type Ca2+ currents were dependent in part on calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and IP3 pathways. Furthermore, the effects on intracellular Ca2+ signaling by both a positive (ghrelin) and negative (leptin) modulator were blunted in these neurons. Nimodipine pretreatment restored the response to ghrelin-mediated feeding in young (3-5 months), but not older (10 months), female Tg2576 mice, suggesting that intracellular Ca2+ dysregulation is only reversible early in Abeta pathology. Collectively, these findings provide evidence for a key role for low-threshold activated voltage gated L-type Ca2+ channels in Abeta-mediated neuronal dysfunction and in the regulation of body weight.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Weight loss is one of the earliest manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying cellular mechanisms remain unknown. Disruption of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis by amyloid-beta is hypothesized to be critical for the early neuronal dysfunction driving AD pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that amyloid-beta causes a shift from high to low voltage-threshold activated L-type Ca2+ currents in arcuate neuropeptide Y neurons. This leads to increased Ca2+ influx closer to the resting membrane potential, resulting in intracellular Ca2+ dyshomeostasis and neuronal dysfunction, an effect reversible by the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nimodipine early in amyloid-beta pathology. These findings highlight a novel mechanism of amyloid-beta-mediated neuronal dysfunction through L-type Ca2+ channels and the importance of these channels in the regulation of body weight.",

For instance, >50% PD patients develop dementia in their later stages, though it is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. In fact, latest research has suggested the involvement of some common pathophysiological and genetic links between these diseases, including the deposition of pathological Abeta, Tau, and alpha-synuclein in both the cases. Therefore, it is pertinent to diagnose the shared biomarkers, their aggregation mechanism, their intricate relationships in the pathophysiology of disease and therapeutic markers to target them. This would enable us to identify novel markers for the early detection of disease and targets for the future therapies. Herein, we investigated molecular aspects of Abeta, Tau, and alpha-Synuclein aggregation, and characterized their functional partners involved in the pathology of AD and PD. Moreover, we identified the molecular-crosstalk between AD and PD associated with their pathogenic proteins- Abeta, Tau, and alpha-Synuclein.

    "title": "Aminoacid substitutions in the glycine zipper affect the conformational stability of amyloid beta fibrils.",
    "abstract": "The aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides is associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The hydrophobic core of the amyloid beta sequence contains a GxxxG repeated motif, called glycine zipper, which involves crucial residues for assuring stability and promoting the process of fibril formation. Mutations in this motif lead to a completely different oligomerization pathway and rate of fibril formation. In this work, we have tested G33L and G37L residue substitutions by molecular dynamics simulations. We found that both protein mutations may lead to remarkable changes in the fibril conformational stability. Results suggest the disruption of the glycine zipper as a possible strategy to reduce the aggregation propensity of amyloid beta peptides. On the basis of our data, further investigations may consider this key region as a binding site to design/discover novel effective inhibitors.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

    "abstract": "Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are pathological hallmarks in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the constituents of these hallmarks, amyloid beta (Abeta) 40, Abeta42, and total Tau (t-Tau), have been detected in the blood of cognitively normal subjects by using an immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) assay. Whether these levels are age-dependent is not known, and their interrelation remains undefined. We determined the levels of these biomarkers in cognitively normal subjects of different age groups. A total of 391 cognitively normal subjects aged 23-91 were enrolled from hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America. Healthy cognition was evaluated by NIA-AA guidelines to exclude subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD and by cognitive assessment using the Mini Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). We examined the effect of age on plasma levels of Abeta40, Abeta42, and t-Tau and the relationship between these biomarkers during aging. Additionally, we explored age-related reference intervals for each biomarker. Plasma t-Tau and Abeta42 levels had modest but significant correlations with chronological age (r = 0.127, p = 0.0120 for t-Tau; r = -0.126, p = 0.0128 for Abeta42), ranging from ages 23 to 91. Significant positive correlations were detected between Abeta42 and t-Tau in the groups aged 50 years and older, with Rho values ranging from 0.249 to 0.474. Significant negative correlations were detected between Abeta40 and t-Tau from age 40 to 91 (r ranged from -0.293 to -0.582) and between Abeta40 and Abeta42 in the age groups of 30-39 (r = -0.562, p = 0.0235), 50-59 (r = -0.261, p = 0.0142), 60-69 (r = -0.303, p = 0.0004), and 80-91 (r = 0.459, p = 0.0083). We also provided age-related reference intervals for each biomarker. In this multicenter study, age had weak but significant effects on the levels of Abeta42 and t-Tau in plasma. However, the age group defined by decade revealed the emergence of a relationship between Abeta40, Abeta42, and t-Tau in the 6th and 7th decades. Validation of our findings in a large-scale and longitudinal study is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Umbelliferone has been demonstrated to have a wide range of biological activities. However, the effect of incorporating a formyl moiety in the umbelliferone scaffold has not been investigated. In this paper, we investigated the inhibitory activity of six coumarins, namely umbelliferone (1), 6-formyl umbelliferone (2), 8-formyl umbelliferone (3), umbelliferone-6-carboxylic acid (4), esculetin (5), and scopoletin (6) against human monoamine oxidases (hMAOs), self-amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation, and lipid peroxidation. We found that all compounds had high selectivity for hMAO-A in comparison with hMAO-B. Among the compounds, 2 exhibited the highest hMAO inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 3.23 microM for hMAO-A and 15.31 microM for hMAO-B. Enzyme kinetic analysis showed that 2 and 3 were competitive hMAO inhibitors. In silico hydrated molecular docking simulations revealed that the coumarins interacted with substrate-binding site residues of the enzymes and the isoalloxazine ring of FAD. In addition, formyl coumarins 2 and 3 significantly inhibited lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenates and self-Abeta25-35 aggregation compared to other derivatives. These represent the first experimental and modelling data for hMAO-A/B inhibition by umbelliferone derivatives. Together, the data suggest that introduction of a formyl moiety in the 7-hydroxycoumarin scaffold, especially at the 6 position, plays an important role in the inhibition of hMAOs, Abeta self-aggregation, and lipid peroxidation. Umbelliferone derivative 2 is a promising therapeutic lead scaffold for developing anti-neuropsychiatric disorder drugs that function via selective hMAO-A inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Systemic inflammation enhances the risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent pro-inflammatory endotoxin produced by the gut, is found in excess levels in AD where it associates with neurological hallmarks of pathology. Sex differences in susceptibility to inflammation and AD progression have been reported, but how this impacts on LPS responses remains under investigated. We previously reported in an APP/PS1 model of AD that systemic LPS administration rapidly altered hippocampal metabolism in males. Here, we used untargeted metabolomics to comprehensively identify hippocampal metabolic processes occurring at onset of systemic inflammation with LPS (100 microg/kg, i.v.) in APP/PS1 mice, at an early pathological stage, and investigated the sexual dimorphism in this response. Four hours after LPS administration, pathways regulating energy metabolism, immune and oxidative stress responses were simultaneously recruited in the hippocampi of 4.5-month-old mice with a more protective response in females despite their pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant metabolic signature in the absence of immune stimulation. LPS induced comparable behavioural sickness responses in male and female wild-type and APP/PS1 mice and comparable activation of both the serotonin and nicotinamide pathways of tryptophan metabolism in their hippocampi. Elevations in N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, a major toxic metabolite of nicotinamide, correlated with behavioural sickness regardless of sex, as well as with the LPS-induced hypothermia seen in males. Males also exhibited a pro-inflammatory-like downregulation of pyruvate metabolism, exacerbated in APP/PS1 males, and methionine metabolism whereas females showed a greater cytokine response and anti-inflammatory-like downregulation of hippocampal methylglyoxal and methionine metabolism. Metabolic changes were not associated with morphological markers of immune cell activation suggesting that they constitute an early event in the development of LPS-induced neuroinflammation and AD exacerbation. These data suggest that the female hippocampus is more tolerant to acute systemic inflammation.",

Subjects were divided into three groups according to their CSF biomarker profile: 37 control participants (negative CSF AD biomarkers, CTR), 20 cognitively normal subjects with amyloid-beta positivity (abnormal levels of CSF Abeta42, Abeta+) and 15 AD patients. All subjects underwent lumbar puncture for the CSF analysis, apolipoprotein E genotyping and completed the Finger Tapping Task, a neuropsychological battery and cardiovascular risk factor and physical activity assessments. An overall difference between groups was found both in tapping speed [F(2,66) = 19.37, p < .01] and in intrasubject variability [F(2,66) = 11.40, p < .01]. More specifically, the Abeta+ group showed lower speed [F(1,52) = 5.33, p < .05] and greater intrasubject variability [F(1,52) = 8.48, p < .01] than the CTR group, and higher speed than the AD group [F(1,30) = 13.61, p < .01]. Speed (beta = .263, p < .05) and intrasubject variability (beta = -.558, p < .01) were significantly associated with CSF amyloid-beta levels. The present findings suggest that subtle motor difficulties can be detected in cognitively healthy subjects with amyloid-beta positivity and be related to CSF Abeta42 levels. An accurate assessment of motor functions could help on identifying individuals at the earliest stage of the Alzheimer's continuum.",

    "abstract": "It is now more than two decades since amyloid-beta (Abeta), the proteolytic product of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP), was first demonstrated to be a normal and soluble product of neuronal metabolism. To date, despite a growing body of evidence suggests its regulatory role on synaptic function, the exact cellular and molecular pathways involved in Abeta-driven synaptic effects remain elusive. This review provides an overview of the mounting evidence showing Abeta-mediated effects on presynaptic functions and neurotransmitter release from axon terminals, focusing on its interaction with synaptic vesicle cycle. Indeed, Abeta peptides have been found to interact with key presynaptic scaffold proteins and kinases affecting the consequential steps of the synaptic vesicle dynamics (e.g., synaptic vesicles exocytosis, endocytosis, and trafficking). Defects in the fine-tuning of synaptic vesicle cycle by Abeta and deregulation of key molecules and kinases, which orchestrate synaptic vesicle availability, may alter synaptic homeostasis, possibly contributing to synaptic loss and cognitive decline. Elucidating the presynaptic mechanisms by which Abeta regulate synaptic transmission is fundamental for a deeper comprehension of the biology of presynaptic terminals as well as of Abeta-driven early synaptic defects occurring in prodromal stage of AD. Moreover, a better understating of Abeta involvement in cellular signal pathways may allow to set up more effective therapeutic interventions by detecting relevant molecular mechanisms, whose imbalance might ultimately lead to synaptic impairment in AD.",

    "abstract": "A system of partial differential equations is developed to describe the formation and clearance of amyloid beta (Abeta) and the subsequent buildup of Abeta plaques in the brain, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease. The Abeta related proteins are divided into five distinct categories depending on their size. In addition to enzymatic degradation, the clearance via diffusion and the outflow of interstitial fluid (ISF) into the surrounding cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) are considered. Treating the brain tissue as a porous medium, a simplified two-dimensional circular geometry is assumed for the transverse section of the brain leading to a nonlinear, coupled system of PDEs. Asymptotic analysis is carried out for the steady states of the spatially homogeneous system in the vanishingly small limit of Abeta clearance rate. The PDE model is studied numerically for two cases, a spherically symmetric case and a more realistic 2D asymmetric case, allowing for non-uniform boundary conditions. Our investigations demonstrate that ISF advection is a key component in reproducing the clinically observed accumulation of plaques on the outer boundaries. Furthermore, ISF circulation serves to enhance Abeta clearance over diffusion alone and that non-uniformities in ISF drainage into the CSF can lead to local clustering of plaques. Analysis of the model also demonstrates that plaque formation does not directly correspond to the high presence of toxic oligomers.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation and deposition of neurotoxic Abeta fibrils are key in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been clinically recognized as a major form of dementia across the globe. Finding and testing various natural compounds to target Abeta fibrils to disrupt their stable structures seems to be a promising and attractive therapeutic strategy. The destabilization effects of caffeine on Abeta fibrils are investigated via in silico studies, where a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, each of 100 ns, was conducted. The simulation outcomes obtained henceforth clearly indicated the drift of the terminal chains from the protofibrils, leading to disorganization of the characteristically organized cross-beta structures of Abeta fibrils. The structural instability of Abeta17-42 protofibrils is explained through enhanced fluctuations in the RMSD, radius of gyration and RMSF values in the presence of caffeine. The key interactions providing stability, comprising D23-K28 salt bridges, intra- and inter-chain hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions involving interchain A21-V36 and F19-G38 and intrachain L34-V36, were found to be disrupted due to increases in the distances between the participating components. The loss of beta-sheet structure with the introduction of turns and alpha-helices in terminal chains may further inhibit the formation of higher order aggregates, which is necessary to stop the progression of the disease. The atomistic details obtained via MD studies relating to the mechanism behind the underlying destabilization of Abeta17-42 protofibrils by caffeine encourage further investigations exploring the potency of natural compounds to treat AD via disrupting preformed neurotoxic Abeta protofibrils.",

Using 2H static solid-state NMR approaches, we compare the dynamics in the wild-type Abeta fibrils in the threefold symmetric polymorph with the fibrils from three post-translational modification sequences: isoaspartate-D7, the phosphorylation of S8, and an N-terminal truncation DeltaE3. Additional comparisons are made with the mutants in the beta-bend region (residues 21-23) corresponding to the familial Osaka E22Delta deletion and D23N Iowa mutation. We also include the aggregates induced by Zn2+ ions. The dynamics are probed at the F4 and G9 positions. The main motional model involves two free states undergoing diffusion and conformational exchanges with the bound state in which the diffusion is quenched because of transient interactions involving fibril core and other intrastrand contacts. The fraction of the bound state increases in a sigmoidal fashion with a decrease in temperature. There is clear variability in the dynamics: the phosphorylation of S8 variant is the most rigid at the G9 site in line with structural studies, the DeltaE3 fibrils are more flexible at the G9 site in line with the morphological fragmentation pattern, the Zn-induced aggregates are the most mobile, and the two beta-bend mutants have the strongest changes at the F4 site toward higher rigidity. Overall, the changes underlie the potential role of conformational ensembles in setting the stage for aggregation-prone states.",

Physical damage to intermediates did not suppress, but instead promoted fibrillization. This progression was accompanied by morphological changes from globular oligomers to protofibrils.

Indeed, somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) increase with age in the human brain, in a somewhat stochastic process that may nonetheless be controlled by underlying genetic programs. Evidence from the literature suggests that in addition to demonstrated increases in somatic SNVs during aging in normal brains, somatic mutation may also play a role in late-onset, sporadic neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In this review, we will discuss somatic mutation in the human brain, mechanisms by which somatic mutations occur and can be controlled, and how this process can impact human health.",

    "abstract": "The early stage of secondary structural conversion of amyloid beta (Abeta) to misfolded aggregations is a key feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Under normal physiological conditions, Abeta peptides can protect neurons from the toxicity of highly concentrated metals. However, they become toxic under certain conditions. Under conditions of excess iron, amyloid precursor proteins (APP) become overexpressed. This subsequently increases Abeta production. Experimental studies suggest that Abeta fibrillation (main-pathway) and amorphous (off-pathway) aggregate formations are two competitive pathways driven by factors such as metal binding, pH and temperature. In this study, we performed molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to examine the initial stage of conformational transformations of human Abeta (hAbeta) and rat Abeta (rAbeta) peptides in the presence of Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions. Our results demonstrated that Fe2+ and Fe3+ play key roles in Abetas folding and aggregation. Fe3+ had a greater effect than Fe2+on Abetas' folding during intermolecular interactions and subsequently, had a greater effect in decreasing structural diversity. Fe2+ was observed to be more likely than Fe3+ to interact with nitrogen atoms from the residues of imidazole rings of His. rAbeta peptides are more energetically favorable than hAbeta for intermolecular interactions and amorphous aggregations. We concluded that most hAbeta structures were energetically unfavorable. However, hAbetas with intermolecular beta-sheet formations in the C-terminal were energetically favorable. It is notable that Fe2+ can change the surface charge of hAbeta. Furthermore, Fe3+ can promote C-terminal folding by binding to Glu22 and Ala42, and by forming stable beta-sheet formations on the C-terminal. Fe3+ can also pause the main-pathway by inducing random aggregations.",

    "title": "Stavudine Reduces NLRP3 Inflammasome Activation and Modulates Amyloid-beta Autophagy.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) within senile plaques in the brain and neuroinflammation, possibly driven by the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) hamper the NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. OBJECTIVE: We utilized an in vitro model reproducing the Abeta-driven inflammation seen in AD to analyze whether stavudine (D4T), a prototypical NRTI, modulates Abeta-mediated inflammasome activation and the ability of macrophages to eliminate Abeta via phagocytosis and autophagy. METHODS: THP-1-derived macrophages were stimulated in vitro with Abeta42 or with Abeta42 after LPS-priming in the presence/absence of D4T. NLRP3 and TREM2 expression was analyzed by RT-PCR; phagocytosis, as well as ASC-Speck formation, was analyzed by Amnis FlowSight Imaging; NLRP3-produced cytokines were quantified by ELISA and, finally, autophagy was analyzed by measuring p-ERK1/2, p-AKT, beclin, p70-S6Kinase, and Lamp by ELISA and western blot. RESULTS: IL-1beta, IL-18, and caspase-1 were increased whereas Abeta phagocytosis and TREM2 were reduced in LPS+Abeta42-stimulated cells. D4T reduced NLRP3 assembly as well as IL-18 and caspase-1 production, but did not affect IL-1beta production and TREM2 expression. Notably, whereas D4T reduced Abeta phagocytosis, Abeta autophagy by macrophages was stimulated by D4T, as witnessed by the down-modulation of ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation and the upregulation of beclin, LAMP, and p70-S6K, their downstream targets. CONCLUSION: In this in vitro model of AD, D4T reduces NLRP3 inflammasome-associated inflammation and stimulates Abeta autophagy by macrophages. It will be interesting to verify the possibly beneficial effects of D4T in the clinical scenario.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain is the most significant pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have found that chronic systemic exposure to lipopolysaccharide of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) induces the accumulation of Abeta in the brain of middle-aged mice. On the other hand, recent research has shown that circulating Abeta is transferred into the brain; however, the involvement of chronic systemic P. gingivalis infection in the peripheral Abeta metabolism is unknown. We hypothesized that chronic P. gingivalis infection expands Abeta pools in peripheral inflammatory tissues and thereby contributes to the accumulation of Abeta in the brain of patients with periodontitis. We showed that the increased expression of IL-1beta, AbetaPP770, CatB, Abeta1-42, and Abeta3-42 was mainly co-localized with macrophages in the liver of P. gingivalis infected mice. Blocking CatB and NF-kappaB significantly inhibited the P. gingivalis-induced expression of IL-1beta, AbetaPP770, Abeta1-42, and Abeta3-42 in RAW264.7 cells. Abeta3-42, but not Abeta1-42, induced the significant death of macrophages, and the reduction of phagocytic abilities induced by Abeta3-42 tended to be higher than that induced by Abeta1-42. Additionally, the expression of AbetaPP770, CatB, Abeta1-42, and Abeta3-42 was determined in the macrophages of gingival tissues from periodontitis patients. These findings indicate that chronic systemic P. gingivalis infection induces the Abeta accumulation in inflammatory monocytes/macrophages via the activation of CatB/NF-kappaB signaling, thus suggesting monocytes/macrophages serve as a circulating pool of Abeta in patients with periodontitis. Taken together, CatB may be a novel therapeutic target for preventing the periodontitis-related AD initiation and pathological progression.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion changes as determined by diffusion tensor imaging are potential indicators of microstructural lesions in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD), and AD dementia. Here we extended the scope of analysis toward subjective cognitive complaints as a pre-MCI at risk stage of AD. In a cohort of 271 participants of the prospective DELCODE study, including 93 healthy controls and 98 subjective cognitive decline (SCD), 45 MCI, and 35 AD dementia cases, we found reductions of fiber tract integrity in limbic and association fiber tracts in MCI and AD dementia compared with controls in a tract-based analysis (p < 0.05, family wise error corrected). In contrast, people with SCD showed spatially restricted white matter alterations only for the mode of anisotropy and only at an uncorrected level of significance. DTI parameters yielded a high cross-validated diagnostic accuracy of almost 80% for the clinical diagnosis of MCI and the discrimination of Abeta positive MCI cases from Abeta negative controls. In contrast, DTI parameters reached only random level accuracy for the discrimination between Abeta positive SCD and control cases from Abeta negative controls. These findings suggest that in prodromal stages of AD, such as in Abeta positive MCI, multicenter DTI with prospectively harmonized acquisition parameters yields diagnostic accuracy meeting the criteria for a useful biomarker. In contrast, automated tract-based analysis of DTI parameters is not useful for the identification of preclinical AD, including Abeta positive SCD and control cases.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin Specific Protease-13 (USP13) is a de-ubiquinating enzyme that regulates protein ubiquitination and clearance. The role of USP13 is largely unknown in neurodegeneration. In this study we aim to demonstrate whether tau accumulation and/or clearance depends on ubiquitination/de-ubiquitination via USP-13. We used transgenic animal models of human amyloid precursor protein (APP) or P301L tau mutations and genetically knocked-down USP13 expression via shRNA to determine USP13 effects on tau ubiquitination and levels. We found a two-fold increase of USP13 levels in postmortem Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. USP13 knockdown significantly increased the activity of the 20S proteasome and reduced the levels of hyper-phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in primary cortical neurons. USP13 knockdown also reduced the levels of amyloid and increased p-tau ubiquitination and clearance in transgenic animal models that overexpress murine tau as a result of the expression of familial APP mutations (TgAPP) and the human mutant P301L tau (rTg4510), respectively. Clearance of p-tau appears to be mediated by autophagy in these animal models. Taken together, these data suggest that USP13 knockdown reduces p-tau accumulation via regulation of ubiquitination/de-ubiquitination and mediates its clearance via autophagy and/or the proteasome. These results suggest that USP13 inhibition may be a therapeutic strategy to reduce accumulation of plaques and toxic p-tau in AD and human tauopathies.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a heterogeneous group of secreted particles consisting of microvesicles, which are released by budding of the cellular membrane, and exosomes, which are secreted through exocytosis from multivesicular bodies. EV cargo consists of a wide range of proteins and nucleic acids that can be transferred between cells. Importantly, EVs may be pathogenically involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). While EVs derived from AD neurons have been found to be neurotoxic in vitro, little is known about the pathological consequences of AD EVs in vivo. Furthermore, although all known familial AD (fAD) mutations involve either amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) or the machinery that processes AbetaPP, hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule associated protein tau appears to play a critical role in fAD-associated neurodegeneration, and previous reports suggest EVs may propagate tau pathology in the AD brain. Therefore, we hypothesized that fAD EVs may have a mechanistic involvement in the development of fAD-associated tau pathology. To test this, we isolated EVs from iPSC-derived neuronal cultures generated from an fAD patient harboring a A246E mutation to presenilin-1 and stereotactically injected these EVs into the hippocampi of wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Five weeks after injection, mice were euthanized and pathology evaluated. Mice injected with fAD EVs displayed increased tau phosphorylation at multiple sites relative to PBS and non-disease control EV injected groups. Moreover, fAD EV injected hippocampi contained significantly more tau inclusions in the CA1 hippocampal neuronal field than controls. In total, these findings identify EVs as a potential mediator of fAD-associated tau dysregulation and warrant future studies to investigate the therapeutic potential of EV-targeted treatments for fAD.",

    "title": "Differential Roles of Plasma Protein Corona on Immune Cell Association and Cytokine Secretion of Oligomeric and Fibrillar Beta-Amyloid.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a primary neurological disease with no effective cure. A hallmark of AD is the presence of intracellular tangles and extracellular plaques derived from the aberrant aggregation of tau- and beta-amyloid (Abeta). Abeta presents in the brain as well as in cerebrospinal fluid and the circulation, and Abeta toxicity has been attributed to amyloidosis and inflammation, among other causes. In this study, the effects of the plasma protein corona have been investigated with regard to the blood cell association and cytokine secretion of oligomeric (Abetao) and fibrillar Abeta1-42(Abetaf), two major forms of the peptide aggregates. Abetao displayed little change in membrane association in whole blood or washed blood (i.e., cells in the absence of plasma proteins) at 37  C, while Abetaf showed a clear preference for binding with all cell types sans plasma proteins. Immune cells exposed to Abetao, but not to Abetaf, resulted in significant expression of cytokines IL-6 and TNF measured in real-time by a localized surface plasmon resonance sensor. These observations indicate greater immune cell association and cytokine stimulation of Abetao than Abetaf and shed new light on the contrasting toxicities of Abetao and Abetaf resulting from their differential capacities in acquiring a plasma protein corona. These results further implicate a close connection between Abeta amyloidosis and immunopathology in AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease leading to progressive dementia in elderly people. The disease is characterized, among others, by formation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) polypeptide plaques in the brain. Although etiology of the disease is not fully understood, recent research suggest that nanomaterials may affect AD development. Here, we described the consequences of exposure of mouse BV-2 microglia to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs, 50 microg/mL), cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2NPs, 100 microg/mL), and cadmium telluride quantum dots (CdTeQDs, 3 or 10 microg/mL) in the context of its ability to clear Abeta plaques. The brain microglial cells play an important role in removing Abeta plaques from the brain. Cell viability and cycle progression were assessed by trypan blue test and propidium iodide binding, respectively. The uptake of Abeta and NPs was measured by flow cytometry. Secretion of proinflammatory cytokines was measured with the use of cytometric bead array. Abeta (0.1 muM) did not affect viability, whereas NPs decreased microglia growth by arresting the cells in G1 phase (CdTeQDs) or in S phase (AgNPs and CeO2NPs) of cell cycle. The uptake of Abeta was significantly reduced in the presence of AgNPs and CeO2NPs. In addition, the least toxic CeO2NPs induced the release of proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha. In summary, each of the NPs tested affected either the microglia phagocytic activity (AgNPs and CeO2NPs) and/or its viability (AgNPs and CdTeQDs) that may favor the occurrence of AD and accelerate its development.",

    "title": "Plasma neurofilament light chain and amyloid-beta are associated with the kynurenine pathway metabolites in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Blood markers indicative of neurodegeneration (neurofilament light chain; NFL), Alzheimer's disease amyloid pathology (amyloid-beta; Abeta), and neuroinflammation (kynurenine pathway; KP metabolites) have been investigated independently in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the association of these markers of neurodegeneration and AD pathology with neuroinflammation has not been investigated previously. Therefore, the current study examined whether NFL and Abeta correlate with KP metabolites in elderly individuals to provide insight on the association between blood indicators of neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. METHODS: Correlations between KP metabolites, measured using liquid chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, and plasma NFL and Abeta concentrations, measured using single molecule array (Simoa) assays, were investigated in elderly individuals aged 65-90 years, with normal global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination Score >= 26) from the Kerr Anglican Retirement Village Initiative in Ageing Health cohort. RESULTS: A positive correlation between NFL and the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (K/T) reflecting indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity was observed (r = .451, p < .0001). Positive correlations were also observed between NFL and kynurenine (r = .364, p < .0005), kynurenic acid (r = .384, p < .0001), 3-hydroxykynurenine (r = .246, p = .014), anthranilic acid (r = .311, p = .002), and quinolinic acid (r = .296, p = .003). Further, significant associations were observed between plasma Abeta40 and the K/T (r = .375, p < .0005), kynurenine (r = .374, p < .0005), kynurenic acid (r = .352, p < .0005), anthranilic acid (r = .381, p < .0005), and quinolinic acid (r = .352, p < .0005). Significant associations were also observed between plasma Abeta42 and the K/T ratio (r = .215, p = .034), kynurenic acid (r = .214, p = .035), anthranilic acid (r = .278, p = .006), and quinolinic acid (r = .224, p = .027) in the cohort. On stratifying participants based on their neocortical Abeta load (NAL) status, NFL correlated with KP metabolites irrespective of NAL status; however, associations between plasma Abeta and KP metabolites were only pronounced in individuals with high NAL while associations in individuals with low NAL were nearly absent. CONCLUSIONS: The current study shows that KP metabolite changes are associated with biomarker evidence of neurodegeneration. Additionally, the association between KP metabolites and plasma Abeta seems to be NAL status dependent. Finally, the current study suggests that an association between neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation manifests in the periphery, suggesting that preventing cytoskeleton cytotoxicity by KP metabolites may have therapeutic potential.",

Many studies have sought to predict cerebral amyloid deposition, the major pathological hallmark of AD, using body fluids such as blood or cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). The use of blood in diagnostic procedures is widespread in medicine; however, existing blood biomarkers for AD remain unreliable. We sought to discover blood biomarkers that discriminate Abeta deposition status in the brain. This study used 107 individuals who were cognitively normal (CN), 107 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 40 AD patients with Pittsburg compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) amyloid imaging data available. We found five plasma biomarker candidates via mass spectrometry (MS) based-proteomic analysis and validated these proteins using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our integrated models were highly predictive of brain amyloid deposition, exhibiting 0.871 accuracy with 79% sensitivity and 84% specificity overall, and 0.836 accuracy with 68% sensitivity and 90% specificity in patients with MCI. These results indicated that a combination of proteomic-based blood proteins might be a possible biomarker set for predicting cerebral amyloid deposition.",

METHODS: Logistic mixed model regression and survival analyses were performed in a sample of 3067 Caribbean Hispanics and 3028 individuals of European descent to assess the effects of APOE genotype, local ancestry, and genome-wide ancestry on AD risk and age at onset. RESULTS: Among the Caribbean Hispanics, individuals with African-derived ancestry at APOE had 39% lower odds of AD than individuals with European-derived APOE, after adjusting for APOE genotype, age, and genome-wide ancestry. While APOE E2 and E4 effects on AD risk and age at onset were significant in the Caribbean Hispanics, they were substantially attenuated compared with those in European ancestry individuals. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that additional genetic variation in the APOE region influences AD risk beyond APOE E2/E3/E4.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized neuropathologically by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, major components of amyloid plaques and crucial pathogenic molecules in terms of the amyloid hypothesis, are derived from successive proteolytic processing of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP). In this study, we established a human neuronal culture system using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to evaluate the possible effects of natural compounds on the amyloid phenotype. Unexpectedly, we found that combinational treatment of carotenoids, but not docosahexaenoic acid, significantly decreased Abeta secretion from iPSC-derived human cortical neurons. Importantly, the effects of the carotenoids resulted from specific inhibition of BACE1 activity and not from expression changes in APP or BACE1. Therefore, these results indicate a novel beneficial function of carotenoids in the anti-amyloidogenic processing of APP. Collectively, this study will shed light on neuronal protection by a novel mechanism during the pathogenesis of AD.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is critical in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), since two-step proteolytic processing of AbetaPP generates the neurotoxic amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). We developed a dual fluorescence labeling system to study the exact subcellular location of gamma-secretase cleavage of AbetaPP. The C-terminal tail of AbetaPP was fluorescently labeled using a SNAP-tag, while the Abeta region of AbetaPP was fluorescently tagged with a dye at a genetically-encoded noncanonical amino acid (ncAA). The ncAA was introduced at specific positions in AbetaPP using a genetic code expansion strategy and afterwards, the reactive side-chain of the ncAA was coupled to the dye using a bioorthogonal labeling chemistry. In proof-of-concept experiments, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids containing engineered AbetaPP harboring an amber mutation and an amber codon suppression system with an evolved tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair and grown in the presence of a lysine-derived ncAA. Processing of the AbetaPP variants was validated with ELISA and immunoblotting, and seven AbetaPP mutants that showed similar cleavage pattern as wild-type AbetaPP were identified. The AbetaPP mutant was fluorescently labeled with 6-methyl-tetrazine-BDP-FL and TMR-Star at the ncAA and SNAP-tag, respectively. Using this approach, AbetaPP was fluorescently labeled at two sites in living cells with minimal background to allow monitoring of Abeta and C-terminal cleavage products simultaneously. The method described provides a powerful tool to label Abeta with minimal perturbations of its processing, thus enabling studies of the trafficking of the cleavage products of AbetaPP.",

    "title": "Hospitalization, Alzheimer's Disease and Related Neuropathologies, and Cognitive Decline.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease and related neuropathologies contribute to the association between hospitalization and cognitive decline in old age. METHODS: As part of a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study, 526 older persons (mean age at death = 90.9 years, 71% female) without dementia at baseline completed annual cognitive testing and were autopsied at death. Hospitalization information was obtained from linked Medicare claims records. Neuropathologic examination assessed beta-amyloid burden, tau tangle density, neocortical Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, chronic gross and microscopic cerebral infarcts, and transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa. RESULTS: Over a mean of 5.1 years, a total of 1,383 hospitalizations occurred, and the mean annual rate of hospitalization was 0.5 (standard deviation = 0.6, median = 0.4). Higher rate of hospitalization was not directly related to higher burden for any of the neuropathologic markers. Higher rate of hospitalization was associated with more rapid cognitive decline (estimate = -0.042, standard error [SE] = 0.012, p < 0.001), and after controlling for all 7 neuropathologic markers, the association was essentially the same (estimate = -0.040, SE = 0.013, p = 0.002). In a multivariable model with 3-way interactions of neuropathologic markers with hospitalization rate and time, the association between hospitalization rate and faster cognitive decline was greater in persons with more tangle pathology (estimate for interaction = -0.007, SE = 0.002, p = 0.002) and in persons with neocortical Lewy bodies (estimate for interaction = -0.117, SE = 0.042, p = 0.005). INTERPRETATION: Older persons with more hospitalizations experienced faster rates of cognitive decline, and this association was more pronounced in persons with more tau tangle density and with neocortical Lewy body pathologies.

Increasing evidence suggests that pathological proteins in neurodegenerative diseases adopt prion-like mechanisms and spread across the brain along anatomically connected networks. Local kinetic models of protein misfolding and global network models of protein spreading provide valuable insight into several aspects of prion-like diseases. Yet, to date, these models have not been combined to simulate how pathological proteins multiply and spread across the human brain. Here, we create an efficient and robust tool to simulate the spreading of misfolded protein using three classes of kinetic models, the Fisher-Kolmogorov model, the Heterodimer model and the Smoluchowski model. We discretize their governing equations using a human brain network model, which we represent as a weighted Laplacian graph generated from 418 brains from the Human Connectome Project. Its nodes represent the anatomic regions of interest and its edges are weighted by the mean fibre number divided by the mean fibre length between any two regions. We demonstrate that our brain network model can predict the histopathological patterns of Alzheimer's disease and capture the key characteristic features of finite-element brain models at a fraction of their computational cost: simulating the spatio-temporal evolution of aggregate size distributions across the human brain throughout a period of 40 years takes less than 7 s on a standard laptop computer. Our model has the potential to predict biomarker curves, aggregate size distributions, infection times, and the effects of therapeutic strategies including reduced production and increased clearance of misfolded protein.",

    "title": "Development of Kinase Inactive PD173955 Analogues for Reducing Production of Abeta Peptides.",
    "abstract": "Compound 3a, DV2-103, is a kinase inactive analogue of a potent Abl1/Src kinase inhibitor, PD173955, 2. Both compounds, 2 and 3a, are known to reduce production of beta amyloid (Abeta) peptide in cells and animal models. We have now prepared and evaluated a series of PD-173955 analogues, several of which reduced Abeta production potently. This occurs in cells expressing human full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP) and not in cells expressing APP beta-C terminal fragment (APP-C99), suggesting that the kinase inactive analogues strongly affect beta-secretase (BACE1) cleavage of APP, similarly to Gleevec. A combination of the kinase inactive analogues of PD173955 with a BACE1 inhibitor (BACEi), namely, BACE IV, strongly reduced Abeta levels in cells, as noted previously with Gleevec and analogues. Several potent compounds also penetrated and accumulated in mouse brain in high nanomolar to low micromolar concentration.",

    "title": "Intraventricular murine Abeta infusion elicits hippocampal inflammation and disrupts the consolidation, but not retrieval, of conditioned fear in C57BL6/J mice.",
    "abstract": "Although one of the defining characteristics of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, the early accumulation of soluble Abeta oligomers (AbetaOs) may disrupt synaptic function and trigger cognitive impairments long before the appearance of plaques. Furthermore, murine models aimed at understanding how AbetaOs alter formation and retrieval of associative memories are conducted using human Abeta species, which are more neurotoxic in the mouse brain than the native murine species. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of attention in the literature as to what the murine version of the peptide (mAbeta) does to synaptic function and how it impacts the consolidation and retrieval of associative memories. In the current study, adult mice were infused with mAbeta 0, 2, 6, or 46 h after contextual-fear conditioning, and were tested 2-48 h later. Interestingly, only mAbeta infusions within 2 h of training reduced freezing behavior at test, indicating that mAbeta disrupted the consolidation, but not retrieval of fear memory. This consolidation deficit coincided with increased IL-1beta and reduced synaptophysin mRNA levels, without disrupting other synaptic signaling-related genes here examined. Despite differences between murine and human Abeta, the deleterious functional outcomes of early-stage synaptic oligomer presence are similar. Thus, models utilizing or inducing the production of mAbeta in non-transgenic animals are useful in exploring the role of dysregulated synaptic plasticity and resultant learning deficits induced by Abeta oligomers.",

    "abstract": "Combining of amperometric and square wave voltammetric methods (SWV), the dual-signal sandwich electrochemical immunosensor was developed for quantitative determination of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta). Cu was doped into Al2O3 lattice (Cu-Al2O3) and reacts with graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) to generate Cu-Al2O3-g-C3N4 with internal dual-reaction center structure, which has good catalytic properties of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Subsequently, palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) was introduced into Cu-Al2O3-g-C3N4 (Cu-Al2O3-g-C3N4-Pd) that not only synergistically catalyzed H2O2 but also immobilized anti-Abeta (Ab1) via Pd-NH2. The Cu-Al2O3-g-C3N4-Pd was used as matrix material to modify the electrode, which can produce obviously electrochemical signals through Amperometry i-t curve. Meanwhile, the Zr6O4(OH)4(CO2)12 (UiO-66) modified with polyaniline (PANI) has the large specific surface, good conductivity and adsorption capacity, which can support methylene blue (MB) as signal label of anti-Abeta (Ab2). Therefore, the UiO-66@PANI-MB can provide an obviously electrochemical signal about MB through SWV. Under optimal conditions, the dual-signal sandwich electrochemical immunosensor has salient analytical performance and both signal platforms provide more accurate results. The linear range of detection obtained by the immunosensor was 10 fg/mL-100 ng/mL, and the detection limit was 3.3 fg/mL. This method not only provided a reliable guarantee for the experimental detection but also provided an effective strategy for the detection of other biological.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The ratio of beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta42) to Abeta40 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be useful for evaluating Alzheimer disease (AD), but quantification is limited by factors including preanalytical analyte loss. We developed an LC-MS/MS assay that limits analyte loss. Here we describe the analytical characteristics of the assay and its performance in differentiating patients with AD from non-AD dementia and healthy controls. METHODS: To measure Abeta42/Abeta40, we used unique proteolytically derived C-terminal peptides as surrogate markers of Abeta40 and Abeta42, which were analyzed and quantified by LC-MS/MS. The assay was analytically validated and applied to specimens from individuals with clinically diagnosed AD (n = 102), mild cognitive impairment (n = 37), and non-AD dementias (n = 22), as well as from healthy controls (n = 130). Abeta42/Abeta40 values were compared with APOE genotype inferred from phenotype, also measured by LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: The assay had a reportable range of 100 to 25000 pg/mL, a limit of quantification of 100 pg/mL, recoveries between 93% and 111%, and intraassay and interassay CV <15% for both peptides. An Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio cutoff of <0.16 had a clinical sensitivity of 78% for distinguishing patients with AD from non-AD dementia (clinical specificity, 91%) and from healthy controls (clinical specificity, 81%). The Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio decreased significantly (P < 0.001) with increasing dose of APOE4 alleles. CONCLUSIONS: This assay can be used to determine Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios, which correlate with the presence of AD.",

METHODS: Using a prospective observational design, we studied whether long-distance skiers of the Swedish Vasaloppet (n = 197,685) exhibited reduced incidence of VaD or AD compared to matched individuals from the general population (n = 197,684) during 21 years of follow-up (median 10, interquartile range (IQR) 5-15 years). Next, we studied the association between self-reported physical activity, stated twice 5 years apart, and incident VaD and AD in 20,639 participants in the Swedish population-based Malmo Diet and Cancer Study during 18 years of follow-up (median 15, IQR 14-17 years). Finally, we used a mouse model of AD and studied brain levels of amyloid-beta, synaptic proteins, and cognitive function following 6 months of voluntary wheel running. RESULTS: Vasaloppet skiers (median age 36.0 years [IQR 29.0-46.0], 38% women) had lower incidence of all-cause dementia (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.75) and VaD (adjusted HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.33-0.73), but not AD, compared to non-skiers. Further, faster skiers exhibited a reduced incidence of VaD (adjusted HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.16-0.95), but not AD or all-cause dementia compared to slower skiers. In the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study (median age 57.5 years [IQR 51.0-63.8], 60% women), higher physical activity was associated with reduced incidence of VaD (adjusted HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49-0.87), but not AD nor all-cause dementia. These findings were also independent of APOE-epsilon4 genotype. In AD mice, voluntary running did not improve memory, amyloid-beta, or synaptic proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that physical activity in midlife is associated with lower incidence of VaD. Using three different study designs, we found no significant association between physical activity and subsequent development of AD.",

    "abstract": "Modulating the assembly of medically relevant peptides and proteins via macromolecular engineering is an important step in modifying their overall pathological effects. The synthesis of polymer-peptide conjugates composed of the amyloidogenic Alzheimer peptide, Abeta1-40 , and poly(oligo(ethylene glycol)m acrylates) (m = 2,3) with different molecular weights (Mn = 1400-6600 g mol-1 ) is presented here. The challenging conjugation of a synthetic polymer to an in situ aggregating protein is established via two different coupling strategies, only successful for polymers with molecular weights not exceeding 6600 g mol-1 , relying on resin-based synthesis or solution-based coupling chemistries. The conjugates are characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The aggregation of these polymer-Abeta1-40 conjugates, as monitored via thioflavine-T (ThT)-fluorescence spectroscopy, is accelerated mainly upon attaching the polymers. However, the appearance of the observed fibrils is different from those composed of native Abeta1-40, specifically with respect to length and morphology of the obtained aggregates. Instead of long, unbranched fibrils characteristic for Abeta1-40 , bundles of short aggregates are observed for the conjugates. Finally, the ThT kinetics and morphologies of Abeta1-40 fibrils formed in the presence of the conjugates give some mechanistic insights.",

    "abstract": "Fibrillation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is closely associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and so inhibition of Abeta fibrillation has been considered as one of the promising strategies for AD prevention and treatment. Our group has proposed the hydrophobic binding-electrostatic repulsion (HyBER) theory on inhibiting Abeta fibrillation by a surface with mixed negative charges and hydrophobic groups, which provides a new strategy for the design of potent amyloid inhibitors. Carboxyl-terminated polyamidoamine dendrimer (PAMAM) is a kind of biocompatible nanomaterial with only carboxyl groups on its surface, and its architecture and property vary with the generation number, low-generation dendrimers possessing sparse distributions of terminal groups while high-generation dendrimers having compact surface groups, which offer abundant base materials for further study of the HyBER theory. We have designed a potent amyloid inhibitor with generation 5 PAMAM. To provide new insights into the HyBER mechanism, we have herein proposed to synthesize phenyl-modified PAMAM dendrimers of generations 3 to 6 (G3-P to G6-P) and study the effect of the generation number on Abeta fibrillation. Results show that phenyl derivatives of low-generation dendrimers (G3-P and G4-P) do not show any interference with Abeta aggregation, whereas the phenyl derivatives of high-generation dendrimers (G5-P and G6-P) significantly inhibit Abeta42 aggregation and alter the ultrastructure of Abeta42 aggregates. The results indicate that the density and distribution of surface functional groups on a dendrimer is of great importance for the HyBER effect to happen. The new understanding on the HyBER mechanism would benefit in the development of potent amyloid inhibitors based on the theory.",

    "title": "Amyloid-beta-Dependent Inactivation of the Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain at Low Transmembrane Potential: An Ameliorating Process in Hypoxia-Associated Neurodegenerative Disease?",
    "abstract": "Cerebral hypoperfusion-induced hypoxia, a condition that impairs oxygen utilization and thus ATP production by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos), is thought to contribute to neural degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. However, hypoxia upregulates the generation of amyloid-beta (Abeta), a group of peptides known to impair/inhibit the electron transport chain (ETC) of reactions that support oxphos in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). This is a hypothesis paper that reconciles the hypoxia-induced upregulation of Abeta with Abeta's ETC-inhibiting action and, specifically, posits an oxphos-enhancing effect of this inhibition under conditions of newly developing or otherwise mild hypoxia. This effect is typically transient; that is, under conditions of prolonged or severe hypoxia, the oxphos-enhancing activity is overwhelmed by Abeta's well-known toxic actions on mitochondria and other cellular components. The hypothesis is motivated by evidence that the IMM transmembrane potential Psim, an important determinant of ETC activity, exhibits heterogeneity, i.e., a range of values, among a given local population of mitochondria. It specifically proposes that during oxygen limitation, Abeta selectively inactivates ETC complexes in mitochondria that exhibit relatively low absolute values of Psim, thereby suppressing oxygen binding and consumption by complex IV of the ETC in these mitochondria. This effect of Abeta on low-Psim mitochondria is hypothesized to spare hypoxia-limited oxygen for oxphos-enabling utilization by the ETC of the remaining active, higher-Psim local mitochondria, and thereby to increase overall ATP generated collectively by the local mitochondrial population, i.e., to ameliorate hypoxia-induced oxphos reduction. The protective action of Abeta hypothesized here may slow the early development of hypoxia-associated cellular deterioration/loss in Alzheimer's disease and perhaps other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are increasingly being studied as a source of cell therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, and several groups have reported their beneficial effects on Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study using AD model mice (APdE9), we found that transplantation of MSC via the tail vein improved spatial memory in the Morris water maze test. Using electron paramagnetic resonance imaging to evaluate the in vivo redox state of the brain, we found that MSC transplantation suppressed oxidative stress in AD model mice. To elucidate how MSC treatment ameliorates oxidative stress, we focused on amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology and microglial function. MSC transplantation reduced Abeta deposition in the cortex and hippocampus. Transplantation of MSC also decreased Iba1-positive area in the cortex and reduced activated ameboid shaped microglia. On the other hand, MSC transplantation accelerated accumulation of microglia around Abeta deposits and prompted microglial Abeta uptake and clearance as shown by higher frequency of Abeta-containing microglia. MSC transplantation also increased CD14-positive microglia in vivo, which play a critical role in Abeta uptake. To confirm the effects of MSC on microglia, we co-cultured the mouse microglial cell line MG6 with MSC. Co-culture with MSC enhanced Abeta uptake by MG6 cells accompanied by upregulation of CD14 expression. Additionally, co-culture of MG6 cells with MSC induced microglial phenotype switching from M1 to M2 and suppressed production of proinflammatory cytokines. These data indicate that MSC treatment has the potential to ameliorate oxidative stress through modification of microglial functions, thereby improving Abeta pathology in AD model mice.",

    "title": "Dual role of cofilin in APP trafficking and amyloid-beta clearance.",
    "abstract": "The accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plays a pivotal early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the brain, neurons produce Abeta by the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) through the endocytic pathway, whereas microglia mediate Abeta clearance also via endocytic mechanisms. Previous studies have shown the critical importance of cofilin, a filamentous actin-severing protein, in actin dynamics and pathogen-triggered endocytic processes. Moreover, the binding of Abeta42 oligomers to beta1-integrin triggers the cofilin activation, and in turn, cofilin promotes the internalization of surface beta1-integrin. However, a role for cofilin in APP processing and Abeta metabolism has not been investigated. In this study, we found that knockdown of cofilin in Chinese hamster ovary 7WD10 cells and primary neurons significantly reduces Abeta production by increasing surface APP (sAPP) levels. Expression of active (S3A) but not inactive (S3E) cofilin reduces sAPP levels by enhancing APP endocytosis. Accordingly, Abeta deposition in APP and presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic mice is significantly reduced by genetic reduction of cofilin (APP/PS1;cofilin+/-). However, the reduction of Abeta load in APP/PS1;cofilin+/- mice is paradoxically associated with significantly increased ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1-positive microglial activation surrounding Abeta deposits. Primary microglia isolated from cofilin+/- mice demonstrate significantly enhanced state of activation and greater ability to uptake and clear Abeta42, which is reversed with the active (S3A) but not inactive (S3E) form of cofilin. These results taken together indicate a significant role for cofilin in Abeta accumulation via dual and opposing endocytic mechanisms of promoting Abeta production in neurons and inhibiting Abeta clearance in microglia.-Liu, T., Woo, J.-A.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to investigate whether the plasma levels of oligomeric amyloid-beta (OAbeta) were affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to examine the associations (or possible correlations) between plasma OAbeta levels and memory performance. METHOD: Thirty subjects with AD and 28 cognitively normal controls were recruited in the study. The multimer detection system (MDS) was used to measure the levels of OAbeta in the plasma. In addition to assessing the general cognitive function with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive portion (ADAS-Cog), the common objects memory test (COMT) was used to examine the episodic memory performance. Pearson's and partial correlation analyses were conducted to explore the associations between cognitive performance and OAbeta levels in the plasma. A receiving operating curve (ROC) analysis was used to discriminate between the AD and control groups. RESULTS: The plasma OAbeta levels in the AD group were significantly higher than those in the control group [1.88 (0.38) ng/ml vs 1.20 (0.40) ng/ml, p < 0.001]. The elevated levels of plasma OAbeta showed a strong correlation with cognitive performance in patients with AD, including an inverse correlation with scores on the MMSE (r = - 0.43, p = 0.02), CASI (r = - 0.56, p < 0.01), and the immediate recall (r = - 0.45, p = 0.01), 5-min delayed recall (r = - 0.56, p < 0.01), and 30-min delayed recall (r = - 0.71, p < 0.001) tests of the COMT, and a positive correlation with the ADAS-Cog scores (r = 0.59, p < 0.001). The EDTA plasma Abeta oligomer optical density (OD) value measured using the MDS could discriminate between the AD and control groups with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89. The optimal sensitivity and specificity were 82.1% and 90.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The elevated levels of OAbeta in the plasma distinguished the AD and control groups and were associated with the severity of symptoms, especially memory performance, in patients with AD. Our results suggested that plasma OAbeta could potentially be a simple and non-invasive blood-based biomarker for AD diagnosis. Furthermore, longitudinal studies are warranted to explore the application of plasma OAbeta levels as a valid diagnostic biomarker in patients with AD.",

    "title": "Selective Autophagy Receptors in Neuronal Health and Disease.",
    "abstract": "Neurons are electrically excitable, postmitotic cells that perform sensory, relaying, and motor functions. Because of their unique morphological and functional specialization, cells of this type are sensitive to the stress caused by accumulation of misfolded proteins or damaged organelles. Autophagy is the fundamental mechanism that ensures sequestration of cytosolic material and its subsequent degradation in lysosomes of eukaryotic cells, thereby providing cell-autonomous nutrients and removing harmful cargos. Strikingly, mice and flies lacking functional autophagy develop early onset progressive neurodegeneration. Like in human neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs)-Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-characteristic protein aggregates observed in autophagy-deficient neurons in the animal models are indicators of the ongoing neuronal pathology. A number of selective autophagy receptors (SARs) have been characterized that interact both with the cargo and components of the autophagic machinery, thus providing the molecular basis for selective degradation of sizable cytosolic components. Interference with autophagy in experimental models, but also during the pathological vagaries in neurons, will thus have far-reaching consequences for a range of selective autophagy pathways critical for the normal functioning of the nervous system. Here, we review the key principles behind the selective autophagy and discuss how the SARs may be involved in the pathogenesis of NDDs. Using recently published examples, we also examine the emerging role of less well studied selective autophagy pathways in neuronal health and disease. We conclude by discussing targeting selective autophagy as an emerging therapeutic modality in NDDs.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein and has been implicated as a central player in Alzheimer's disease. The N-terminal end of Abeta is variable, and different proportions of these variable-length Abeta peptides are present in healthy individuals and those with the disease. The N-terminally truncated form of Abeta starting at position 4 (Abeta4-x) has a His residue as the third amino acid (His6 using the formal Abeta numbering). The N-terminal sequence Xaa-Xaa-His is known as an amino terminal copper and nickel binding motif (ATCUN), which avidly binds Cu(II). This motif is not present in the commonly studied Abeta1-x peptides. In addition to the ATCUN site, Abeta4-x contains an additional metal binding site located at the tandem His residues (bis-His at His13 and 14) which is also found in other isoforms of Abeta. Using the ATCUN and bis-His motifs, the Abeta4-x peptide is capable of binding multiple metal ions simultaneously. We confirm that Cu(II) bound to this particular ATCUN site is redox silent, but the second Cu(II) site is redox active and can be readily reduced with ascorbate. We have employed surrogate metal ions to block copper coordination at the ATCUN or the tandem His site in order to isolate spectral features of the copper coordination environment for structural characterization using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. This approach reveals that each copper coordination environment is independent in the Cu2Abeta4-x state. The identification of two functionally different copper binding environments within the Abeta4-x sequence may have important implications for this peptide in vivo.",

Surface chirality that shortens the surface residence time of Abeta, for example, R-cysteine modification with carboxylic, secondary amine and thiol groups surrounding the chiral center, can retard Abeta oligomerization and fibrillation. This work is essential to a deeper fundamental understanding of the effects of surface chirality on amyloidosis processes as well as the development of chiral materials to inhibit Abeta fibrillation.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaO) have become representative biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we report on an aptasensor based on stem-loop probes for sensitive and specific detection of AbetaO by an amperometric transducer principle using alternating current voltammetry (ACV). Stem-loop probes with redox-active moieties are immobilized on a gold substrate as a receptor element. The signal transduction mechanism relies on redox ferrocene (Fc) reporting via charge transfer on a molecular recognition event involving a conformational change of the molecular beacon. The stem-loop structures were optimized by considering the aptamers' stem length, spacer, and different ferrocene terminals. In addition, the sensor assembly and signal recording including aptamer concentration and ACV frequency dependence are discussed. Using the optimized stem-loop probe (B-3' Fc), the aptasensor showed a decrease of the Fc peak current induced by AbetaO binding within the broad concentration range spanning 6 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the detection limit of the sensor can be further decreased by optimizing the ACV frequency, however at the cost of a narrowed detection range. In this work, a label-free electrochemical aptasensor is demonstrated, which facilitates the quantification of the concentration of AbetaO with high selectivity and subpicomolar sensitivity, which may be conducive to improving the diagnosis and pharmacology studies of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "The number of patients suffering from dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is constantly rising worldwide. This has accordingly resulted in huge burdens on the health systems and involved families. Lack of profound understanding of neural networking in normal brain and their interruption in AD makes the treatment of this neurodegenerative multifaceted disease a challenging issue. In recent years, mathematical and computational methods have paved the way towards a better understanding of the brain functional connectivity. Thus, much attention has been paid to this matter from both basic science researchers and clinicians with an interdisciplinary approach to determine what is not functioning properly in AD patients and how this malfunctioning can be addressed. In this review, a number of AD-related articles and well-studied pathophysiologic topics (e.g., amyloid-beta, neurofibrillary tangles, Ca2+ dysregulation, and synaptic plasticity alterations) has been literally surveyed from a computational and systems biology point of view. The neural networks were discussed from biological and mathematical point of views and their alterations in recent findings were further highlighted. Application of the graph theoretical analysis in the brain imaging was reviewed, depicting the relations between brain structure and function, without diving into mathematical details. Moreover, differential rate equations were briefly articulated, emphasizing the potential use of these equations in simplifying complex processes in relevance to pathologies of AD. Comprehensive insights were given into the AD progression from neural networks perspective, which may lead us towards potential strategies for early diagnosis and effective treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "The 71-82 fragment of the non-amyloid-beta component (NAC) region of the Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) related protein alpha-Synuclein, has been reported to be important during protein misfolding. Although reports have demonstrated the importance of this fragment for the aggregation properties of the full-length protein, its exact role in pre-fibrillar oligomerisation, fibrillar growth and morphology has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we provide evidence that fibrils prepared from an acetylated and methyl amidated peptide of the NAC 71-82 amino acid stretch of alpha-Synuclein are amyloid and contain, in addition to the cross-beta structure detected in the full-length protein fibrils, a cross-beta structure previously observed in prion proteins. These results shed light on the aggregation propensity of the NAC 71-82 amino acid stretch of the full-length protein but also the roles of the N- and C-terminal domains of alpha-Synuclein in balancing this aggregation propensity. The results also suggest that early aggregated forms of the capped NAC 71-82 peptide generated structures were stabilised by an anti-parallel and twisted beta-sheet motif. Due to its expected toxicity, this beta-sheet motif may be a promising molecular target for the development of therapeutic strategies for PD and DLB.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder, is currently conceptualized as a disease of synaptic failure. Synaptic impairments are robust within the AD brain and better correlate with dementia severity when compared with other pathological features of the disease. Nevertheless, the series of events that promote synaptic failure still remain under debate, as potential triggers such as beta-amyloid (Abeta) can vary in size, configuration and cellular location, challenging data interpretation in causation studies. Here we present data obtained using adeno-associated viral (AAV) constructs that drive the expression of oligomeric Abeta either intra or extracellularly. We observed that expression of Abeta in both cellular compartments affect learning and memory, reduce the number of synapses and the expression of synaptic-related proteins, and disrupt chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP). Together, these findings indicate that during the progression AD the early accumulation of Abeta inside neurons is sufficient to promote morphological and functional cellular toxicity, a phenomenon that can be exacerbated by the buildup of Abeta in the brain parenchyma. Moreover, our AAV constructs represent a valuable tool in the investigation of the pathological properties of Abeta oligomers both in vivo and in vitro.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) have proposed a new Research Framework: Towards a biological definition of Alzheimer's disease, which uses a three-biomarker construct: Ass-amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration AT(N), to generate a biomarker based definition of Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVES: To stratify AIBL participants using the new NIA-AA Research Framework using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. To evaluate the clinical and cognitive profiles of the different groups resultant from the AT(N) stratification. To compare the findings to those that result from stratification using two-biomarker construct criteria (AT and/or A(N)). DESIGN: Individuals were classified as being positive or negative for each of the A, T, and (N) categories and then assigned to the appropriate AT(N) combinatorial group: A-T-(N)-; A+T-(N)-; A+T+(N)-; A+T-(N)+; A+T+(N)+; A-T+(N)-; A-T-(N)+; A-T+(N)+. In line with the NIA-AA research framework, these eight AT(N) groups were then collapsed into four main groups of interest (normal AD biomarkers, AD pathologic change, AD and non-AD pathologic change) and the respective clinical and cognitive trajectories over 4.5 years for each group were assessed. In two sensitivity analyses the methods were replicated after assigning individuals to four groups based on being positive or negative for AT biomarkers as well as A(N) biomarkers. SETTING: Two study centers in Melbourne (Victoria) and Perth (Western Australia), Australia recruited MCI individuals and individuals with AD from primary care physicians or tertiary memory disorder clinics. Cognitively healthy, elderly NCs were recruited through advertisement or via spouses of participants in the study. PARTICIPANTS: One-hundred and forty NC, 33 MCI participants, and 27 participants with AD from the AIBL study who had undergone CSF evaluation using Elecsys  assays. INTERVENTION (if any): Not applicable. MEASUREMENTS: Three CSF biomarkers, namely amyloid beta1-42, phosphorylated tau181, and total tau, were measured to provide the AT(N) classifications. Clinical and cognitive trajectories were evaluated using the AIBL Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (AIBL-PACC), a verbal episodic memory composite, an executive function composite, California Verbal Learning Test - Second Edition; Long-Delay Free Recall, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes scores. RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent of the elderly NCs had no evidence of abnormal AD biomarkers, whereas 33% had biomarker levels consistent with AD or AD pathologic change, and 29% had evidence of non-AD biomarker change. Among NC participants, those with biomarker evidence of AD pathology tended to perform worse on cognitive outcome assessments than other biomarker groups. Approximately three in four participants with MCI or AD had biomarker levels consistent with the research framework's definition of AD or AD pathologic change. For MCI participants, a decrease in AIBL-PACC scores was observed with increasing abnormal biomarkers; and increased abnormal biomarkers were also associated with increased rates of decline across some cognitive measures. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing biomarker abnormality appears to be associated with worse cognitive trajectories. The implementation of biomarker classifications could help better characterize prognosis in clinical practice and identify those at-risk individuals more likely to clinically progress, for their inclusion in future therapeutic trials.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Evidence of accelerated brain aging among HIV-infected adults argues for the increased risk of developing cerebral beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques. We compared the frequency of Abeta plaque-bearing cases in our HIV cohort with that in a general cohort reported by Braak et al. We explored posttranslationally modified Abeta forms (N3pE, E22P, phospho-Ser8) in plaques and E22P-Abeta in the postmortem cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the HIV cohort. DESIGN: Clinicopathological study of HIV-infected adults. METHODS: To assess frontal Abeta plaque deposition, we conducted immunohistochemistry for generic Abeta (4G8) and three modified Abeta forms. We determined CSF E22P-Abeta levels by ELISA. RESULTS: We found 4G8-Abeta plaques in 29% of 279 HIV-infected cases. Within the age range of 31-70 years, the frequency of 4G8-Abeta plaque-bearing cases was higher in our HIV cohort (n = 273) compared with the general cohort (n = 1110) overall (29.3 vs. 25.8%) and across four age groups by decade (odds ratio 2.35, P < 0.0001). In HIV-infected cases with (n = 37) and without (n = 12) 4G8-Abeta plaques, modified Abeta forms occurred in order: N3pE, E22P, and phospho-Ser8. In CSF assays of HIV-infected cases with (n = 27; 17 focal, 10 widespread) and without (n = 11) 4G8-Abeta plaques, the median E22P-Abeta/Abeta40 ratio was higher among cases with widespread plaques than in cases with focal or absent plaques (P = 0.047). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest HIV-infected adults are at increased risk of developing cerebral Abeta plaques. The occurrence of modified Abeta forms in order suggests the progression stages of Abeta plaque deposition. The potential for E22P-Abeta as a CSF biomarker of cerebral Abeta plaques should be investigated.",

    "abstract": "Carrying premature termination codons in 1 allele of the ABCA7 gene is associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the primary function of ABCA7 is to regulate the transport of phospholipids and cholesterol, ABCA7 is also involved in maintaining homeostasis of the immune system. Since inflammatory pathways causatively or consequently participate in AD pathogenesis, we studied the effects of Abca7 haplodeficiency in mice on brain immune responses under acute and chronic conditions. When acute inflammation was induced through peripheral lipopolysaccharide injection in control or heterozygous Abca7 knockout mice, partial ABCA7 deficiency diminished proinflammatory responses by impairing CD14 expression in the brain. On breeding to App NL-G-F knockin mice, we observed increased amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation and abnormal endosomal morphology in microglia. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ABCA7 loss of function may contribute to AD pathogenesis by altering proper microglial responses to acute inflammatory challenges and during the development of amyloid pathology, providing insight into disease mechanisms and possible treatment strategies.",

    "title": "Tracking amyloid oligomerization with monomer resolution using a 13-amino acid peptide with a backbone-fixed spin label.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid oligomers are suspected as toxic agents in neurodegenerative disease, and are transient and often heterogeneous, making them difficult to detect. Here we show an approach to track the development of amyloid oligomers in situ by room temperature, continuous wave (cw) 9 and 95 GHz EPR. Three amyloid peptides with the 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-N-oxyl-4-amino-4-carboxylic acid (TOAC) spin label were synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis: T0EZ (TKVKVLGDVIEVGG) with TOAC (T) at the N-terminus, T5EZ with TOAC in the middle (KVKVTGDVIEVG) and T12EZ with TOAC at the C-terminus (KVKVLGDVIEVTG). These sequences are derived from the K11V (KVKVLGDVIEV) amyloid peptide, which self-aggregates to oligomers with a beta-sheet configuration (A. Laganowsky, et al., Science, 2012, 335, 1228-1231). To monitor oligomerization, the rotational correlation time (taur) is measured by cw-EPR. For the backbone-fixed TOAC label that is devoid of local mobility taur should reflect the rotation and thereby the size of the peptide, resp. oligomer. For T5EZ a good match between the measured taur and the size of the peptide is obtained, showing the validity of the approach. One of the three peptides (T0EZ) aggregates (circular dichroism), whereas the other two do not. Since also the respective MTSL (S-(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-3-yl)methyl methanesulfonothioate) labelled peptides fail to aggregate, molecular crowding due to the label, rather than the helix-inducing properties of TOAC, seems to be responsible. Following in situ oligomer formation of T0EZ by the change in rotational correlation time, two oligomers are observed, a 5-6 mer and a 15-18 mer. The EPR approach, particularly 95 GHz EPR, enables following oligomerization of one monomer at a time, suggesting that the cw-EPR approach presented is a novel tool to follow amyloid oligomerization with high resolution.",

    "title": "Abeta1-42 Oligomers Induced a Short-Term Increase of Glutamate Release Prior to Its Depletion As Measured by Amperometry on Single Varicosities.",
    "abstract": "Glutamate (Glu) is a critical neurotransmitter for neuronal communication in the nervous system. In vivo studies have shown that the concentration of Glu is reduced within the brains of those afflicted with Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is also associated with the accumulation of pathogenic amyloid-beta (Abeta). However, the effects of Abeta peptides on the level of Glu release, as well as how Abeta-mediated Glu fluctuation is initiated, remain largely unknown. Here, we fabricated a Glu electrochemical biosensor and in situ quantitatively monitored the release of Glu from a single varicosity of Abeta1-42-insulted hippocampal neurons. We found that before the depletion of Glu after 300 min of treatment with Abeta1-42, a short-duration (30 min) incubation with Abeta1-42 caused a dramatic increase in vesicular Glu release compared to that of a control. Further investigation demonstrated that the density of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1), which is responsible for transport of Glu into synaptic vesicles, also displayed a significant elevation and then dramatic depletion with the extension of the time of treatment with Abeta1-42. These results indicate that at the early stage of AD, Abeta1-42 induces excessive Glu release, which may overstimulate the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor, resulting in excitotoxicity and damage to neurons. In this work, the amount of Glu released together with its fluctuations under Abeta1-42 oligomers toxicity conditions was monitored for the first time, and such monitoring could provide direct and new insights for current research on Abeta1-42-induced abnormalities in neurotransmitter release and neuron functions.",

    "abstract": "Brain degeneration in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) results from the accumulation of pathological amyloid- (Abeta) plaques and tau protein tangles, leading to altered plasma levels of biomarkers. However, few studies have investigated the association between plasma biomarkers and cognitive impairment in patients with AD. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated correlations between mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores and levels of plasma biomarkers in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and AD. Thirteen individuals with normal cognition, 40 patients with aMCI, and 37 patients with AD were enrolled. Immunomagnetic reduction was used to assess the levels of plasma biomarkers, including amyloid A1-40, A1-42, total tau protein (t-Tau), and phosphorylated tau protein (threonine 181, p-Tau181). Our analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between MMSE and both measures of tau, and a trend toward negative correlation between MMSE and A1-42. In a longitudinal study involving three patients with aMCI and two patients with AD, we observed strong negative correlations (r < -0.8) between changes in MMSE scores and plasma levels of t-Tau. Our results suggest that plasma levels of t-Tau and p-Tau181 can be used to assess the severity of cognitive impairment in patients with AD. Furthermore, the results of our preliminary longitudinal study suggest that levels of t-Tau can be used to monitor the progression of cognitive decline in patients with aMCI/AD.",

    "abstract": "The perceived role of the immune system in neurodegenerative diseases has undergone drastic changes over time. Initially considered as a passive bystander, then condemned as a mediator of neurodegeneration and now established as an important player in the pathogenetic cascade, neuroimmune interactions have come a long way to arrive center stage in Alzheimer's disease research. Despite major breakthroughs in recent years, basic questions remain unanswered as conflicting data describe immune overactivation, inadequate response or exhaustion of the immune system in neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, difficulties in translating in vitro and in vivo studies in model systems to the complex human disease condition with multiple overlapping pathologies and the long disease duration in patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases have hampered progress. Development of novel, advanced model systems, as well as new technologies to interrogate existing disease models and valuable collections of human tissue samples, including brain tissue in parallel with improved imaging and biomarker technologies are guiding the way to better understand the role of the immune system in Alzheimer's disease with hopes for more effective interventions in the future.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers are well-known toxic molecular species associated with Alzheimer's disease. Recent discoveries of the ability of amyloid fibril surfaces to convert soluble proteins into toxic oligomers suggested that these surfaces could serve as therapeutic targets for intervention. We have shown previously that a short helical peptide could be a key structural motif that can specifically recognize the K16-E22 region of the Abeta40 fibril surface with an affinity at the level of several micromolar. Here, we demonstrate that in-tether chiral center-induced helical stabilized peptides could also recognize the fibril surfaces, effectively inhibiting the surface-mediated oligomerization of Abeta40. Moreover, through extensive computational sampling, we observed two distinct ways in which the peptide inhibitors recognize the fibril surface. Apart from a binding mode that, in accord with the original design, involves hydrophobic side chains at the binding interface, we observed much more frequently another binding mode in which the hydrophobic staple interacts directly with the fibril surface. The affinity of the peptides for the fibril surface could be adjusted by tuning the hydrophobicity of the staple. The best candidate investigated here exhibits a submicromolar affinity (~0.75 muM). Collectively, this work opens an avenue for the rational design of candidate drugs with stapled peptides for amyloid-related disease.",

Although recent evidence implicates that amyloid deposition in vivo is highly related to biomembranes, how the characteristic lipid components of neuronal membranes mediate this process remains to be fully elucidated. Herein, we established vesicle models to mimic exosomes and investigated their influence on the kinetics of Abeta(1-42) amyloidosis. By using ternary vesicles composed of three brain lipids monosialoganglioside GM1, cholesterol and sphingomyelin, we found that GM1 could regulate peptide fibrillation by facilitating the conformational transition of Abeta(1-42), and further quantitatively analyzed the influence of GM1-containing vesicles on the kinetics of Abeta(1-42) fibrillation. In addition, GM1-containing vesicles induced the formation of Abeta(1-42) fibrils at low concentrations, and these fibrils were toxic to PC12 cells. By analyzing the role of GM1 in this ternary mixture of membranes at the molecular level, we confirmed that GM1 clusters are presented as attachment sites for peptides, thus promoting the fibrillation of Abeta(1-42).",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exploring the relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers and subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is needed for better defining its clinical meaning in preclinical AD (preAD). OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between the Subjective Cognitive Decline Questionnaire (SCD-Q), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta (Abeta). METHODS: 56 cognitively healthy older adults and their informants answered the SCD-Q. Correlations between GM and SCD-Q scores were explored using structural voxel-based morphometry models including Abeta levels. SCD-Q*Abeta vectors were calculated with higher scores reflecting higher SCD and cerebral amyloid, simultaneously. Subjects were classified according to their perception of cognitive worsening in the last two years, exploring for GM differences between-groups. RESULTS: Higher self-reported SCD-Q scores correlated with reduced GM in the right frontal lobe and increased volumes in the occipital lobe, calcarine sulcus, fusiform gyrus, and cerebellum, while higher informant's scores correlated with increased GM in the right middle temporal gyrus. Correlations were more significant for SCD-Q language items, self-complaints, and more positive than negative correlations were found. The SCD-Q*Abeta vectors were negatively associated with GM both in self and informant's reports. Finally, lower Abeta levels related to lower GM in subjects who noticed cognitive worsening, but related to higher GM in subjects who have not noticed this decline. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SCD-Q scores relate with incipient brain changes that may be due to preAD. Independent studies are needed to confirm our observations.",

BiOI was attached to the surface of TiO2 and formed a heterogeneous structure (p-n junction), which enlarged the light harvest range and enhanced the electron transfer rate of TiO2. In order to quench the PEC signal, PbS-Au heterodimers were used as the labels to combine with Abeta. Owing to the competitively light energy harvesting and electron donor consuming effect of PbS-Au heterodimers, less light energy and electron donor arrived at TiO2/BiOI. In addition, Au directly contacted with PbS could enhance the electron seperation and transfer rate, and lead to improved competitiveness consumption of the electron donor. PbS-Au integrated with secondary antibodies formed PbS-Au-Ab2 bioconjugate, which would further obstruct the electron transfer and impede the interreaction between electron donor and photoelectrode surfaces. Owing to the unique PbS-Au heterodimer structure and the quenching effect of PbS-Au-Ab2 bioconjugate, the fabricated immunosensor for Abeta detection exhibited good stability, high sensitivity, and a low detection limit of 0.028 pg/mL (S/N = 3).",

A central domain of beta-amyloid (Abeta21-30) has been proposed to have intrinsic structural propensities that guide the limited formation of structure in the process of fibrillization. In order to test this hypothesis, we examine several internal fragments of Abeta, and variants of these either cyclized or with an N-terminal Cys. While Abeta21-30 and variants were always monomeric and unstructured (circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMRS)), we found that the addition of flanking hydrophobic residues in Abeta16-34 led to formation of typical amyloid fibrils. NMR showed no long-range nuclear overhauser effect (nOes) in Abeta21-30, Abeta16-34, or their variants, however. Serial 1 H-15 N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy, 1 H-1 H nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy, and 1 H-1 H total correlational spectroscopy spectra were used to follow aggregation of Abeta16-34 and Cys-Abeta16-34 at a site-specific level. The addition of an N-terminal Cys residue (in Cys-Abeta16-34) increased the rate of fibrillization which was attributable to disulfide bond formation. We propose a scheme comparing the aggregation pathways for Abeta16-34 and Cys-Abeta16-34, according to which Cys-Abeta16-34 dimerizes, which accelerates fibril formation. In this context, cysteine residues form a focal point that guides fibrillization, a role which, in native peptides, can be assumed by heterogeneous nucleators of aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Propose: To investigate whether miR-22-3p is able to regulate AD development and its molecular mechanism. METHODS: Morris water maze test was performed to test the spatial memory. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to assess the expression level of miR-22-3p. The enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to assess the levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42. Immunoblotting analysis was performed to detect the protein expression levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14) and beta-site Amyloid precursor protein Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1). Luciferase assay was used to identify the interaction between miR- 22-3p and MAPK14. The tetrazolium dye (MTT) colorimetric assay was used to test the influence of miR-22-3p overexpression on cell viability. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of miR-22-3p overexpression on cell apoptosis. RESULTS: Morris water maze test showed that mice model of AD had impaired spatial memory, which was able to be ameliorated by miR-22-3p overexpression. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that the protein expression levels of APP, MAPK14 and BACE1 were enhanced in AD model, which could be prevented by miR-22-3p overexpression. ELISA showed that Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels were dramatically increased in AD model, which were inhibited by miR-22-3p overexpression. Luciferase assay and immunoblotting analysis indicated that miR-22-3p targeted and regulated MAPK14 expression. CONCLUSION: MiR-22-3p overexpression reduced Abeta deposit and alleviated AD symptoms by targeting and regulating MAPK14 expression, which ameliorated AD symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is connected to aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and formation of insoluble plaques in the brain. Abeta level can be monitored as an AD early diagnosis route. In this study, an irregular shaped microporous gold nanostructure with a typical size of 150 x 250 nm was electrodeposited on a polycrystalline gold surface at 0 mV (vs. AgCl) using sodium alendronate. The nanostructure was then characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy. An electrochemical peptide-based biosensor was fabricated by immobilizing an Abeta(1-42)-binding peptide on the gold nanostructure. Binding of Abeta(1-42) by the peptide was followed electrochemically using ferro/ferricyanide as a redox probe. Differential pulse voltammograms in a potential range of 0-500 mV (vs. AgCl) with typical peak potentials at 224 mV are linear in the 3-7000 pg mL-1 Abeta(1-42) concentration range, with a 0.2 pg mL-1 detection limit. The biosensor is free of interferences and was applied to the quantitation of Abeta(1-42) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid and spiked serum samples.

Volume-per-length analysis confirms that they are composed of discrete cross-beta filaments, and the analysis of HR-AFM images yields the number of striations in each fibril.

It also measured the extent to which age-related differences in cognition are driven by measurable brain pathology. All participants underwent neuropsychological assessment along with magnetic resonance imaging and Pittsburg compound B-positron emission tomography imaging for Abeta quantification. WMH severity was quantified using the age-related white matter changes scale. Stepwise regressions, moderation, and mediation modeling were performed. Our findings show that Abeta deposition single-handedly predicts poorer episodic memory performance and that Abeta and WMHs contribute additively to poorer performance in working memory and language while carrying synergistic associations with executive functions and attention. Through mediation modeling, we demonstrated that the influence of age over episodic memory, working memory, executive functions, and language is fully mediated by brain pathology. This study permits to conclude that, in healthy older adults, (1) Abeta burden and WMHs have synergistic associations with some cognitive domains and (2) age-related differences in most cognitive domains are driven by brain pathology associated with dementia.",

Binding of the same peptide to the pure DMPC bilayer served as a control. Due to significant C-terminal hydrophobic moment, binding to the ternary and DMPC bilayers promotes helical structure in the peptide. For both bilayers a polarized binding profile is observed, in which the N-terminus anchors to the bilayer surface, whereas the C-terminus alternates between unbound and inserted states. Both ternary and DMPC bilayers feature two Abeta25-35 bound states, surface bound, S, and inserted, I, separated by modest free energy barriers. Experimental data are in agreement with our results but indicate that cholesterol impact is Abeta fragment dependent. For Abeta25-35, we predict that its binding mechanism is independent of the inclusion of PSM and cholesterol into the bilayer.",

The purpose of the present studies was to extend this work by determining whether a social stressor, isolation stress, would increase the number of Abeta plaques in 5xFAD + transgenic mice in comparison to group-housed controls, and accelerate the onset of cognitive deficits in contextual fear-conditioning. Additionally, we aimed to determine whether the pathological impact of isolation stress could be prevented through exposure to exercise alone or to exercise and an enriched environment throughout the isolation period. Two-month-old 5xFAD + and 5xFAD- animals were isolated or group-housed for two and three months. An additional subset of 5xFAD + mice were housed in isolation, housed in isolation with an exercise wheel, or housed in isolation with an exercise wheel and an enriched environment. Both two and three months of isolation stress significantly increased the number of plaques in the hippocampus of 5xFAD + mice, and three months of isolation increased hippocampal BACE1 expression. Isolated animals also displayed a significant cognitive deficit in contextual fear-conditioning, independent of genotype. Furthermore, neither exercise nor an enriched environment were able to prevent these isolation-induced effects. Understanding how stress impacts the onset and progression of AD is critical, as many individuals endure significant stress over their lifespan, including prolonged social isolation, a societal trend likely to worsen with time.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has several hallmark features including amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque deposits and neuronal loss. Here, we characterized Abeta plaque aggregation and parvalbumin-positive (PV) GABAergic neurons in 6-9-month-old 5xFAD mice harboring mutations associated with familial AD. We used immunofluorescence staining to compare three regions in the frontal cortex-prelimbic (PrL), cingulate (Cg, including Cg1 and Cg2), and secondary motor (M2) cortices-along with primary somatosensory (S1) cortex. We quantified the density of Abeta plaques, which showed significant laminar and regional vulnerability. There were more plaques of larger sizes in deep layers compared to superficial layers. Total plaque burden was higher in frontal regions compared to S1. We also found layer- and region-specific differences across genotype in the density of PV interneurons. PV neuron density was lower in 5xFAD mice than wild-type, particularly in deep layers of frontal regions, with Cg (-50%) and M2 (-39%) exhibiting the largest reduction. Using in vivo two-photon imaging, we longitudinally visualized the loss of frontal cortical PV neurons across four weeks in the AD mouse model. Overall, these results provide information about Abeta deposits and PV neuron density in a widely used mouse model for AD, implicating deep layers of frontal cortical regions as being especially vulnerable.",

    "abstract": "The aging brain with mitochondrial dysfunction and a reduced adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) has been implicated in the onset and progression of beta-Amyloid (Abeta)-induced neuronal toxicity in AD. To unravel the function of ATP and the underlying mechanisms on AD development, APP/PS1 double transgenic mice and wild-type (WT) C57 mice at 6 and 10 months of age were studied. We demonstrated a decreased ATP release in the hippocampus and platelet of APP/PS1 mice, comparing to C57 mice at a relatively early age. Levels of Abeta were raised in both hippocampus and platelet of APP/PS1 mice, accompanied by a decrease of alpha-secretase activity and an increase of beta-secretase activity. Moreover, our results presented an age-dependent rise in mitochondrial vulnerability to oxidation in APP/PS1 mice. In addition, we found decreased pSer473-Akt levels, increased GSK3beta activity by inhibiting phosphorylation at Ser9 in aged APP/PS1 mice and these dysfunctions probably due to down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3. Therefore, we demonstrate that PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta signaling pathway could be involved in Abeta-associated mitochondrial dysfunction of APP/PS1 mice and APP abnormal metabolism in platelet might provide potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of AD.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that the inhibition of neuroinflammation is a potential target for therapeutic or preventive strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Chemerin has attracted particular attention for its role in the regulation of inflammation. In addition, amyloid beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) can interact with chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1), the receptor for chemerin, and induce microglial chemotaxis. Meanwhile, CMKLR1 is expressed in the brain, and both chemerin and Abeta1-42 share the same receptor. Thus, we hypothesized that chemerin (C9), a chemerin-derived nonapeptide, may have the potential to ameliorate Abeta1-42 mediated AD disease progression. The results showed that an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of C9 (8 microg/kg) facilitated memory formation and improved memory retention, as evidenced by the results of both the novel object recognition test (NOR) and object location recognition (OLR) tasks. These memory-enhancing effects of C9 were also observed after C9 (2 microg/kg) was infused into the hippocampus. Moreover, we found that treatment with C9 reversed the deficits in memory and learning ability induced by oligomeric Abeta1-42. Meanwhile, C9 also significantly inhibited Abeta1-42-induced increases in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the hippocampus. The same results were obtained for Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments. Finally, we observed that C9 did not affect locomotor activity, suggesting that its improvement of memory is not a false positive induced by hypolocomotion. In conclusion, C9 may facilitate memory formation, prolong memory retention, and ameliorate Abeta1-42-induced memory impairment, suggesting that C9 may potentially represent a novel strategy for the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Unawareness, or anosognosia, of memory deficits is a challenging manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that adversely affects a patient's safety and decision-making. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the presence, as well as the evolution, of altered awareness of memory function across the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD. Here, we aimed to characterize change in awareness of memory abilities and its relationship to beta-amyloid (Abeta) burden in a large cohort (N = 1,070) of individuals across the disease spectrum. METHODS: Memory awareness was longitudinally assessed (average number of visits = 4.3) and operationalized using the discrepancy between mean participant and partner report on the Everyday Cognition scale (memory domain). Abeta deposition was measured at baseline using [18F]florbetapir positron emission tomographic imaging. RESULTS: Abeta predicted longitudinal changes in memory awareness, such that awareness decreased faster in participants with increased Abeta burden. Abeta and clinical group interacted to predict change in memory awareness, demonstrating the strongest effect in dementia participants, but could also be found in the cognitively normal (CN) participants. In a subset of CN participants who progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), heightened memory awareness was observed up to 1.6 years before MCI diagnosis, with memory awareness declining until the time of progression to MCI (-0.08 discrepant-points/yr). In a subset of MCI participants who progressed to dementia, awareness was low initially and continued to decline (-0.23 discrepant-points/yr), reaching anosognosia 3.2 years before dementia onset. INTERPRETATION: Abeta burden is associated with a progressive decrease in self-awareness of memory deficits, reaching anosognosia approximately 3 years before dementia diagnosis.

However, there is currently no AD model mouse in which to specifically analyze the function of Abeta oligomers only. We have now developed a novel AD model mouse, an Abeta-GFP transgenic mouse (Abeta-GFP Tg), that expresses the GFP-fused human Abeta1-42 protein, which forms only Abeta oligomers within neurons throughout their life. The fusion proteins are expressed mainly in the hippocampal CA1-CA2 region and cerebral cortex, and are not secreted extracellularly. The Abeta-GFP Tg mice exhibit increased tau phosphorylation, altered spine morphology, decreased expressions of the GluN2B receptor and neuroligin in synaptic regions, attenuated hippocampal long-term potentiation, and impaired object recognition memory compared with non-Tg littermates. Interestingly, these dysfunctions have already appeared in 2-3-months-old animals. The Abeta-GFP fusion protein is bioactive and highly toxic, and induces the similar synaptic dysfunctions as the naturally generated Abeta oligomer derived from postmortem AD patient brains and synthetic Abeta oligomers. Thus, Abeta-GFP Tg mouse is a new tool specialized to analyze the function of Abeta oligomers in vivo and to find subtle changes in synapses in early symptoms of AD.",

Despite the observed co-pathology and concomitance of motor and cognitive phenotypes, the consequences of the primary amyloidogenic protein on the secondary pathologies remain poorly understood. To better define the relationship between alpha-syn and Abeta plaques, we injected alpha-syn preformed fibrils (alpha-syn mpffs) into mice with abundant Abeta plaques. Abeta deposits dramatically accelerated alpha-syn pathogenesis and spread throughout the brain. Remarkably, hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) was induced in alpha-syn mpff-injected 5xFAD mice. Finally, alpha-syn mpff-injected 5xFAD mice showed neuron loss that correlated with the progressive decline of cognitive and motor performance. Our findings suggest a \"feed-forward\" mechanism whereby Abeta plaques enhance endogenous alpha-syn seeding and spreading over time post-injection with mpffs.",

    "abstract": "The three GxxxG repeating motifs from the C-terminal region of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide play a significant role in regulating the aggregation kinetics of the peptide. Mutation of these glycine residues to leucine greatly accelerates the fibrillation process but generates a varied toxicity profile. Using an array of biophysical techniques, we demonstrated the uniqueness of the composite glycine residues in these structural repeats. We used solvent relaxation NMR spectroscopy to investigate the role played by the surrounding water molecules in determining the corresponding aggregation pathway. Notably, the conformational changes induced by Gly33 and Gly37 mutations result in significantly decreased toxicity in a neuronal cell line. Our results indicate that G33 xxxG37 is the primary motif responsible for Abeta neurotoxicity, hence providing a direct structure-function correlation. Targeting this motif, therefore, can be a promising strategy to prevent neuronal cell death associated with Alzheimer's and other related diseases, such as type II diabetes and Parkinson's.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation is generally believed as the crucial and primary cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, current Abeta-targeted therapeutic strategies show limited disease-modifying efficacy due to the irreversible damages in the late stage of AD, thus the treatment should be given before the formation of deposition and target primary Abeta species rather than advanced plaques. Herein, inspired by heat shock protein, a self-assembly nanochaperone based on mixed-shell polymeric micelle (MSPM) is devised to act as a novel strategy for AD prevention. With unique surface hydrophobic domains, this nanochaperone can selectively capture Abeta peptides, effectively suppress Abeta aggregation, and remarkably reduce Abeta-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover, the formed nanochaperone-Abeta complex after Abeta adsorption can be easily phagocytosed by microglia and thereby facilitates Abeta clearance. As a result, the nanochaperone reduces Abeta burden, attenuates Abeta-induced inflammation, and eventually rescues the cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice. These results indicate that this biomimetic nanochaperone can successfully prevent the onset of AD symptoms and serve as a promising candidate for prophylactic treatment of AD.",

Here we applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing to entorhinal cortex samples from control and Alzheimer's disease brains (n = 6 per group), yielding a total of 13,214 high-quality nuclei. We detail cell-type-specific gene expression patterns, unveiling how transcriptional changes in specific cell subpopulations are associated with Alzheimer's disease. We report that the Alzheimer's disease risk gene APOE is specifically repressed in Alzheimer's disease oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and astrocyte subpopulations and upregulated in an Alzheimer's disease-specific microglial subopulation. Integrating transcription factor regulatory modules with Alzheimer's disease risk loci revealed drivers of cell-type-specific state transitions towards Alzheimer's disease. For example, transcription factor EB, a master regulator of lysosomal function, regulates multiple disease genes in a specific Alzheimer's disease astrocyte subpopulation. These results provide insights into the coordinated control of Alzheimer's disease risk genes and their cell-type-specific contribution to disease susceptibility.

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence highlights the central role of neurotoxic oligomers of the 42-residue-long beta-amyloid (Abeta42) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, very limited information is available on the structural transition from oligomer to fibril, particularly for pathologically relevant amyloids. To the best of our knowledge, we present here the first site-specific structural characterization of Abeta42 misfolding, from toxic oligomeric assembly yielding a similar conformation to an AD-associated Abeta42 oligomer, into a fibril. Transmission EM (TEM) analysis revealed that a spherical amyloid assembly (SPA) of Abeta42 with a 15.6 +- 2.1-nm diameter forms in a ~30-mum Abeta42 solution after a ~10-h incubation at 4  C, followed by a slow conversion into fibril at ~180 h. Immunological analysis suggested that the SPA has a surface structure similar to that of amylospheroid (ASPD), a patient-derived toxic Abeta oligomer, which had a diameter of 10-15 nm in negative-stain TEM. Solid-state NMR analyses indicated that the SPA structure involves a beta-loop-beta motif, which significantly differed from the triple-beta motif observed for the Abeta42 fibril. The comparison of the 13C chemical shifts of SPA with those of the fibril prepared in the above conditions and interstrand distance measurements suggested a large conformational change involving rearrangements of intermolecular beta-sheet into in-register parallel beta-sheet during the misfolding. A comparison of the SPA and ASPD 13C chemical shifts indicated that SPA is structurally similar to the ASPD relevant to AD. These observations provide insights into the architecture and key structural transitions of amyloid oligomers relevant for AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "The global epidemic of Alzheimer disease (AD) is worsening, and no approved treatment can revert or arrest progression of this disease. AD pathology is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Genetic data, as well as autopsy and neuroimaging studies in patients with AD, indicate that Abeta plaque deposition precedes cortical tau pathology. Because Abeta accumulation has been considered the initial insult that drives both the accumulation of tau pathology and tau-mediated neurodegeneration in AD, the development of AD therapeutics has focused mostly on removing Abeta from the brain. However, striking preclinical evidence from AD mouse models and patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cell models indicates that tau pathology can progress independently of Abeta accumulation and arises downstream of genetic risk factors for AD and aberrant metabolic pathways. This Review outlines novel insights from preclinical research that implicate apolipoprotein E, the endocytic system, cholesterol metabolism and microglial activation as Abeta-independent regulators of tau pathology. These factors are discussed in the context of emerging findings from clinical pathology, functional neuroimaging and other approaches in humans. Finally, we discuss the implications of these new insights for current Abeta-targeted strategies and highlight the emergence of novel therapeutic strategies that target processes upstream of both Abeta and tau.",

Herein, we intended to improve the efficiency and selectivity of traditional chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) combined with a fluorescent group 4-aminosalicylic acid (4-ASA)to acquire a novel potential chelator 4,4'-((2,2'-(ethane-1,2-diylbis((carboxymethyl)azanediyl))bis(acetyl))bis(azanediyl))bis(2-hydroxybenzoic acid) (EDTA-ASA) capable of disaggregating Abeta-Cu(II)/ Zn(II) aggregates. EDTA-ASA combines 4-ASA as fluorophore and multidentate amino nitrogen, hydroxyl and carboxyl groups to chelate Cu2+ from Abeta-Cu (II) aggregates. The specific selectivity of EDTA-ASA towards Cu2+ in Tris-HCl buffer solution was investigated by fluorescence measurements. It exhibits high recognition towards Cu2+ with no significant interference of other competitive metal ions, which overcomes the deficiencies of EDTA. Importantly, the binding sites and binding mode for Cu2+ were clarified through DFT calculations. The thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence analyses and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results have revealed EDTA-ASA exhibited an enhanced disaggregation capability on Abeta-Cu (II)/Zn (II) aggregates in comparison to EDTA. The Cu2+ chelating affinity was sufficient for EDTA-ASA to sequester Cu2+ from Abeta-Cu (II) aggregates.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain is proposed as a cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with Abeta oligomers hypothesized to be the primary mediators of neurotoxicity. Crenezumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody that has been shown to bind to synthetic monomeric and aggregated Abeta in vitro; however, less is known about the binding characteristic in vivo. In this study, we evaluated the binding patterns of crenezumab to synthetic and native forms of Abeta both in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Crenezumab was used to immunoprecipitate Abeta from synthetic Abeta preparations or brain homogenates from a PS2APP mouse model of AD to determine the forms of Abeta that crenezumab interacts with. Following systemic dosing in PS2APP or nontransgenic control mice, immunohistochemistry was used to localize crenezumab and assess its relative distribution in the brain, compared with amyloid plaques and markers of neuritic dystrophies (BACE1; LAMP1). Pharmacodynamic correlations were performed to investigate the relationship between peripheral and central target engagement. RESULTS: In vitro, crenezumab immunoprecipitated Abeta oligomers from both synthetic Abeta preparations and endogenous brain homogenates from PS2APP mice. In vivo studies in the PS2APP mouse showed that crenezumab localizes to regions surrounding the periphery of amyloid plaques in addition to the hippocampal mossy fibers. These regions around the plaques are reported to be enriched in oligomeric Abeta, actively incorporate soluble Abeta, and contribute to Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and axonal dystrophy. In addition, crenezumab did not appear to bind to the dense core region of plaques or vascular amyloid. CONCLUSIONS: Crenezumab binds to multiple forms of amyloid beta (Abeta), particularly oligomeric forms, and localizes to brain areas rich in Abeta oligomers, including the halo around plaques and hippocampal mossy fibers, but not to vascular Abeta. These insights highlight a unique mechanism of action for crenezumab of engaging Abeta oligomers.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is characterized by the aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau in the form of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. It has been found that a synergistic relationship between these two proteins may contribute to their roles in disease progression. However, how Abeta and tau interact has not been fully characterized. Here, we analyze how tau seeding or aggregation is influenced by different Abeta self-assemblies (fibrils and oligomers). Our cellular assays utilizing tau biosensor cells show that transduction of Abeta oligomers into the cells greatly enhances seeded tau aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, transduced Abeta fibrils slightly reduce tau seeding while untransduced Abeta fibrils promote it. We also observe that the transduction of alpha-synuclein fibrils, another amyloid protein, has no effect on tau seeding. The enhancement of tau seeding by Abeta oligomers was confirmed using tau fibril seeds derived from both recombinant tau and PS19 mouse brain extracts containing human tau. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the specific form and cellular location of Abeta self-assembly when studying the relationship between Abeta and tau in future AD therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "Deposition of amyloid protein, particularly Abeta1-42 , is a major contributor to the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, almost no deposition of Abeta in the peripheral tissues could be found. Human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant protein in the blood, has been reported to inhibit amyloid formation through binding Abeta, which is believed to play an important role in the peripheral clearance of Abeta. We identified the Abeta binding site on HSA and developed HSA mutants with high binding capacities for Abeta using a phage display method. HSA fragment 187-385 (Domain II) was found to exhibit the highest binding capacity for Abeta compared with the other two HSA fragments. To elucidate the sequence that forms the binding site for Abeta on Domain II, a random screening of Domain II display phage biopanning was constructed. A number of mutants with higher Abeta binding capacities than the wild type were identified. These mutants exhibited stronger scavenging abilities than the wild type, as revealed via in vitro equilibrium dialysis of Abeta experiments. These findings provide useful basic data for developing a safer alternative therapy than Abeta vaccines and for application in plasma exchange as well as extracorporeal dialysis.",

    "abstract": "Proteasome malfunction parallels abnormal amyloid accumulation in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Here we scrutinize a small library of pyrazolones by assaying their ability to enhance proteasome activity and protect neuronal cells from amyloid toxicity. Tube tests evidenced that aminopyrine and nifenazone behave as 20S proteasome activators. Enzyme assays carried out on an \"open gate\" mutant (alpha3DeltaN) proteasome demonstrated that aminopyrine activates proteasome through binding the alpha-ring surfaces and influencing gating dynamics. Docking studies coupled with STD-NMR experiments showed that H-bonds and pi-pi stacking interactions between pyrazolones and the enzyme play a key role in bridging alpha1 to alpha2 and, alternatively, alpha5 to alpha6 subunits of the outer alpha-ring. Aminopyrine and nifenazone exhibit neurotrophic properties and protect differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells from beta-amyloid (Abeta) toxicity. ESI-MS studies confirmed that aminopyrine enhances Abeta degradation by proteasome in a dose-dependent manner. Our results suggest that some pyrazolones and, in particular, aminopyrine are promising compounds for the development of proteasome activators for AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Dementia frequently occurs in Down syndrome (DS) patients, and early intervention is important in its management. We have previously demonstrated a positive correlation of plasma beta-amyloid Abeta42 levels and negative correlations of Abeta40 and tau levels with dementia in DS. In this study, we examined more cases and constructed composite scores with both tau and amyloids to correlate with dementia in DS. Plasma Abeta42, Abeta40, and tau proteins were measured by an immunomagnetic reduction assay in DS patients. Data were randomly and repeatedly split into training and validating sets, and logistic regression was applied to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) for each biomarker. A total of 73 DS patients (among them, 23 had neurodegeneration) and 77 controls were recruited. In DS patients without dementia, plasma Abeta40 and tau levels were highly elevated, but Abeta42 levels were lower than those of the healthy controls. DS patients with dementia, compared with DS patients with no dementia, had a large decline in Abeta40 and tau but a rise in Abeta42. For biomarker scores correlating with dementia, Abeta40 revealed an AUC of 0.912; the composite score of Abeta40 x tau revealed an AUC of 0.953; and a combined composite score of 0.1 for Abeta40 x Tau +0.9 Tau x Abeta40/Abeta42 achieved the highest AUC of 0.965. Therefore, composite biomarker scores including both plasma tau and beta-amyloid levels correlate with dementia in DS better than using individual biomarker scores. The pattern of tau decline and Abeta42 rise in DS patients with dementia are also different from previous findings in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "PET and CSF amyloid-beta status are differently predicted by patient features: information from discordant cases.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta PET and CSF Abeta42 yield discordant results in 10-20% of memory clinic patients, possibly providing unique information. Although the predictive power of demographic, clinical, genetic, and imaging features for amyloid positivity has previously been investigated, it is unknown whether these features differentially predict amyloid-beta status based on PET or CSF or whether this differs by disease stage. METHODS: We included 768 patients (subjective cognitive decline (SCD, n = 194), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 127), dementia (AD and non-AD, n = 447) with amyloid-beta PET and CSF Abeta42 measurement within 1 year. Ninety-seven (13%) patients had discordant PET/CSF amyloid-beta status. We performed parallel random forest models predicting separately PET and CSF status using 17 patient features (demographics, APOE4 positivity, CSF (p)tau, cognitive performance, and MRI visual ratings) in the total patient group and stratified by syndrome diagnosis. Thereafter, we selected features with the highest variable importance measure (VIM) as input for logistic regression models, where amyloid status on either PET or CSF was predicted by (i) the selected patient feature and (ii) the patient feature adjusted for the status of the other amyloid modality. RESULTS: APOE4, CSF tau, and p-tau had the highest VIM for PET and CSF in all groups. In the amyloid-adjusted logistic regression models, p-tau was a significant predictor for PET-amyloid in SCD (OR = 1.02 [1.01-1.04], pFDR = 0.03), MCI (OR = 1.05 [1.02-1.07], pFDR < 0.01), and dementia (OR = 1.04 [1.03-1.05], pFDR < 0.001), but not for CSF-amyloid. APOE4 (OR = 3.07 [1.33-7.07], punc < 0.01) was associated with CSF-amyloid in SCD, while it was only predictive for PET-amyloid in MCI (OR = 9.44 [2.93, 30.39], pFDR < 0.01). Worse MMSE scores (OR = 1.21 [1.03-1.41], punc = 0.02) were associated to CSF-amyloid status in SCD, whereas worse memory (OR = 1.17 [1.05-1.31], pFDR = 0.02) only predicted PET positivity in dementia. CONCLUSION: Amyloid status based on either PET or CSF was predicted by different patient features, and this varied by disease stage, suggesting that PET-CSF discordance yields unique information. The stronger associations of both APOE4 carriership and worse memory z-scores with CSF-amyloid in SCD suggest that CSF-amyloid is more sensitive early in the disease course. The higher predictive value of CSF p-tau for a positive PET scan suggests that PET is more specific to AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "The oligomerization of Abeta16-22 peptide, which is the hydrophobic core region of full-length Abeta1-42, causes Alzheimer's disease (AD). This progressive neurodegenerative disease affects over 44 million people worldwide. However, very few synthesized drug molecules are available to inhibit the aggregation of Abeta. Recently, experimental studies have shown that the biological ATP molecule prevents Abeta fibrillation at the millimolar scale; however, the significance of ATP molecules on Abeta fibrillation and the mechanism behind it remain elusive. We have carried out a total of 7.5 mus extensive all-atom molecular dynamics and 8.82 mus of umbrella sampling in explicit water using AMBER14SB, AMBER99SB-ILDN, and AMBER-FB15 force fields for Abeta16-22 peptide, to investigate the role of ATP on the disruption of Abeta16-22 prefibrils. From various analyses, such as secondary structure analysis, residue-wise contact map, SASA, and interaction energies, we have observed that, in the presence of ATP, the aggregation of Abeta16-22 peptide is very unfavorable. Moreover, the biological molecule ATP interacts with the Abeta16-22 peptide via hydrogen bonding, pi-pi stacking, and NH-pi interactions which, ultimately, prevent the aggregation of Abeta16-22 peptide. Hence, we assume that the deficiency of ATP may cause Alzheimer's disease (AD).",

    "title": "HHV-6A infection induces amyloid-beta expression and activation of microglial cells.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The control of viral infections in the brain involves the activation of microglial cells, the macrophages of the brain that are constantly surveying the central nervous system, and the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) as an anti-microbial molecule. Recent findings suggest a possible implication of HHV-6A in AD. We evaluated the effect of HHV-6A infection on microglial cell expression Abeta and the activation status, determined by TREM2, ApoE, cytokines, and tau expression. METHODS: We have infected microglial cells (HMC3, ATCC CRL-3304), in monolayer and human peripheral blood monocyte-derived microglia (PBM-microglia) spheroid 3D model, with HHV-6A (strain U1102) cell-free virus inocula with 100 genome equivalents per 1 cell. We collected the cells 1, 3, 7, and 14 days post-infection (d.p.i.) and analyzed them for viral DNA and RNA, ApoE, Abeta (1-40, 1-42), tau, and phospho-tau (Threonine 181) by real-time immunofluorescence and cytokines by immunoenzymatic assay. RESULTS: We observed a productive infection by HHV-6A. The expression of Abeta 1-42 increased from 3 d.p.i., while no significant induction was observed for Abeta 1-40. The HHV-6A infection induced the activation (TREM2, IL-1beta, ApoE) and migration of microglial cells. The secretion of tau started from 7 d.p.i., with an increasing percentage of the phosphorylated form. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, microglial cells are permissive to HHV-6A infection that induces the expression of Abeta and an activation status. Meanwhile, we hypothesize a paracrine effect of HHV-6A infection that activates and induces microglia migration to the site of infection.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of proteins in the brain is one of the main features of neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer's disease, the abnormal aggregation of Abeta-42 is due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The latter is due to variations in the environment, such as temperature, salt concentration, and pH. We evaluated the effect of protonation/deprotonation of residues that are part of trimeric and pentameric oligomers at pH 5, pH 6, and pH 7. Molecular dynamics simulation at 200 ns in the canonical ensemble was implemented. The results have revealed that histidine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid residues showed a protonation/deprotonation effect in oligomers. The root mean square deviation analysis was used to analyze the structural stability at different pHs. We found an increase in hydrophobicity in the side chains of the trimer, while in the pentamer, the structural instability of a compact structure at pH 5 caused the hydrophobic core to open, revealing the hydrophobic region to the environment. At this point, we believe that conformational changes mediated by pH are essential in the aggregation of Abeta-42 oligomers.",

    "title": "Reasons for Failed Trials of Disease-Modifying Treatments for Alzheimer Disease and Their Contribution in Recent Research.",
    "abstract": ": Despite all scientific efforts and many protracted and expensive clinical trials, no new drug has been approved by FDA for treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD) since 2003. Indeed, more than 200 investigational programs have failed or have been abandoned in the last decade. The most probable explanations for failures of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for AD may include late initiation of treatments during the course of AD development, inappropriate drug dosages, erroneous selection of treatment targets, and mainly an inadequate understanding of the complex pathophysiology of AD, which may necessitate combination treatments rather than monotherapy. Clinical trials' methodological issues have also been criticized. Drug-development research for AD is aimed to overcome these drawbacks. Preclinical and prodromal AD populations, as well as traditionally investigated populations representing all the clinical stages of AD, are included in recent trials. Systematic use of biomarkers in staging preclinical and prodromal AD and of a single primary outcome in trials of prodromal AD are regularly integrated. The application of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration biomarkers, including new biomarkers-such as Tau positron emission tomography, neurofilament light chain (blood and Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker of axonal degeneration) and neurogranin (CSF biomarker of synaptic functioning)-to clinical trials allows more precise staging of AD. Additionally, use of Bayesian statistics, modifiable clinical trial designs, and clinical trial simulators enrich the trial methodology. Besides, combination therapy regimens are assessed in clinical trials. The above-mentioned diagnostic and statistical advances, which have been recently integrated in clinical trials, are relevant to the recent failures of studies of disease-modifying treatments. Their experiential rather than theoretical origins may better equip potentially successful drug-development strategies.",

Understanding the regional-temporal evolution of amyloid pathology may enable earlier identification of subjects in the Alzheimer Disease pathologic continuum, as well as a finer-grained assessment of pathology beyond traditional dichotomous measures. This review summarizes current research in the detection of regional amyloid deposition patterns and its potential for staging amyloid pathology. Pathology studies, cross-sectional and longitudinal PET-only studies, and comparative PET and autopsy studies are included. Despite certain differences, cortical deposition generally precedes striatal pathology, and in PET-only studies, medial cortical regions are seen to accumulate amyloid earlier than lateral regions. Based on regional amyloid PET, multiple studies have developed and implemented models for staging amyloid pathology that could improve subject selection into secondary prevention trials and visual assessment in clinical routine.",

It was previously shown that a short fragment of Abeta peptide (KLVFF, 16-20) bound Abeta inhibited its aggregation. In this work, using KLVFF peptide, we synthesized two peptide families and then evaluated their inhibitory capacities by conventional assays such as thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence spectroscopy, turbidity measurement, and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS). The effect of peptide terminal groups on its inhibitory activity was first studied. Subsequently, the influence of halogenated amino acids on peptide anti-aggregation properties was investigated. We found that iodinated peptide with amine in the N and amide in the C termini, respectively, was the best inhibitor of Abeta fibers formation. Halogenated peptides seemed to decrease the number of Abeta fibrils; however, they did not reduce Abeta cytotoxicity. The data obtained in this work seemed promising in developing potential peptide drugs for treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Sestrins (SESNs) and sirtuins (SIRTs) are antioxidant and antiapoptotic genes and crucial mediators for lysosomal autophagy regulation that play a pivotal role in the Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, statins have been linked to the reduced prevalence of AD in statin-prescribed populations yet molecular basis for the neuroprotective action of statins is still under debate. METHODS: This study was undertaken whether Abeta-induced changes of SESN2 and SIRT1 protein expression, autophagy marker LC3II and lysosomal enzyme TPP1 affected by atorvastatin (Western blot) and its possible role in Abeta neurotoxicity (ELISA). KEY FINDINGS/RESULTS: We showed that SESN2 and LC3II expressions were elevated, whereas SIRT1 and TPP1 expressions were decreased in the Abeta1-42 -exposed human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). Co-administration of atorvastatin with Abeta1-42 compensates SESN2 increase and recovers SIRT1 decline by reducing oxidative stress, decreasing SESN2 expression and increasing SIRT1 expression by its neuroprotective action. Atorvastatin induced LC3II but not TPP1 level in the Abeta1-42 -exposed cells suggested that atorvastatin is effective in the formation of autophagosome but not on the expression of the specific lysosomal enzyme TPP1. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Together, these results indicate that atorvastatin induced SESN2, SIRT1 and LC3II levels play a protective role against Abeta1-42 neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Aggregations of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and alpha-synuclein (alphaS) into oligomeric and fibrillar assemblies are the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, respectively. Although Abeta and alphaS affect different regions of the brain and are separated at the cellular level, there is evidence of their eventual interaction in the pathology of both disorders. Characterization of interactions of Abeta and alphaS at various stages of their aggregation pathways could reveal mechanisms and therapeutic targets for the prevention and cure of these neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we comprehensively examined the interactions and their molecular manifestations using an array of characterization tools. We show for the first time that alphaS monomers and oligomers, but not alphaS fibrils, inhibit Abeta fibrillization while promoting oligomerization of Abeta monomers and stabilizing preformed Abeta oligomers via coassembly, as judged by Thioflavin T fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and SDS- and native-PAGE with fluorescently labeled peptides/proteins. In contrast, soluble Abeta species, such as monomers and oligomers, aggregate into fibrils, when incubated alone under the otherwise same condition. Our study provides evidence that the interactions with alphaS soluble species, responsible for the effects, are mediated primarily by the C-terminus of Abeta, when judged by competitive immunoassays using antibodies recognizing various fragments of Abeta. We also show that the C-terminus of Abeta is a primary site for its interaction with alphaS fibrils. Collectively, these data demonstrate aggregation state-specific interactions between alphaS and Abeta and offer insight into a molecular basis of synergistic biological effects between the two polypeptides.",

Conformational constraints in such peptidic scaffolds affect their copper-binding affinity, which can be tuned. In the present study, the ability of these peptides to compete with Abeta has been assessed in vitro, with the objective to examine whether such soft chelating agents may be used to lessen the deleterious interaction of Cu(II) with Abeta. Fluorescence spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry data show that the more constrained peptide, i.e., cyclic C-Asp, which displays a Cu(II)-binding affinity comparable to that of Abeta, is the only potential metal-protein attenuating compound (MPAC) candidate. In vitro aggregation studies with Abeta(1-40) reveal that C-Asp can hamper the formation of copper-stabilized oligomeric Abeta species, through capturing the metal ion prior to its interaction with monomeric Abeta. The present study shows that (cyclic) peptides, preorganized for Cu(II) binding, may be applied for the development of potential copper-Abeta attenuating compounds.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Many microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be aberrantly expressed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The present study aimed to explore the diagnostic value and neuroprotective role of miR-193a-3p in AD. METHODS: 108 sporadic AD patients and 93 healthy controls were included. An Abeta25-35 insult cellular AD model of PC12 and SH-SY5Y was established. The relative expression levels of miR-193a-3p were calculated using qRT-PCR. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to evaluate the usefulness of miR-193a-3p for detecting AD. Cell viability and apoptotic rates were calculated. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the interaction between miR-193a-3p and PTEN. RESULTS: miR-193a-3p expression was downregulated in both AD patients and the cellular AD model (all P < 0.001). Remarkable positive association was detected between serum miR-193a-3p level and MMSE score in AD patients (r = 0.5889, P < 0.0001). The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 89.8% and 77.4%, respectively, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.914. Overexpression of miR-193a-3p weakened Abeta25-35 induced cell viability inhibition, and reduced Abeta25-35 induced cell apoptosis in PC12 cells (all P < 0.01). Downregulation of miR-193a-3p intensified the effect of Abeta25-35 PTEN was proved to be the target gene of miR-193a-3p. CONCLUSION: MiR-193a-3p could be a novel biomarker for AD diagnosis, and may protect against neurotoxicity in AD by targeting PTEN.",

    "title": "Automatic identification of crossovers in cryo-EM images of murine amyloid protein A fibrils with machine learning.",
    "abstract": "Detecting crossovers in cryo-electron microscopy images of protein fibrils is an important step towards determining the morphological composition of a sample. Currently, the crossover locations are picked by hand, which introduces errors and is a time-consuming procedure. With the rise of deep learning in computer vision tasks, the automation of such problems has become more and more applicable. However, because of insufficient quality of raw data and missing labels, neural networks alone cannot be applied successfully to target the given problem. Thus, we propose an approach combining conventional computer vision techniques and deep learning to automatically detect fibril crossovers in two-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy image data and apply it to murine amyloid protein A fibrils, where we first use direct image processing methods to simplify the image data such that a convolutional neural network can be applied to the remaining segmentation problem. LAY DESCRIPTION: The ability of protein to form fibrillary structures underlies important cellular functions but can also give rise to disease, such as in a group of disorders, termed amyloid diseases. These diseases are characterised by the formation of abnormal protein filaments, so-called amyloid fibrils, that deposit inside the tissue. Many amyloid fibrils are helically twisted, which leads to periodic variations in the apparent width of the fibril, when observing amyloid fibrils using microscopy techniques like cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Due to the two-dimensional projection, parts of the fibril orthogonal to the projection plane appear narrower than parts parallel to the plane. The parts of small width are called crossovers. The distance between two adjacent crossovers is an important characteristic for the analysis of amyloid fibrils, because it is informative about the fibril morphology and because it can be determined from raw data by eye. A given protein can typically form different fibril morphologies. The morphology can vary depending on the chemical and physical conditions of fibril formation, but even when fibrils are formed under identical solution conditions, different morphologies may be present in a sample. As the crossovers allow to define fibril morphologies in a heterogeneous sample, detecting crossovers is an important first step in the sample analysis. In the present paper, we introduce a method for the automated detection of fibril crossovers in cryo-EM image data. The data consists of greyscale images, each showing an unknown number of potentially overlapping fibrils. In a first step, techniques from image analysis and pattern detection are employed to detect single fibrils in the raw data. Then, a convolutional neural network is used to find the locations of crossovers on each single fibril. As these predictions may contain errors, further postprocessing steps assess the quality and may slightly alter or reject the predicted crossovers.",

    "title": "Structural Interaction of Apolipoprotein A-I Mimetic Peptide with Amyloid-beta Generates Toxic Hetero-oligomers.",
    "abstract": "Apolipoproteins are involved in pathological conditions of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and it has been reported that truncated apolipoprotein fragments and beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides coexist as neurotoxic heteromers within the plaques. Therefore, it is important to investigate these complexes at the molecular level to better understand their properties and roles in the pathology of AD. Here, we present a mechanistic insight into such heteromerization using a structurally homologue apolipoprotein fragment of apoA-I (4F) complexed with Abeta(M1-42) and characterize their toxicity. The 4F peptide slows down the aggregation kinetics of Abeta(M1-42) by constraining its structural plasticity. NMR and CD experiments identified 4F-Abeta(M1-42) heteromers comprised of unstructured Abeta(M1-42) and helical 4F. A uniform two-fold reduction in 15N/1H NMR signal intensities of Abeta(M1-42) with no observable chemical shift perturbation indicated the formation of a large complex, which was further confirmed by diffusion NMR experiments. Microsecond-scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations showed that 4F interaction with Abeta(M1-42) is electrostatically driven and induces unfolding of Abeta(M1-42). Neurotoxicity profiling of Abeta(M1-42) complexed with 4F confirms a significant reduction in cell viability and neurite growth. Thus, the molecular architecture of heteromerization between 4F and Abeta(M1-42) discovered in this study provides evidence toward our understanding of the role of apolipoproteins or their truncated fragments in exacerbating AD pathology.",

In this review, I outline this relationship.

    "title": "Oligomeric Abeta in the monkey brain impacts synaptic integrity and induces accelerated cortical aging.",
    "abstract": "As the average age of the population continues to rise, the number of individuals affected with age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has increased and is projected to cost more than $290 billion in the United States in 2019. Despite significant investment in research over the last decades, there is no effective treatment to prevent or delay AD progression. There is a translational gap in AD research, with promising drugs based on work in rodent models failing in clinical trials. Aging is the leading risk factor for developing AD and understanding neurobiological changes that affect synaptic integrity with aging will help clarify why the aged brain is vulnerable to AD. We describe here the development of a rhesus monkey model of AD using soluble oligomers of the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide (AbetaOs). AbetaOs infused into the monkey brain target a specific population of spines in the prefrontal cortex, induce neuroinflammation, and increase AD biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid to similar levels observed in patients with AD. Importantly, AbetaOs lead to similar dendritic spine loss to that observed in normal aging in monkeys, but so far without detection of amyloid plaques or tau pathology. Understanding the basis of synaptic impairment is the most effective route to early intervention and prevention or postponement of age-related cognitive decline and transition to AD. These initial findings support the use of monkeys as a platform to understand age-related vulnerabilities of the primate brain and may help develop effective disease-modifying therapies for treatment of AD and related dementias.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins are the two cardinally pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, their exact roles in the mechanisms of AD progression are not well established. Given that AD is a disconnection syndrome and hypometabolism is one of its most important neurodegenerative indicators, we hypothesized amyloid-beta and tau burden may disturb the glucose metabolic network of AD. Here we investigated the relationship of these two factors to regional metabolic network properties using multimodal positron emission tomography (PET) imaging data. Participants included six groups covering from cognitively normal controls, patients with early cognitive impairment (MCI), late MCI, mild AD, moderate AD to severe AD who underwent amyloid-beta PET, tau PET and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. Glucose metabolic network of each group was constructed and relations of amyloid-beta and tau to regional metabolic network measurements were investigated. Results revealed distinct associations of these two hallmarks to metabolic networks: amyloid-beta were positively related to metabolic network measurements at relative early phases of AD, while tau burden showed a negative relationship at late phase of AD. These results supported the notion that amyloid-beta and tau accumulation may contribute independently to mechanisms of AD. Furthermore, these findings might also provide connectivity evidence for the speculation that amyloid-beta deposition is protective to neuronal activity.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Due to the high cost and high failure rate of ascertaining amyloid positron emission tomography positivity (PET+) in patients with earlier stage Alzheimer's disease (AD), an effective pre-screening tool for amyloid PET scans is needed. METHODS: Patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 33, 24.2% PET+, 42% females, age 74.4 +- 7.5, MMSE 26.8 +- 1.9) and mild dementia (n = 19, 63.6% PET+, 36.3% females, age 73.0 +- 9.3, MMSE 22.6 +- 2.0) were recruited. Amyloid PET imaging, Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping, and plasma amyloid beta (Abeta)1-40, Abeta1-42, and total tau protein quantification by immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) method were performed. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and Youden's index were performed to identify possible cut-off points, clinical sensitivities/specificities, and areas under the curve (AUCs). RESULTS: Amyloid PET+ participants had lower plasma Abeta1-42 levels than amyloid PET-negative (PET-) subjects. APOE epsilon4 carriers had higher plasma Abeta1-42 than non-carriers. We developed an algorithm involving the combination of plasma Abeta1-42 and APOE genotyping. The success rate for detecting amyloid PET+ patients effectively increased from 42.3 to 70.4% among clinically suspected MCI and mild dementia patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the possibility of utilizing APOE genotypes in combination with plasma Abeta1-42 levels as a pre-screening tool for predicting the positivity of amyloid PET findings in early stage dementia patients.",

As EVs may transfer between the brain and the blood, we have thus hypothesized that the total plasma EVs (pEVs) may contain potential markers to predict the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD progression. We have thus quantified AD-related proteins in isolated pEVs from controls, MCI and AD subjects. In pEVs, we observed early changes of total tau (tTau), amyloid precursor protein levels, and phospho-tau (pTau)-T181/tTau ratio from MCI subjects and late increases of Abeta42 and pTau-T181 levels from patients with moderate AD. Interestingly, abnormal amyloid precursor protein levels and pTau-T181/tTau ratio in pEVs demonstrated a high accuracy to define MCI and AD staging. Although larger samples sizes will be needed to generate well-powered investigations, these preliminary results highlighted the potential of AD-related proteins enriched in pEVs as a sensitive tool for differentiating patients with MCI to patients with AD and monitoring AD progression.",

    "abstract": "Traffic-related air pollution particulate matter (TRAP-PM) is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer Disease (AD). Rodent models respond to nano-sized TRAP-PM (nPM) with increased production of amyloid Abeta peptides, concurrently with oxidative damage. Because pro-Abeta processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) occurs on subcellular lipid rafts, we hypothesized that oxidative stress from nPM exposure would alter lipid rafts to favor Abeta production. This hypothesis was tested with J20 mice and N2a cells transgenic for hAPPswe (familial AD). Exposure of J20-APPswe mice to nPM for 150 h caused increased lipid oxidation (4-HNE) and increased the pro-amyloidogenic processing of APP in lipid raft fractions in cerebral cortex; the absence of these changes in cerebellum parallels the AD brain region selectivity for Abeta deposits. In vitro, nPM induced similar oxidative responses in N2a-APPswe cells, with dose-dependent production of NO, oxidative damage (4-HNE, 3NT), and lipid raft alterations of APP with increased Abeta peptides. The antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) attenuated nPM-induced oxidative damage and lipid raft alterations of APP processing. These findings identify neuronal lipid rafts as novel targets of oxidative damage in the pro-amyloidogenic effects of air pollution.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of copper homeostasis is associated with a number of severe diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Wilson's disease, and Menkes syndrome. Given this association, the detection and capture of Cu2+ in biological fluids and tissues may provide a new direction for the diagnosis and treatment of related disorders. The current analytical approaches, however, are challenging due to the high cost, complexity, and long time required to prepare and analyze samples. Here, we report a novel salen ligand, namely N,N'-(1,2-phenylene)bis(1-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)methanimine) (pimi), which can readily detect and concurrently capture Cu2+ from aqueous as well as biological mediums. Pimi can selectively and specifically detect Cu2+ from biofluid and cellular samples with rapid ccresponse time (<3 s) and an ultra-sensitive detecting limit (2.7 nM). More importantly, pimi showed excellent environmental tolerance and had a very wide pH range for detecting Cu2+ in a variety of biological samples. Attributed to the strong binding affinity and selectivity towards Cu2+, pimi was found to capture Cu2+ ions from Cu-Abeta complexes, thus inhibiting copper-induced aggregation of Abeta and protecting neuronal cells from the toxicity of aggregated Abeta. These results provide a compelling starting point for further fine-tuning of salen-based chemosensor for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases associated with the hyperaccumulation of copper.",

However, the precise role of GR in the pathophysiology of AD remains unclear. Using an acute model of AD induced by the intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid-beta oligomers (oAbeta), we analyzed cellular and behavioral hallmarks of AD, GR signaling pathways, processing of amyloid precursor protein, and enzymes involved in Tau phosphorylation. We focused on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly rich in GR, early altered in AD and involved in HPA axis control and cognitive functions. We found that oAbeta impaired cognitive and emotional behaviors, increased plasma GC levels, synaptic deficits, apoptosis and neuroinflammatory processes. Moreover, oAbeta potentiated the amyloidogenic pathway and enzymes involved both in Tau hyperphosphorylation and GR activation. Treatment with a selective GR modulator (sGRm) normalized plasma GC levels and all behavioral and biochemical parameters analyzed. GR seems to occupy a central position in the pathophysiology of AD. Deregulation of the HPA axis and a feed-forward effect on PFC GR sensitivity could participate in the etiology of AD, in perturbing Abeta and Tau homeostasis. These results also reinforce the therapeutic potential of sGRm in AD.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of the human tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles is directly diagnostic of many neurodegenerative conditions termed tauopathies. The species, factors and events that are responsible for the initiation and propagation of tau aggregation are not clearly established, even in a simplified and artificial in vitro system. This motivates the mechanistic study of in vitro aggregation of recombinant tau from soluble to fibrillar forms, for which polyanionic cofactors are the most commonly used external inducer. In this study, we performed biophysical characterizations to unravel the mechanisms by which cofactors induce fibrillization. We first reinforce the idea that cofactors are the limiting factor to generate ThT-active tau fibrils, and establish that they act as templating reactant that trigger tau conformational rearrangement. We show that heparin has superior potency for recruiting monomeric tau into aggregation-competent species compared to any constituent intermediate or aggregate \"seeds.\" We show that tau and cofactors form intermediate complexes whose evolution toward ThT-active fibrils is tightly regulated by tau-cofactor interactions. Remarkably, it is possible to find mild cofactors that complex with tau without forming ThT-active species, except when an external catalyst (e.g., a seed) is provided to overcome the energy barrier. In a cellular context, we propose the idea that tau could associate with cofactors to form a metastable complex that remains \"inert\" and reversible, until encountering a relevant seed that can trigger an irreversible transition to beta-sheet containing species.",

    "title": "Modification of Abeta Peptide Aggregation via Covalent Binding of a Series of Ru(III) Complexes.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, leading to loss of cognition, and eventually death. The disease is characterized by the formation of extracellular aggregates of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein inside cells, and oxidative stress. In this study, we investigate a series of Ru(III) complexes (Ru-N) derived from NAMI-A in which the imidazole ligand has been substituted for pyridine derivatives, as potential therapeutics for AD. The ability of the Ru-N series to bind to Abeta was evaluated by NMR and ESI-MS, and their influence on the Abeta peptide aggregation process was investigated via electrophoresis gel/western blot, TEM, turbidity, and Bradford assays. The complexes were shown to bind covalently to the Abeta peptide, likely via a His residue. Upon binding, the complexes promote the formation of soluble high molecular weight aggregates, in comparison to peptide precipitation for peptide alone. In addition, TEM analysis supports both amorphous and fibrillar aggregate morphology for Ru-N treatments, while only large amorphous aggregates are observed for peptide alone. Overall, our results show that the Ru-N complexes modulate Abeta peptide aggregation, however, the change in the size of the pyridine ligand does not substantially alter the Abeta aggregation process.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid and tau pathological accumulation should be considered for Alzheimer's disease (AD) definition and before subjects' enrollment in disease-modifying trials. Although age, APOEepsilon4, and sex influence cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker levels, none of these variables are considered by current normality/abnormality cutoffs. Using baseline CSF data from 2 independent cohorts (PharmaCOG/European Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative), we investigated the effect of age, APOEepsilon4 status, and sex on CSF Abeta42/P-tau distribution and cutoff extraction by applying mixture models with covariates. The Abeta42/P-tau distribution revealed the presence of 3 subgroups (AD-like, intermediate, control-like) and 2 cutoffs. The identification of the intermediate subgroup and of the higher cutoff was APOEepsilon4 dependent in both cohorts. APOE-specific classification (higher cutoff for APOEepsilon4+, lower cutoff for APOEepsilon4-) showed higher diagnostic accuracy in identifying MCI due to AD compared to single Abeta42 and Abeta42/P-tau cutoffs. APOEepsilon4 influences amyloid and tau CSF markers and AD progression in MCI patients supporting i) the use of APOE-specific cutoffs to identify MCI due to AD and ii) the utility of considering APOE genotype for early AD diagnosis.",

    "title": "Alleviation of symptoms of Alzheimer's disease by diminishing Abeta neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevailing neurodegenerative illnesses in the elderly. Accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and inflammation play critical roles in the pathogenesis and development of AD. Multi-target drugs may interdict the progress of AD through a synergistic mechanism. A neuromodulator, 2-((1H-benzo[d]imidazole-2-yl)methoxy)benzoic acid (BIBA), consisting of an Abeta-targeting group and a derivative of anti-inflammatory aspirin was designed as a potential anti-AD agent. BIBA exhibits a remarkable inhibitory effect on the self- and metal-induced Abeta aggregations and shows outstanding anti-inflammatory activity simultaneously. The neurotoxicity of Abeta aggregates is attenuated, and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs), such as IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, in microglia stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Abeta is reduced. Owing to the synergy between the inhibition of Abeta oligomerization and downregulation of PICs, BIBA markedly prolongs the lifespan and relieves the Abeta-induced paralysis of Abeta-transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans, thus showing the potential to ameliorate the symptoms of AD through inhibiting Abeta neurotoxicity and deactivating microglia. These findings demonstrate that both Abeta aggregation and neuroinflammation are therapeutic targets for anti-AD drugs, and dual-functional agents that integrate anti-Abeta and anti-inflammatory capabilities have great advantages over the traditional single-target agents for AD treatment.",

We describe here the use of a graphene-gold hybrid plasmonic platform that enables quantitative SERS measurement. Quantification is enabled by normalizing analyte peak intensities to that of the graphene G peak. We show that two complementary quantification modes are intrinsic features of the platform, and that through their combined use, the platform enables accurate determination of analyte concentration over a concentration range spanning seven orders of magnitude. We demonstrate, using a biologically relevant test analyte, the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), a seminal pathologic agent of Alzheimer's disease (AD), that linear relationships exist between (a) peak intensity and concentration at a single plasmonic hot spot smaller than 100 nm, and (b) frequency of hot spots with observable protein signals, i.e. the co-location of an Abeta protein and a hot spot. We demonstrate the detection of Abeta at a concentration as low as 10-18 M after a single 20 mul aliquot of the analyte onto the hybrid platform. This detection sensitivity can be improved further through multiple applications of analyte to the platform and by rastering the laser beam with smaller step sizes.",
