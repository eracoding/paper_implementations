    "abstract": "The catecholamines dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) are neurotransmitters and hormones that mediate stress responses in tissues and plasma. The expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is responsive to stress and is high in tissues rich in catecholamines. We recently reported that APP is a ferroxidase, subsuming, in neurons and other cells, the iron-export activity that ceruloplasmin mediates in glia. Here we report that, like ceruloplasmin, APP also oxidizes synthetic amines and catecholamines catalytically (K(m) NE=0.27 mM), through a site encompassing its ferroxidase motif and selectively inhibited by zinc. Accordingly, APP knockout mice have significantly higher levels of DA, NE and E in brain, plasma and select tissues. Consistent with this, these animals have increased resting heart rate and systolic blood pressure as well as suppressed prolactin and lymphocyte levels. These findings support a role for APP in extracellular catecholaminergic clearance.",

    "abstract": "Ginsenoside Rg1, an active component of high abundance in ginseng, has recently been reported to possess neuroprotective properties and also identified as a potent phytoestrogen. However, it is unknown whether Rg1 intervenes in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, and whether such intervention is associated with its estrogenic activity. Using human platelets, this study demonstrated that Rg1 promoted alpha-secretase cleavage of APP via estrogenic activity. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway may be involved in the effect of Rg1 on APP metabolism as a downstream effector of estrogen receptor (ER) extranuclear signaling. Estrogen withdrawal is a risk factor for the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rg1 exerts estrogenic activity in APP processing in platelets supporting the use of this compound in the prevention of AD, in particular in postmenopausal females.",

    "abstract": "Deposition of aggregated amyloid beta (Abeta) is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-a common age-related neurodegenerative disorder. Typically, Abeta is generated as a peptide of varying lengths. However, a major fraction of Abeta peptides in the brains of AD patients has undergone posttranslational modifications, which often radically change the properties of the peptides. Abeta3(pE)-42 is an N-truncated, pyroglutamate-modified variant that is abundantly present in AD brain and was suggested to play a role early in the pathogenesis. Here we show that intracellular accumulation of oligomeric aggregates of Abeta3(pE)-42 results in loss of lysosomal integrity. Using a novel antibody specific for aggregates of AbetapE3, we show that in postmortem human brain tissue, aggregated AbetapE3 is predominantly found in the lysosomes of both neurons and glial cells. Our data further demonstrate that AbetapE3 is relatively resistant to lysosomal degradation, which may explain its accumulation in the lysosomes. The intracellular AbetapE3 aggregates increase in an age-dependent manner. The results presented in this study support a model where Abeta pathology and aging converge, leading to accumulation of the degradation-resistant pE-modified Abeta in the lysosomes, lysosomal dysfunction, and neurodegeneration.",

HrBACE1-IMER was inserted into a liquid chromatograph coupled with a fluorescent detector. A fluorogenic peptide substrate (M-2420), containing the beta-secretase site of the Swedish mutation of APP, was injected and cleaved in the on-line HPLC-hrBACE1-IMER system, giving rise to the fluorescent product. The compounds of the library were tested for their ability to inhibit BACE1 in the immobilized format and to reduce the area related to the chromatographic peak of the fluorescent enzymatic product. The results were validated in solution by using two different FRET methods. Due to the efficient virtual screening methodology, more than fifty percent of the selected compounds showed a measurable inhibitory activity. One of the most active compound (a bis-indanone derivative) was characterized in terms of IC(50) and K(i) determination on the hrBACE1-IMER. Thus, the hrBACE1-IMER has been confirmed as a valid tool for the throughput screening of different chemical entities with potency lower than 30muM for the fast hits' selection and for mode of action determination.",

    "abstract": "Deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) as senile plaques and disrupted glucose metabolism are two main characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is unknown, however, how these two processes are related in AD. Here we examined the relationship between O-GlcNAcylation, which is a glucose level-dependent post-translational modification that adds O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) to proteins, and Abeta production in a mouse model of AD carrying 5XFAD genes. We found that 1,2-dideoxy-2'-propyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoso-[2,1-D]-Delta2'-thiazoline (NButGT), a specific inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase, reduces Abeta production by lowering gamma-secretase activity both in vitro and in vivo. We also found that O-GlcNAcylation takes place at the S708 residue of nicastrin, which is a component of gamma-secretase. Moreover, NButGT attenuated the accumulation of Abeta, neuroinflammation, and memory impairment in the 5XFAD mice. This is the first study to show the relationship between Abeta generation and O-GlcNAcylation in vivo. These results suggest that O-GlcNAcylation may be a suitable therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.",

Longitudinal data from cognitively normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were used to calculate sample size requirements for trials using outcome measures, including the Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum of boxes, Mini-Mental State Examination, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale with and without delayed recall, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task. We examined the impact on sample sizes of enrichment for genetic and biomarker criteria, including cerebrospinal fluid protein and neuroimaging analyses. We observed little cognitive decline in the CN population at 36 months, regardless of the enrichment strategy. Nonetheless, in CN subjects, using Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task total as an outcome at 36 months required the fewest subjects across enrichment strategies, with apolipoprotein E genotype epsilon4 carrier status requiring the fewest (n = 499 per arm to demonstrate a 25% reduction in disease progression). In MCI, enrichment reduced the required sample sizes for trials, relative to estimates based on all subjects. For MCI, the Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum of boxes consistently required the smallest sample sizes. We conclude that predementia clinical trial conduct in Alzheimer's disease is enhanced by the use of biomarker inclusion criteria.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have compared the processing of endogenous human amyloid precursor protein (APP) in younger and older neurons. Here, we characterized LUHMES cells as a human model to study Alzheimer's disease-related processes during neuronal maturation and aging. Differentiated LUHMES expressed and spontaneously processed APP via the secretase pathways, and they secreted amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide. This was inhibited by cholesterol depletion or secretase inhibition, but not by block of tau phosphorylation. In vitro aged cells increased Abeta secretion without upregulation of APP or secretases. We identified the medium constituent glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) as responsible for this effect. GDNF-triggered Abeta release was associated with rapid upregulation of the GDNF coreceptor \"rearranged during transfection\" (RET). Other direct (neurturin) or indirect (nerve growth factor) RET activators also increased Abeta, whereas different neurotrophins were ineffective. Downstream of RET, we found activation of protein kinase B (AKT) to be involved. Accordingly, inhibitors of the AKT regulator phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase completely blocked GDNF-triggered AKT phosphorylation and Abeta increase. This suggests that RET signaling affects Abeta release from aging neurons.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is characterized neuropathologically by brainstem and cortical Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, neuronal loss in brainstem nuclei, and Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. Previous studies have suggested that spongiform change in the entorhinal cortex may also be a pathologic feature; however, this change has not been well characterized. DESIGN/METHOD: An autopsy series of 40 subjects with DLB and 40 subjects with AD were matched on age, sex, and last Mini Mental State Examination before death. Using semistereological methods on representative sections through the transentorhinal and perirhinal cortices, quantitative counts and semiquantitative grading of vacuolization were performed by 1 rater (A.S.) blinded to subjects' diagnoses. In addition, electron microscopy of representative sections was performed. RESULTS: Vacuolization was 4- to 5-fold more prominent in the perirhinal, as compared with transentorhinal, cortex. Moderate to severe vacuolization was found in 57.5% of DLB, but only 7.5% of AD subjects. There were statistically significant differences between mean numbers of vacuoles in the perirhinal (DLB mean=27.91; AD mean=2.35; P<0.001) and transentorhinal (DLB mean=5.92; AD mean=0.5; P<0.001) cortices in DLB as well as AD cases. Electron microscopy revealed both axonal and dendritic pathology, with dilatation, vacuole formation, and abnormal membranous profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated, vacuolization seems to be more specific for DLB than AD, with disproportionate involvement of the perirhinal cortex.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice modeling Alzheimer's disease display frequent occurrence of seizures peaking at an age when amyloid plaques start to form in the cortex and hippocampus. We tested the hypothesis that numerous reported interactions of amyloid-beta with cell surface molecules result in altered excitation-inhibition balance in brain-wide neural networks, eventually leading to epileptogenesis. We examined electroencephalograms (EEGs) and auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) in freely moving 4-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 (APdE9) and wild-type (WT) control mice in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and thalamus during movement, quiet waking, non-rapid eye movement sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Cortical EEG power was higher in APdE9 mice than in WT mice over a broad frequency range (5-100 Hz) and during all 4 behavioral states. Thalamic EEG power was also increased but in a narrower range (10-80 Hz). Furthermore, APdE9 mice displayed augmented cortical and thalamic AEPs. While power and theta-gamma modulation were preserved in the APdE9 hippocampus, REM sleep-related phase shift of theta-gamma modulation was altered. Our data suggest that at the early stage of amyloid pathology, cortical principal cells become hyperexcitable and via extensive cortico-thalamic connection drive thalamic cells. Minor hippocampal changes are most likely secondary to abnormal entorhinal input.",

    "title": "Accumulation of a repulsive axonal guidance molecule RGMa in amyloid plaques: a possible hallmark of regenerative failure in Alzheimer's disease brains.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: RGMa is a repulsive guidance molecule that induces the collapse of axonal growth cones by interacting with the receptor neogenin in the central nervous system during development. It remains unknown whether RGMa plays a role in the neurodegenerative process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesize that RGMa, if it is concentrated on amyloid plaques, might contribute to a regenerative failure of degenerating axons in AD brains. METHODS: By immunohistochemistry, we studied RGMa and neogenin (NEO1) expression in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus of 6 AD and 12 control cases. The levels of RGMa expression were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot in cultured human astrocytes following exposure to cytokines and amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides. RESULTS: In AD brains, an intense RGMa immunoreactivity was identified on amyloid plaques and in the glial scar. In the control brains, the glial scar and vascular foot processes of astrocytes expressed RGMa immunoreactivity, while oligodendrocytes and microglia were negative for RGMa. In AD brains, a small subset of amyloid plaques expressed a weak NEO1 immunoreactivity, while some reactive astrocytes in both AD and control brains showed an intense NEO1 immunoreactivity. In human astrocytes, transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFbeta1 ), Abeta 1-40 or Abeta 1-42 markedly elevated the levels of RGMa, and TGFbeta1 also increased its own levels. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis validated the molecular interaction between RGMa and the C-terminal fragment beta of amyloid beta precursor protein (APP). Furthermore, recombinant RGMa protein interacted with amyloid plaques in situ. CONCLUSIONS: RGMa, produced by TGFbeta-activated astrocytes and accumulated in amyloid plaques and the glial scar, could contribute to the regenerative failure of degenerating axons in AD brains.",

Posteromedial cortices (PMCs) are particularly vulnerable to early amyloid pathology and play a role in both encoding and retrieval processes. The extent to which aging and amyloid influence the ability to modulate activity between these processes within the PMC was investigated by combining positron emission tomography-amyloid imaging with functional magnetic resonance imaging in cognitively normal older and young adults. Young subjects exhibited a marked decrease in activity during encoding and an increase during retrieval (also known as encoding/retrieval \"flip\"). Impaired ability to modulate activity was associated with increasing age, greater amyloid burden, and worse memory performance. In contrast, the hippocampus showed increased activity during both encoding and retrieval, which was not related to these variables. These findings support a specific link between amyloid pathology and neural dysfunction in PMC and elucidate the underpinnings of age-related memory dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Synapses are considered the earliest site of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, where synapse density is reduced, and synaptic loss is highly correlated with cognitive impairment. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) has been shown to be neuroprotective in several models of AD, including neuronal exposure to amyloid beta (Abeta) and amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) double-transgenic mice. Here, we show that TUDCA modulates synaptic deficits induced by Abeta in vitro. Specifically, TUDCA reduced the downregulation of the postsynaptic marker postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and the decrease in spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) frequency, while increasing the number of dendritic spines. This contributed to the induction of more robust and synaptically efficient neurons, reflected in inhibition of neuronal death. In vivo, TUDCA treatment of APP/PS1 mice abrogated the decrease in PSD-95 reactivity in the hippocampus. Taken together, these results expand the neuroprotective role of TUDCA to a synaptic level, further supporting the use of this molecule as a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of AD.",

In an unbiased screening for antibodies directed against brain proteins, we found in AD patients high serum levels of antibodies against the neuronal cytoskeletal protein ankyrin G (ankG); these correlated with slower rates of cognitive decline. Neuronal expression of ankG was higher in AD brains than in nondemented age-matched healthy control subjects. AnkG was present in exosomal vesicles, and it accumulated in beta-amyloid plaques. Active immunization with ankG of arcAbeta transgenic mice reduced brain beta-amyloid pathology and increased brain levels of soluble Abeta(42). AnkG immunization induced a reduction in beta-amyloid pathology, also in Swedish transgenic mice(.) Anti-ankG monoclonal antibodies reduced Abeta-induced loss of dendritic spines in hippocampal ArcAbeta organotypic cultures. Together, these data established a role for ankG in the human adaptive immune response against resident brain proteins, and they show that ankG immunization reduces brain beta-amyloid and its related neuropathology.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 100 years, there has been an exponential increase in our understanding of the underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This growth in knowledge has largely stemmed from the intensification of research into AD which has occurred over the past three decades and the incorporation of the amyloid cascade hypothesis as the generally accepted dogma of AD pathogenesis. While at times contentious, the notion that AD arises from aberrations in amyloid-beta (Abeta) production and degradation has led to a number of significant breakthroughs in the way in which AD is currently diagnosed and in the attempts at disease modifying therapies, from investigations into the underlying factors mediating the aggregation of Abeta to the development of therapeutic strategies and measures of neuroimaging allowing Abeta burden to be monitored within the AD-affected brain. This review focuses on some of the recent work we have conducted toward elucidating the role of Abeta in AD.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of radiotracers for the non-invasive in vivo quantification of amyloid-beta (Abeta) burden in the brain has revolutionized the approach to the evaluation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta burden as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) matches histopathological reports of Abeta distribution in aging and dementia. It appears more accurate than FDG for the diagnosis of AD, and is an excellent aid in the differential diagnosis of AD from frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Apolipoprotein E 4 carriers, independent of diagnosis or disease severity, present with higher Abeta burden than non-4 carriers. As new therapies enter clinical trials, the role of Abeta imaging in vivo is becoming increasingly crucial. Abeta imaging allows the in vivo assessment of brain Abeta pathology and its changes over time, providing highly accurate, reliable, and reproducible quantitative statements of regional or global Abeta burden in the brain, essential for therapeutic trial recruitment and for the evaluation of anti-Abeta treatments. Although Abeta burden as assessed by PET does not strongly correlate with cognitive impairment in AD, it does correlate with memory impairment and a higher risk for cognitive decline in the aging population and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects. This correlation with memory impairment, one of the earliest symptoms of AD, suggests that Abeta deposition is not part of normal aging, supporting the hypothesis that Abeta deposition occurs well before the onset of symptoms and likely represents preclinical AD in asymptomatic individuals and prodromal AD in MCI. Further longitudinal observations, coupled with different disease-specific biomarkers to assess potential downstream effects of Abeta, are required to confirm this hypothesis and further elucidate the role of Abeta deposition in the course of AD.",

    "abstract": "Levels of educational and occupational attainment, as components of cognitive reserve, may modify the relationship between the pathological hallmarks and cognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined whether exposure of a Tg2576 transgenic mouse model of AD to environmental enrichment (EE) at a specific period during the amyloidogenic process favored the establishment of a cognitive reserve. We found that exposure to EE during early adulthood of Tg2576 mice--before amyloidogenesis has started--reduced the severity of AD-related cognitive deficits more efficiently than exposure later in life, when the pathology is already present. Interestingly, early-life exposure to EE, while slightly reducing forebrain surface covered by amyloid plaques, did not significantly impact aberrant inhibitory remodeling in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice. Thus, transient early-life exposure to EE exerts long-lasting protection against cognitive impairment during AD pathology. In addition, these data define the existence of a specific life time frame during which stimulatory activity most efficiently builds a cognitive reserve, limiting AD progression and favoring successful aging.",

Little is known about the demographic and medical correlates of plasma Abeta40 or Abeta42. In 997 community-dwelling, nondemented older adults from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study, we determined the cross-sectional association between a wide range of demographic and medical variables with Abeta40 and Abeta42. In multivariate stepwise linear regression models, Abeta40 was significantly associated with race (beta=-14.70, F=22.01, P<0.0001), age (beta=1.34, F=6.39, P=0.01), creatinine (beta=52.91, F=151.77, P<0.0001), and the serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (beta=-0.0004, F=7.34, P=0.007); Abeta42 was significantly associated with race (beta=-3.72, F=30.83, P<0.0001), sex (beta=1.39, F=4.32, P=0.04), education (beta=1.50, F=4.78, P=0.03), apolipoprotein E e4 genotype (beta=-2.82, F=16.57, P<0.0001), and creatinine (beta=9.32, F=120.09, P<0.0001). These correlates should be considered as potential confounders in future studies investigating plasma Abeta as a biomarker of dementia. Understanding fully how these correlates mediate or modify the association between plasma Abeta and dementia will be a fundamental step in determining the biological pathways through which plasma Abeta40 and Abeta42 are associated with dementia, and in determining their full potential as biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have highlighted the potential physiopathological and diagnostic role of N- and C-terminally truncated amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in Alzheimer's disease. However, our knowledge about their production remains incomplete, in part due to the lack of very specific and sensitive tools for their detection. We thus developed specific monoclonal antibodies that target either Abeta11-x or Abeta17-x species, which result from the combined cleavages by beta/gamma- or alpha/gamma-secretases, respectively. The presence of Abeta peptides truncated at residue 11 and 17 peptides was qualitatively and quantitatively assessed, using surface enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and xMAP (Multi-Analyte Profiling) immunoassays, in the supernatant of HEK293 cells that overexpress wild type or mutant Abeta protein precursor or in which alpha- and beta-secretase activities had been modulated. Our results show a differential secretion of Abeta11-40 and Abeta17-40 species by these HEK293 cell lines. Finally, Abeta11-40 concentration in human cerebrospinal fluid (measured with the new xMAP immunoassays) from a first pilot study was higher in cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease than in samples from patients with other types of dementia.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological evidence implies a role for chronic stress and stress-related disorders in the etiopathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although chronic stress exposure during various stages of life has been shown to exacerbate AD-related cognitive deficits and neuropathology in AD mouse models, the role of stress exposure during the prenatal period on AD development and progression remained to be investigated. The present study therefore explored the effects of prenatal maternal stress (PMS) in both male and female APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse offspring in terms of cognition, affect, and AD-related neuropathology. As prenatal perturbations are likely to mediate their effects via alterations in epigenetic regulation, changes in hippocampal DNA methyltransferase 3a, 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels were assessed as underlying mechanisms. Repetitive restraint stress during the first week of gestation exerted a sex-dependent effect, with male PMS mice showing spatial memory deficits and a blunted hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis response, while female PMS mice showed improved spatial memory performance, increased depressive-like behavior, as well as a decrease in hippocampal plaque load. In addition, sex differences were observed among APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, independent of PMS (i.e., female mice showed impaired spatial memory performance, higher hippocampal plaque load, altered amyloid precursor protein processing in the CA3 and lower DNA methyltransferase 3a immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus when compared with male mice of the same age). In conclusion, PMS exposure impacts on the behavioral phenotype and neuropathology of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Moreover, given the remarkable sex differences observed, one should not overlook the impact of sex-specific responses to environmental exposures when investigating gene-environment interactions in AD.",

The treated rats were subjected to bilateral intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta(25-35) with or without subsequent dietary exposure to Scu. Learning and memory were assessed with the Morris water maze test; the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) were assayed biochemically; expression of the interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) proteins was determined by immunohistochemistry; and neuronal apoptosis was detected with Annexin staining followed by flow cytometry. The animals treated with Abeta exhibited impaired learning and memory; reduced SOD and elevated MAO activity, elevated protein levels of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha; and a higher percentage of apoptotic neurons in the brain. Interestingly, all of these effects were ameliorated by administration of Scu. These findings indicate that the deficits in learning and memory demonstrated by the rats receiving Abeta are due to elevated oxidative stress and inflammation, which result in apoptosis and that Scu may prevent these deleterious effects.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: Mitochondrial ferritin (MtFt), which was recently discovered, plays an important role in preventing neuronal damage in 6-hydroxydopamine-induced Parkinsonism by maintaining mitochondrial iron homeostasis. Disruption of iron regulation also plays a key role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To explore the potential neuroprotective roles of MtFt, rats and cells were treated with Abeta(25-35) to establish an AD model. RESULTS: We report that knockdown of MtFt expression significantly enhanced Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity as shown by dysregulation of iron homeostasis, enhanced oxidative stress, and increased cell apoptosis. Opposite results were obtained when MtFt was overexpressed in SH-SY5Y cells prior to treatment with Abeta(25-35). Further, MtFt inhibited Abeta(25-35)-induced P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) signaling. INNOVATION: MtFt attenuated Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity and reduced oxidative damage through Erk/P38 kinase signaling. CONCLUSION: Our results show a protective role of MtFt in AD and suggest that regulation of MtFt expression in neuronal cells may provide a new neuroprotective strategy for AD.",

Among these factors, chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is an early component of AD pathogenesis that can predict the progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD. Here, we investigated the effects of a protocol of mild chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in the APPswe/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD. We observed that the permanent occlusion of the right common carotid artery induced spatial learning impairments in young APPswe/PS1 mice, but not in their wild type littermates. Furthermore, the extent of learning deficits strongly correlated with the number of cortical beta-amyloid plaques, with the mobilization of monocytes into the blood and with the number of bone marrow-derived microglia in the brain. These results indicate that a mild reduction of cerebral blood flow can selectively induce cognitive deficits at an early stage of amyloid pathology, eliciting a cellular innate immune response, even without causing neuronal death.",

After a pilot study in wild type mice, performance of 8- and 16-month-old tg2576 mice were assessed in several behavioral tasks with the challenge of selecting 1 or more task(s) showing robust memory deficits on this genetic background. Water maze acquisition was impossible in rd homozygotes, whereas Y-maze alternation, object recognition, and olfactory discrimination were unaffected by both the transgene and the rd mutation. Spatial memory retention of 8- and 16-month-old tg2576 mice, however, was dramatically affected independently of the rd mutation when mice had to recognize a spatial configuration of objects or to perform the Barnes maze. Thus, the latter tasks appear extremely useful to evaluate spatial memory deficits and to test cognitive therapies in tg2576 mice and other mouse models bred on a background susceptible to visual impairment.",

The deposition reaction was monitored over 40 h, and the deposition rate was deduced. Among the agitation nuclei, the maximum deposition rate was observed on the nucleus grown at pH 4.6. However, ultrasonication nucleus grown at pH 7.4 produced much larger deposition rate, despite the same beta-sheet concentration. This result indicates that local structural modulation is caused in the nucleus by ultrasonication, which adsorbs the Abeta peptide more actively than other nuclei.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Degeneration of the locus coeruleus (LC), the major noradrenergic nucleus in the brain, occurs early and is ubiquitous in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Experimental lesions to the LC exacerbate AD-like neuropathology and cognitive deficits in several transgenic mouse models of AD. Because the LC contains multiple neuromodulators known to affect amyloid beta toxicity and cognitive function, the specific role of noradrenaline (NA) in AD is not well understood. METHODS: To determine the consequences of selective NA deficiency in an AD mouse model, we crossed dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) knockout mice with amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) mice overexpressing mutant APP and PS1. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (-/-) mice are unable to synthesize NA but otherwise have normal LC neurons and co-transmitters. Spatial memory, hippocampal long-term potentiation, and synaptic protein levels were assessed. RESULTS: The modest impairments in spatial memory and hippocampal long-term potentiation displayed by young APP/PS1 or DBH (-/-) single mutant mice were augmented in DBH (-/-)/APP/PS1 double mutant mice. Deficits were associated with reduced levels of total calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2A and increased N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B levels and were independent of amyloid beta accumulation. Spatial memory performance was partly improved by treatment with the NA precursor drug L-threo-dihydroxyphenylserine. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that early LC degeneration and subsequent NA deficiency in AD may contribute to cognitive deficits via altered levels of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and suggest that NA supplementation could be beneficial in early AD.",

    "abstract": "The Chinese hamster ovary cell line 7PA2, stably transfected with the 751 amino acid isoform of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) containing the Val   Phe mutation at residue 717, is one of the most used models to study the biochemistry and toxicity of secreted amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, particularly Abeta oligomers, which are considered to be of relevance to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we present a detailed immunochemical and mass spectrometric characterization of primary structures of Abeta peptides secreted by 7PA2 cells. Immunoprecipitation and western blot of 7PA2 cell culture media revealed abundant anti-Abeta immunoreactive bands in the molecular weight range of 4-20 kDa. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that these bands contain several AbetaPP/Abeta peptides, starting at the N-terminal of the Abeta sequence and extending across the BACE1 cleavage site. Treatment of cells with a BACE1 inhibitor decreased the abundance of the Abeta monomer band by western blot and resulted in lower levels of Abeta1-40, Abeta1-42, and sAbetaPPbeta as measured by ELISA. However, western blot bands thought to represent oligomers of Abeta increased in response to BACE1 inhibition. This increase was paralleled by the emergence of N-terminally truncated Abeta species (Abeta5-40 in particular) and Abeta species that spanned the beta-secretase site in AbetaPP according to mass spectrometric analyses. The formation of these AbetaPP/Abeta peptides may have implications for the use of the 7PA2 cell line as a model for Abeta pathology. The enzyme(s) responsible for this particular BACE1-independent AbetaPP-processing remains to be identified.",

Five-hundred and forty six cognitively intact participants (aged 60-95 years) from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing (AIBL) were included in these analyses. Habitual physical activity levels were measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Serum insulin, glucose, cholesterol and plasma Abeta levels were measured in fasting blood samples. A subgroup (n=116) underwent (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) scanning to quantify brain amyloid load. Higher levels of physical activity were associated with higher high density lipoprotein (HDL) (P=0.037), and lower insulin (P<0.001), triglycerides (P=0.019) and Abeta1-42/1-40 ratio (P=0.001). After stratification of the cohort based on APOE epsilon4 allele carriage, it was evident that only non-carriers received the benefit of reduced plasma Abeta from physical activity. Conversely, lower levels of PiB SUVR (standardised uptake value ratio) were observed in higher exercising APOE epsilon4 carriers. Lower plasma Abeta1-42/1-40 and brain amyloid was observed in those reporting higher levels of physical activity, consistent with the hypothesis that physical activity may be involved in the modulation of pathogenic changes associated with AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative process characterized, in part, by the accumulation of beta-amyloid proteins (Abeta) in the brain. Evidence now suggests that the excessive Abeta accumulation is the result of impaired clearance from the brain. Recent studies have indicated that retinoid X receptor (RXR) activation stimulates the metabolic clearance of Abeta and rapidly reverses Abeta-induced behavioral deficits, doing so in an apoE-dependent manner. Previously, we reported that soluble apoE (i.e., not bound to Abeta) facilitated Abeta transit across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). As Abeta clearance from the brain involves both metabolic and BBB-mediated processes, the current studies investigated the impact of RXR stimulation on Abeta clearance across the BBB. Treatment with RXR agonists increased Abeta clearance across the BBB both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, this processes appeared to involve apoE as RXR agonism did not stimulate Abeta BBB clearance when apoE was absent. Thus, RXR activation could mitigate Abeta brain burden by promoting both the metabolic and BBB clearance of Abeta, offering a novel approach to the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Vascular disorders can either be cause or consequence in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To comprehensively characterize the occurrence of vascular impairment in a double transgenic mouse model for AD (APPswe/PS1dE9) during aging, we developed a new method to obtain microvascular relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV(micro)) maps from gradient echo MR imaging by histogram evaluation and we applied a voxel-wise approach to detect rCBV(micro) changes. With this methodology the development of cerebral microvascular impairments can be described in vivo with 0.16 mm isotropic resolution for the whole mouse brain. At 8 months, impaired rCBV(micro) appeared in some cortical regions and in the thalamus, which spreads over several sub-cortical areas and the hippocampus at 13 months. With a ROI-based approach, we further showed that hippocampal rCBV(micro) in 13-month-old wild-type and APP(swe)/PS1(dE9) mice correlates well with capillary density measured with immunohistochemical staining. However, no differences in capillary density were detected between genotypes. The rCBV(micro) values showed no significant correlation with amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque deposition, Abeta at blood vessel walls and biochemically measured levels of Abeta1-40, Abeta1-42 oligomers and fibrillar forms. These results suggest that rCBV(micro) reduction is caused by an impaired vasoactivity of capillaries and arterioles, which is not directly correlated with the amount of Abeta deposition in parenchyma nor blood vessel walls.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease is the most prevalent form of dementia globally and is characterized premortem by a gradual memory loss and deterioration of higher cognitive functions and postmortem by neuritic plaques containing amyloid ss peptide and neurofibrillary tangles containing phospho-tau protein. Glutamate is the most abundant neurotransmitter in the brain and is essential to memory formation through processes such as long-term potentiation and so might be pivotal to Alzheimer disease progression. This review discusses how the glutamatergic system is impaired in Alzheimer disease and how interactions of amyloid ss and glutamate influence synaptic function, tau phosphorylation and neurodegeneration. Interestingly, glutamate not only influences amyloid ss production, but also amyloid ss can alter the levels of glutamate at the synapse, indicating that small changes in the concentrations of both molecules could influence Alzheimer disease progression. Finally, we describe how the glutamate receptor antagonist, memantine, has been used in the treatment of individuals with Alzheimer disease and discuss its effectiveness.",

AICD is the intracellular subdomain of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and able to bind the adapter protein FE65 and the histone acetyltransferase TIP60 setting up a nuclear dot-like phenotype. Within this work we readdressed the generation of the complex as a function of its compartments. Subsequently, we studied the proteome of AFT expressing cells vs. controls and identified Stathmin1 significantly down-regulated in AFT cells. Stathmin1 functions as an important regulatory protein of microtubule dynamics and was found associated with neurofibrillary tangles in brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. We validated our results using an independent label-free mass spectrometry based method using the same cell culture model. In a reversal model with diminished APP expression, caused by simultaneous knock-down of all three members of the APP family, we further confirmed our results, as Stathmin1 was regulated in an opposite fashion. We hypothesize that AICD-dependent deregulation of Stathmin1 causes microtubule disorganization, which might play an important role for the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.",

Isotope-assisted infrared vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) and absorption (VA) spectroscopy were used for the parent Abeta(25-35) peptide, along with doubly (13)C labeled peptides at the carbonyl groups of residues 29 (Gly) and 30 (Ala) [Abeta(25-35:(13)C-29/30)] and at the carbonyl groups of residues 33 (Gly) and 34 (Leu) [Abeta(25-35:(13)C-33/34)]. The present results confirm that Abeta(25-35) peptide fibrils adopt a beta-sheet structure and isotopic dilution experiments suggest a parallel beta-sheet structure. The isotopic shifts suggest that the microenvironment of residues 29 (Gly) and 30 (Ala) could be different from that of residues 33 (Gly) and 34 (Leu). An unusual enhancement for the amide II' VCD intensities of Abeta(25-35:(13)C-29/30) and Abeta(25-35:(13)C-33/34) peptide fibrils, considered to originate from inter-strand coupling, was found for the first time.

Recently, elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau protein levels have been reported to be associated with shorter survival in clinically diagnosed DLB. Correlations between CSF biomarkers and neuropathological findings in DLB are missing. The aim of this study was to investigate correlations between CSF biomarker levels and histopathological findings, with a focus on concomitant Alzheimer pathology, in neuropathologically verified DLB cases. METHODS: The extent of neurofibrillary pathology (Braak stage), neuritic plaques (CERAD stage), Alzheimer pathology (PPAD9 stage) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy was assessed in 16 cases with DLB in whom total tau (T-tau), hyperphosphorylated tau and amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta42) protein levels in CSF had been analyzed in vivo. Demographic and clinical data were collected. RESULTS: Both Braak and PPAD9 stages were inversely correlated with Abeta42 levels, whereas CERAD stage showed no significant correlations. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy correlated positively with T-tau and T-tau/Abeta42 ratio, and inversely with Abeta42 levels, but the group showed a very heterogeneous extent of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of concomitant Alzheimer pathology correlates with CSF Abeta42 but not with T-tau levels in cases with neuropathologically defined DLB.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, we examined the effects of intracerebroventricular administration of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase- (ERK) and p38-specific inhibitors, U0126 and PD169316, respectively, on apoptosis induced by amyloid beta (Abeta) in rats. To investigate the effects of these compounds, we evaluated intracellular signalling pathways of apoptosis, as well as inflammatory and antioxidant pathways, 7 and 20 days after Abeta injection. We found that caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, two hallmarks of apoptosis, were significantly decreased in the rats pre-treated with U0126 and PD169316, 7 days after Abeta injection. This observation was in agreement with the results of immunostaining analysis of the hippocampus that showed decreased levels of terminal transferase dUTP nick end labelling positive cells in the hippocampus of U0126 and PD169316 pre-treated rats, compared with the Abeta-injected group. We also chased the changes in the levels of calpain-2 and caspase-12, two ER factors, in the Abeta-injected and treatment groups. Decreased levels of calpain-2 and caspase-12 in U0126 and PD169316 pre-treated rats confirmed the protective effects of these inhibitors. Furthermore, we studied the effect of two stress-sensing transcription factors, nuclear-related factor-2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), in Abeta-injected as wells as U0126 and PD169316 pre-treated rats. U0126 and PD169316 activated Nrf2 and suppressed NF-kB pathways, 7 days after Abeta injection. These antioxidant and inflammatory pathways restored to the vehicle level within 20 days. Taken together, our findings reinforce and extend the notion of the potential neuroprotective role of ERK and/or p38 inhibitors against the neuronal toxicity induced by Abeta.",

    "title": "Leptin prevents hippocampal synaptic disruption and neuronal cell death induced by amyloid beta.",
    "abstract": "Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a key event mediating the cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as Abeta promotes synaptic dysfunction and triggers neuronal death. Recent evidence has linked the hormone leptin to AD as leptin levels are markedly attenuated in AD patients. Leptin is also a potential cognitive enhancer as it facilitates the cellular events underlying hippocampal learning and memory. Here we show that leptin prevents the detrimental effects of Abeta(1-42) on hippocampal long-term potentiation. Moreover leptin inhibits Abeta(1-42)-driven facilitation of long-term depression and internalization of the 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2- oxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit, GluR1, via activation of PI3-kinase. Leptin also protects cortical neurons from Abeta(1-42)-induced cell death by a signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3)-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, leptin inhibits Abeta(1-42)-mediated upregulation of endophilin I and phosphorylated tau in vitro, whereas cortical levels of endophilin I and phosphorylated tau are enhanced in leptin-insensitive Zucker fa/fa rats. Thus leptin benefits the functional characteristics and viability of neurons that degenerate in AD. These novel findings establish that the leptin system is an important therapeutic target in neurodegenerative conditions.",

This review article summarizes what is known regarding the synaptic synthesis, processing and function of APP and amyloid-beta (Abeta), as well as discusses how these proteins could contribute to the altered synaptic plasticity and pathology of the aforementioned disorders.

These peptides can self-assemble from monomers to higher oligomeric or fibrillar structures in a highly ordered and efficient manner. This self-assembly process is accompanied by a structural transition of the aggregated proteins from their normal fold into a predominantly beta-sheet secondary structure. 14ns molecular dynamics simulation revealed that fulvic acid interrupted the dimer formation of Abeta(17-42) peptide while in its absence Abeta(17-42) dimer formation occurred at ~12ns. Additionally, fulvic acid disrupted the preformed Abeta(17-42) trimer in a very short time interval (12ns). These results may provide an insight in the drug design against Abeta(17-42) peptide aggregation using fulvic acid as lead molecule against Abeta(17-42) mediated cytotoxicity and neurodegeneration.",

Recently, we found that Abeta with a toxic turn at positions 22 and 23 accumulates in neurons in AD brain. Here, we studied the accumulation of Abeta, toxic turn Abeta and high-molecular-weight Abeta oligomers in presenilin 1 (PS1) gene-transfected SH-SY5Y cells as well as in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice and AD patients. Immunostaining revealed that accumulation of toxic turn Abeta was promoted in G384A- and I143T-mutant PS1-transfected cells and further enhanced by co-transfection of cells with the Abeta-precursor protein (AbetaPP) gene. In contrast, accumulation of high-molecular-weight Abeta oligomers was promoted in mutant PS1 cells but attenuated by co-transfection of cells with the AbetaPP gene. Toxic turn Abeta was detected in the neurons of 3xTg-AD mice aged 2 months, when the mice were cognitively unimpaired. In contrast, high-molecular-weight Abeta oligomers were detected in the neurons of 7-month-old mice, when memory dysfunction is apparent. Furthermore, immunostaining and western blotting for Rab4, Rab6 and GRP78 revealed increased levels of these proteins in mutant PS1 cells and their accumulation in the neurons of 3xTg-AD mice. Remarkably, GRP78 immunoreactivity was increased at 2 months of age. Double-label immunostaining of AD brain revealed an apparent association between toxic turn Abeta and GRP78, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker. Intraneuronal accumulation of toxic turn Abeta may be associated with ER stress in the brains of AD model mice and AD patients at an early stage.",

    "title": "Werner coordination chemistry and neurodegeneration.",
    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are capturing the world's attention as being the next set of diseases we must tackle collectively. Not only are the patients experiencing gradual cognitive and physical decline in most cases, but these diseases are fatal with no prevention currently available. As these diseases are progressive, providing care and symptom treatment for the ageing population is becoming both a medical and a financial challenge. This review discusses how Werner coordination chemistry plays a role in three diseases - those of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and prions. Metal ions are considered to be involved in these diseases in part via their propensity to cause toxic aggregation of proteins. First, the coordination of metal ions, with emphasis on copper(II), to metalloproteins that are hallmarks of these diseases - amyloid beta, alpha-synuclein, and prion, respectively - will be discussed. We will present the current understanding of the metal coordination environments created by the amino acids of these proteins, as well as metal binding affinity. Second, a diverse set of examples of rationally designed metal chelators to outcompete this deleterious binding will be examined based on coordination mode and affinity toward bio-relevant metal ions. Overall, this review will give a general overview of protein and metal chelator coordination environments in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an aging disorder characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation in extracellular plaques and formation of intracellular tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau (p-Tau). Autophagic defects, leading to accumulation of autophagosomes, are recognized in AD. Parkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in degradation of proteins via autophagy and the proteasome. We investigated the role of parkin in postmortem brain tissues from 21 AD patients and 15 control subjects. We detected decreased parkin solubility in AD cortex and parkin co-localization with intraneuronal Abeta(1-42) in the hippocampus and cortex of AD patients. Parkin accumulation with intraneuronal Abeta and p-Tau was detected in autophagosomes in AD brains. To determine the role of parkin in Abeta clearance, we generated gene transfer animals expressing lentiviral Abeta(1-42)with and without parkin and examined autophagic mechanisms. Lentiviral expression of Abeta(1-42) led to p-Tau accumulation and induced autophagic defects, leading to accumulation of autophagic vacuoles. However, co-expression of wild type parkin facilitated autophagic clearance and promoted deposition of Abeta(1-42) and p-Tau into the lysosome. Taken together, these data suggest that Abeta(1-42) alters normal autophagy and parkin enhances autophagic clearance. In conclusion, decreased parkin solubility may lead to co-localization with intraneuronal Abeta(1-42) and compromise the cell autophagic clearance ability. Parkin may clear autophagic defects via autophagosome degradation.",

However, multiple nonmnemonic cognitive domains such as attention and executive control are also compromised early in AD individuals, but have not been routinely assessed in animal models. Here, we assessed the cognitive abilities of TgCRND8 mice-a widely used model of beta-amyloid pathology-with a touch screen-based automated test battery. The test battery comprises highly translatable tests of multiple cognitive constructs impaired in human AD, such as memory, attention, and response control, as well as appropriate control tasks. We found that familial AD mutations affect not only memory, but also cause significant alterations of sustained attention and behavioral flexibility. Because changes in attention and response inhibition may affect performance on tests of other cognitive abilities including memory, our findings have important consequences for the assessment of disease mechanisms and therapeutics in animal models of AD. A more comprehensive phenotyping with specialized, multicomponent cognitive test batteries for mice might significantly advance translation from preclinical mouse studies to the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Gene-targeting technology using mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells has become the \"gold standard\" for analyzing gene functions and producing disease models. Recently, genetically modified mice with multiple mutations have increasingly been produced to study the interaction between proteins and polygenic diseases. However, introduction of an additional mutation into mice already harboring several mutations by conventional natural crossbreeding is an extremely time- and labor-intensive process. Moreover, to do so in mice with a complex genetic background, several years may be required if the genetic background is to be retained. Establishing ES cells from multiple-mutant mice, or disease-model mice with a complex genetic background, would offer a possible solution. Here, we report the establishment and characterization of novel ES cell lines from a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD mouse, Oddo et al. in Neuron 39:409-421, 2003) harboring 3 mutated genes (APPswe, TauP301L, and PS1M146V) and a complex genetic background. Thirty blastocysts were cultured and 15 stable ES cell lines (male: 11; female: 4) obtained. By injecting these ES cells into diploid or tetraploid blastocysts, we generated germline-competent chimeras. Subsequently, we confirmed that F1 mice derived from these animals showed similar biochemical and behavioral characteristics to the original 3xTg-AD mice. Furthermore, we introduced a gene-targeting vector into the ES cells and successfully obtained gene-targeted ES cells, which were then used to generate knockout mice for the targeted gene. These results suggest that the present methodology is effective for introducing an additional mutation into mice already harboring multiple mutated genes and/or a complex genetic background.",

    "title": "A European multicentre PET study of fibrillar amyloid in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Amyloid PET tracers have been developed for in vivo detection of brain fibrillar amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD). To serve as an early biomarker in AD the amyloid PET tracers need to be analysed in multicentre clinical studies. METHODS: In this study 238 [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound-B (PIB) datasets from five different European centres were pooled. Of these 238 datasets, 18 were excluded, leaving [(11)C]PIB datasets from 97 patients with clinically diagnosed AD (mean age 69 +- 8 years), 72 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; mean age 67.5 +- 8 years) and 51 healthy controls (mean age 67.4 +- 6 years) available for analysis. Of the MCI patients, 64 were longitudinally followed for 28 +- 15 months. Most participants (175 out of 220) were also tested for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype. RESULTS: [(11)C]PIB retention in the neocortical and subcortical brain regions was significantly higher in AD patients than in age-matched controls. Intermediate [(11)C]PIB retention was observed in MCI patients, with a bimodal distribution (64 % MCI PIB-positive and 36 % MCI PIB-negative), which was significantly different the pattern in both the AD patients and controls. Higher [(11)C]PIB retention was observed in MCI ApoE epsilon4 carriers compared to non-ApoE epsilon4 carriers (p < 0.005). Of the MCI PIB-positive patients, 67 % had converted to AD at follow-up while none of the MCI PIB-negative patients converted. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the robustness of [(11)C]PIB PET as a marker of neocortical fibrillar amyloid deposition in brain when assessed in a multicentre setting. MCI PIB-positive patients showed more severe memory impairment than MCI PIB-negative patients and progressed to AD at an estimated rate of 25 % per year. None of the MCI PIB-negative patients converted to AD, and thus PIB negativity had a 100 % negative predictive value for progression to AD. This supports the notion that PIB-positive scans in MCI patients are an indicator of prodromal AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease hallmarked by extracellular Abeta(1-42) containing plaques, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Progressively, memory deficits and cognitive disabilities start to occur as these hallmarks affect hippocampus and frontal cortex, regions highly involved in memory. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression, which is high in the vicinity of Abeta plaques and NFTs, was found to influence gamma-secretase activity, the molecular crux in Abeta(1-42) production. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is an endogenous bile acid that downregulates CTGF expression in hepatocytes and has been shown to possess therapeutic efficacy in neurodegenerative models. To investigate the possible in vivo therapeutic effects of TUDCA, we provided 0.4% TUDCA-supplemented food to APP/PS1 mice, a well-established AD mouse model. Six months of TUDCA supplementation prevented the spatial, recognition and contextual memory defects observed in APP/PS1 mice at 8 months of age. Furthermore, TUDCA-supplemented APP/PS1 mice displayed reduced hippocampal and prefrontal amyloid deposition. These effects of TUDCA supplementation suggest a novel mechanistic route for Alzheimer therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of Alzheimer's disease is thought to be linked to interactions between amyloid-beta (Abeta) and neural cell membranes, causing membrane disruption and increased ion conductance. The effects of Abeta on lipid behavior have been characterized experimentally, but structural and causal details are lacking. We used atomistic molecular dynamics simulations totaling over 6 mus in simulation time to investigate the behavior of Abeta(42) in zwitterionic and anionic lipid bilayers. We simulated transmembrane beta-sheets (monomer and tetramer) resulting from a global optimization study and a helical structure obtained from an NMR study. In all simulations Abeta(42) remained embedded in the bilayer. It was found that the surface charge and the lipid tail type are determinants for transmembrane stability of Abeta(42) with zwitterionic surfaces and unsaturated lipids promoting stability. From the considered structures, the beta-sheet tetramer is most stable as a result of interpeptide interactions. We performed an in-depth analysis of the translocation of water in the Abeta(42)-bilayer systems. We observed that this process is generally fast (within a few nanoseconds) yet generally slower than in the peptide-free bilayers. It is mainly governed by the lipid type, simulation temperature and Abeta(42) conformation. The rate limiting step is the permeation through the hydrophobic core, where interactions between Abeta(42) and permeating H(2)O molecules slow the translocation process. The beta-sheet tetramer allows more water molecules to pass through the bilayer compared to monomeric Abeta, allowing us to conclude that the experimentally observed permeabilization of membranes must be due to membrane-bound Abeta oligomers, and not monomers.",

However, the mechanisms of BACE1 accumulation in Alzheimer's disease are largely unknown. In this report, we found that small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-1 interacts with the dileucine motif of BACE1 and regulates the level of BACE1 protein. This was proved by the coimmunoprecipitation, and gain or loss of function experiments. Altering 3 SUMO isoforms affects BACE1 protein levels, and consequently results in altered amyloid precursor protein processing and Abeta generation. BACE1 levels were increased in response to Abeta or apoptosis, but not in cells lacking SUMO1. Abeta increased SUMO1 protein levels in rat cortical neurons. Moreover, SUMO1 immunoreactivity was increased in the amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. Furthermore, the C-terminus fragments of BACE1 containing dileucine motif reduced Abeta generation by SUMO1 overexpression. Our study indicates SUMO1 is not only a novel and potent regulator of BACE1 accumulation and Abeta generation but also a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to describe the attitudes of U.S. neurologists specializing in dementia toward the use of amyloid imaging in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A cross-sectional electronic physician survey of dementia specialists at U.S. medical schools was performed. The response rate for the survey was 51.9% (135/260). Greater than 83% of respondents plan to use amyloid imaging to evaluate patients for AD. Most respondents intend to use amyloid imaging as an adjunctive diagnostic modality to confirm (77%) or rule-out (73%) a diagnosis of AD; 24% plan to use amyloid imaging to screen asymptomatic individuals for evidence of cerebral amyloid. Specialists who do not intend to use amyloid imaging (16%) express concern about the cost (73%), the usefulness (55%), and likelihood of patient (55%) and clinician (59%) misinterpretation of findings. The need for patient pre-test counseling was endorsed by a large percentage (92%) of dementia specialists (higher than for genetic testing (82%)). In conclusion, dementia specialists, particularly young specialists, are likely to be early adopters of amyloid imaging. Assuming ready availability, this new technology would be used as a confirmatory test in the evaluation of AD, as well as a screening tool for asymptomatic pathology. Specialists recognize the complexity of interpreting amyloid imaging findings and the need for patient counseling before undergoing testing.",

We explored the associations between plasma Abeta(40), Abeta(42), and truncated Abeta levels, and prognosis of dementia in participants of the prospective 3-City Study. 120 aged individuals diagnosed with 2-year incident dementia were followed up for seven years. The associations between Abeta plasma levels and baseline cognitive score, cognitive decline, and death were examined. A higher level of baseline plasma Abeta was associated with worse cognitive status two years prior to incident dementia diagnosis. In incident AD patients, the association was only significant for Abeta(40) and Abeta(n-42). In the fast cognitive decliners group, especially in AD cases, a higher level of 5 pg/ml of baseline Abeta(42), Abeta(n-42), Abeta(n-42)/Abeta(n-40), and Abeta(42)/Abeta(40) ratios were associated with a lower risk of fast cognitive decline based on the Isaacs Set Test score. There was no association between peptide levels and mortality in demented subjects. When assayed at prodromal stage, plasma Abeta levels may be potentially useful markers of fast cognitive decline in individuals who subsequently become demented.",

    "title": "3xTg-AD mice exhibit an activated central stress axis during early-stage pathology.",
    "abstract": "Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis occurs in response to the organism's innate need for homeostasis. The glucocorticoids (GCs) that are released into the circulation upon acute activation of the HPA axis perform stress-adaptive functions and provide negative feedback to turn off the HPA axis, but can be detrimental when in excess. Long-term activation of the HPA axis (such as with chronic stress) enhances susceptibility to neuronal dysfunction and death, and increases vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known how components of the HPA axis, upstream of GCs, impact vulnerability to AD. This study examined basal gene expression of stress-related molecules in brains of 3xTg-AD mice during early-stage pathology. Basal GC levels and mRNA expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and corticotropic releasing hormone (CRH) in several stress- and emotionality-related brain regions were measured in 3-4-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. Despite normal GC levels, young 3xTg-AD mice exhibit an activated central HPA axis, with altered mRNA levels of MR and GR in the hippocampus, GR and CRH in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, GR and CRH in the central nucleus of the amygdala, and CRH in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. This HPA axis activation is present during early-stage neuropathology when 3xTg-AD mice show mild behavioral changes, suggesting an ongoing neuroendocrine regulation that precedes the onset of severe AD-like pathology and behavioral deficits.",

We show here the generation of a set of highly potent VEGF-A antagonistic DARPins (designed ankyrin repeat proteins) delivering these properties. DARPins with single-digit picomolar affinity to human VEGF-A were generated using ribosome display selections. Specific and potent human VEGF-A binding was confirmed by ELISA and endothelial cell sprouting assays. Cross-reactivity with VEGF-A of several species was confirmed by ELISA. Intravitreally injected DARPin penetrated into the retina and reduced fluorescein extravasation in a rabbit model of vascular leakage. In addition, topical DARPin application was found to diminish corneal neovascularization in a rabbit suture model, and to suppress laser-induced neovascularization in a rat model. Even at elevated doses, DARPins were safe to use. The fact that several DARPins are highly active in various assays illustrates the favorable class behavior of the selected binders. Anti-VEGF-A DARPins thus represent a novel class of highly potent and specific drug candidates for the treatment of neovascular eye diseases in both the posterior and the anterior eye chamber.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of epidemiological evidence suggests that fruit and vegetable juices containing various phenolic compounds can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As the altered amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing leading to increased beta-amyloid (Abeta) production is a key pathogenic feature of AD, we elucidated the effects of different polyphenols on neuroprotection and APP processing under different in vitro stress conditions. The effects of these compounds were also investigated in transgenic AD mice (APdE9). Free radical toxicity and apoptosis were induced in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells overexpressing APP751. Menadione-induced production of reactive oxygen species was significantly decreased upon treatment with myricetin, quercetin or anthocyanin-rich extracts in a dose-dependent manner. However, these extracts did not affect caspase-3 activation, APP processing or Abeta levels upon staurosporine-induced apoptosis. APdE9 mice fed with anthocyanin-rich bilberry or blackcurrant extracts showed decreased APP C-terminal fragment levels in the cerebral cortex as compared to APdE9 mice on the control diet. Soluble Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels were significantly decreased in bilberry-fed mice as compared to blackcurrant-fed mice. Conversely, the ratio of insoluble Abeta42/40 was significantly decreased in blackcurrant-fed mice relative to bilberry-fed mice. Both berry diets alleviated the spatial working memory deficit of aged APdE9 mice as compared to mice on the control diet. There were no changes in the expression or phosphorylation status of tau in APdE9 mice with respect to diet. These data suggest that anthocyanin-rich bilberry and blackcurrant diets favorably modulate APP processing and alleviate behavioral abnormalities in a mouse model of AD.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Depression may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have shown modifications in blood beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels in depressed patients. This literature review examines the potential relationship between Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity and pathophysiology of mood disorders. DESIGN: We conducted a review of the literature focusing on recent studies reporting alterations of plasma and serum Abeta peptides levels in patients suffering from mood disorders. RESULTS: Different data suggest that patients with mood disorders are at great risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia. In particular, low plasma levels of Abeta42 peptide and a high Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio have been found in depressed patients. In addition, changes in Abeta protein levels in patients with mood disorders have been associated with the severity of cognitive impairment and correlated positively with the number of episodes and severity of illness course. CONCLUSIONS: Given the intriguing association between change in plasma level of Abeta, depression and cognitive impairment, future work should focus on the relationship between Abeta peripheral level(s), biomarkers of neurodegeneration and development of dementia in patients affected by mood disorders.",

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the wide range of changes includes impaired function of key secretory peptidic cargos such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neuropeptides. Here, we analyzed CPE and SgIII in the cerebral cortex of AD patients and transgenic mice. In the normal human cortex, a preferential location in dendrites and perikarya was observed for CPE, whereas SgIII was mainly associated with axons and terminal-like buttons. Interestingly, SgIII and CPE were consistently detected in astroglial cell bodies and thin processes. In AD cortices, a strong wide accumulation of both sorting receptors was detected in dystrophic neurites surrounding amyloid plaques. Occasionally, increased levels of SgIII were also observed in plaque associate-reactive astrocytes. Of note, the main alterations detected for CPE and SgIII in AD patients were faithfully recapitulated by APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. These results implicate for the first time the sorting receptors for regulated secretion in amyloid beta-associated neural degeneration. Because CPE and SgIII are essential in the process and targeting of neuropeptides and neurotrophins, their participation in the pathological progression of AD may be suggested.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is responsible for the deficits of learning and memory in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The high affinity between Abeta and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) suggests that the impairment of cognitive function in AD might be involved in the Abeta-induced damage of nAChRs. This study investigated the effects of Abeta fragments on nAChR-mediated membrane currents in acutely isolated rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons by using whole-cell patch clamp technique. The results showed that: (1) nonspecific nAChR agonist nicotine, selective alpha7 nAChR agonist choline, and alpha4beta2 nAChR agonist epibatidine all effectively evoked inward currents in CA1 neurons at normal resting membrane potential, with different desensitization characteristics; (2) acute application of different concentrations (pM-muM) of Abeta25-35, Abeta31-35, or Abeta35-31 alone did not trigger any membrane current, but pretreatment with 1 muM Abeta25-35 and Abeta31-35 similarly and reversibly suppressed the nicotine-induced currents; (3) further, choline- and epibatidine-induced currents were also reversibly suppressed by the Abeta pretreatment, but more prominent for the choline-induced response. These results demonstrate that the functional activity of both alpha7 and alpha4beta2 nAChRs in the membrane of acutely isolated hippocampal neurons was significantly downregulated by Abeta treatment, suggesting that nAChRs, especially alpha7 nAChRs, in the brain may be the important biological targets of neurotoxic Abeta in AD. In addition, the similar suppression of nAChR currents by Abeta25-35 and Abeta31-35 suggests that the sequence 31-35 in Abeta molecule may be a shorter active center responsible for the neurotoxicity of Abeta in AD.",

    "abstract": "Although transplanted pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons can contribute to functional recovery in animal models of Parkinson's disease, the risk of tumor formation hinders clinical applications of this approach. Removing undifferentiated cells from the donor population is critical to reduce tumorigenesis. Moreover, immature neural progenitors in transplants can proliferate unpredictably, resulting in neural overgrowth and long-term risks of compressing the surrounding host tissue. Because Notch signaling plays a role in maintaining the multipotency and proliferative capacity of neural progenitors, we used gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) to dampen Notch signaling in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitors before transplantation and examined the effects on the growth of proliferative grafts. We observed a marked reduction in the percentage of dividing cells and increased neuronal maturation in GSI-treated samples in vitro. Next, grafts were transplanted into the striata of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immune deficiency mice. Histological analyses performed 8 weeks after the operation showed that grafts pretreated with GSIs--N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester or compound E--were significantly smaller than control samples. Immunohistologic analyses revealed that briefly treating the donor population with GSIs not only reduced the graft volume, but also altered the composition of the graft; control grafts showed neural overgrowth with numerous PAX6+ and Ki67+ neural rosettes, whereas GSI-treated samples developed into mature neuronal grafts containing primarily Tubbeta3+ cells. These results suggest that pretreating potentially proliferative progenitors with GSIs may improve the safety of cell replacement therapies using pluripotent stem cells.",

    "abstract": "For over a decade, it has been known that amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides of Alzheimer's disease bind to the nicotinic alpha7 acetylcholine receptor (AChR) with picomolar affinity, and that snake alpha-neurotoxins competitively inhibit this binding. Here we propose a model of the binding mechanism of Abeta peptides to alpha7-AChR at atomic level. The binding mechanism is based on sequence and structure similarities of Abeta residues with functional residues of snake alpha-neurotoxins (ATX) in complex with AChR. The binding mechanism involves residue (Abeta)K28 (similar to (ATX)R32) which forms cation/pi interactions in the acetylcholine binding site, and residues (Abeta)G29-(Abeta)I32 [GAII] (similar to (ATX)G33-(ATX)I36 [GTII]) which form an intermolecular beta-sheet with residues (alpha7)F189-(alpha7)E191 of AChR. Through these interactions, we propose that the AChR serves as a chaperone for Abeta conformational changes from alpha- to beta-hairpin. The interactions which block channel opening provide fundamental insight into Abeta neurotoxicity and cognition impairment, that could contribute to pathogenic processes in Alzheimer's disease, thus paving the way for structure based therapies.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The rs3818361 single nucleotide polymorphism in complement component (3b/4b) receptor-1 (CR1) is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although this novel variant is associated with a small effect size and is unlikely to be useful as a predictor of AD risk, it might provide insights into AD pathogenesis. We examined the association between rs3818361 and brain amyloid deposition in nondemented older individuals. METHODS: We used (11)C-Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography to quantify brain amyloid burden in 57 nondemented older individuals (mean age 78.5 years) in the neuroimaging substudy of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. In a replication study, we analyzed (11)C-Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography data from 22 cognitively normal older individuals (mean age 77.1 years) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. RESULTS: Risk allele carriers of rs3818361 have lower brain amyloid burden relative to noncarriers. There is a strikingly greater variability in brain amyloid deposition in the noncarrier group relative to risk carriers, an effect explained partly by APOE genotype. In noncarriers of the CR1 risk allele, APOE epsilon4 individuals showed significantly higher brain amyloid burden relative to APOE epsilon4 noncarriers. We also independently replicate our observation of lower brain amyloid burden in risk allele carriers of rs3818361 in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative sample. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest complex mechanisms underlying the interaction of CR1, APOE, and brain amyloid pathways in AD. Our results are relevant to treatments targeting brain Abeta in nondemented individuals at risk for AD and suggest that clinical outcomes of such treatments might be influenced by complex gene-gene interactions.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects neurons and glial cells and leads to dementia. Growing evidence shows that glial changes may precede neuronal alterations and behavioral impairment in the progression of the disease. The modulation of these changes could be addressed as a potential therapeutic strategy. Environmental enrichment has been classically associated to effects on neuronal morphology and function but less attention has been paid to the modulation of glia. We thus characterized astroglial changes in the hippocampus of adult PDAPP-J20 transgenic mice, a model of AD, exposed for 3 months to an enriched environment, from 5 to 8 months of age. Using confocal microscopy, three-dimensional reconstruction and Sholl analysis, we evaluated the morphology of two distinct populations of astrocytes: those associated to amyloid beta plaques and those that were not. We found that plaque-associated astrocytes in PDAPP-J20 mice had an increased volume and process ramification than control astrocytes. Non-plaque-associated astrocytes showed a decrease in volume and an increase in the ramification of GFAP+ processes as compared with control astrocytes. Environmental enrichment prevented these alterations and promoted a cellular morphology similar to that found in control mice. Morphological changes in non-plaque-associated astrocytes were found also at 5 months of age, before amyloid beta deposition in the hippocampus. These results suggest that glial alterations have an early onset in AD pathogenesis and that the exposure to an enriched environment is an appropriate strategy to reverse them. Cellular and molecular pathways involved in this regulation could constitute potential novel therapeutic targets.",

We identified 4 different proteomic signatures, each using 5 to 14 analytes, that differentiate AD from control patients with sensitivity and specificity ranging from 74% to 85%. Five analytes were common to all 4 signatures: apolipoprotein A-II, apolipoprotein E, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, alpha-1-microglobulin, and brain natriuretic peptide. None of the signatures adequately predicted progression from MCI to AD over a 12- and 24-month period. A new panel of analytes, optimized to predict MCI to AD conversion, was able to provide 55% to 60% predictive accuracy.

    "abstract": "The entorhinal cortex (EC) is one of the most vulnerable brain regions that is affected by beta amyloid (Abeta) in the early phases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Calcium dyshomeostasis is one reason of Abeta pathology and the role of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in this phenomenon has not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the possible neuroprotective effect of CCBs, nimodipine and isradipine against amyloid pathogenesis in EC. The Abeta 1-42 was injected bilaterally into the EC of male rats and spatial performance was assessed between 7 and 12 days after Abeta injection by Morris water maze test. Animals were daily treated by injection of various doses of nimodipine or isradipine (both at 3, 10, or 30 mug/2 mul) or their vehicles into the lateral ventricle until the start of behavioral test. Lesion in EC was assessed by measuring some proteinases involved in calcium dependent apoptotic pathway (calpain 2, caspase 12 and 3). Despite normal performance in probe test, Abeta treated rats showed delayed acquisition in a spatial reference memory task. Abeta treated rats revealed delayed acquisition in reversal memory and had deficit in probe test. The observed impairments were attenuated by isradipine (10 and 30 mug but not 3 mug) and nimodipine (30 mug). Calpain 2, caspase 12 and 3 were increased in the Abeta treated animals which was partially antagonized by isradipine and nimodipine. It is concluded that CCBs might have beneficial therapeutic effects in AD especially in the early phases of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Prevention of amyloidosis by chemical compounds is a potential therapeutic strategy in Alzheimer's, prion and other neurodegenerative diseases. Regularly branched dendrimers and less regular hyperbranched polymers have been suggested as promising inhibitors of amyloid aggregation. As demonstrated in our previous studies, some widely used dendrimers (PAMAM, PPI) could not only inhibit amyloid aggregation in solution but also dissolve mature fibrils. In this study we have performed computer simulation of polylysine dendrimers of 3rd and 5th generations (D3 and D5) and analysed the effect of these dendrimers and some hyperbranched polymers on a lysine base (HpbK) on aggregation of amyloid peptide in solution. The effects of dendrimers on cell viability and their protective action against Abeta-induced cytotoxicity and alteration of K+channels was also analysed using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, using fluorescence microscopy, we analysed uptake of FITC-conjugated D3 by SH-SY5Y cells and its distribution in the brain after intraventricular injections to rats. Our results demonstrated that dendrimers D3 and D5 inhibited amyloid aggregation in solution while HpbK enhanced amyloid aggregation. Cell viability and patch-clamp studies have shown that D3 can protect cells against Abeta-induced cytotoxicity and K+channel modulation. In contrast, HpbK had no protective effect against Abeta. Fluorescence microscopy studies demonstrated that FITC-D3 accumulates in the vacuolar compartments of the cells and can be detected in various brain structures and populations of cells after injections to the brain. As such, polylysine dendrimers D3 and D5 can be proposed as compounds for developing antiamyloidogenic drugs.",

    "abstract": "The current treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is purely symptomatic, but medications interfering with underlying pathophysiological processes are being developed. To evaluate a possible disease-modifying effect, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers with a direct link to the underlying pathophysiology, such as amyloid-beta(1-42) (Abeta(1-42)), total tau protein (T-tau), and hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau(181P)), may play an important role. If intra-individual fluctuations in biomarker levels are small, the difference between two samples could serve as a pharmacodynamic measure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the longitudinal stability of CSF Abeta(1-42), T-tau, and P-tau(181P) levels in AD patients and control subjects. Serial CSF samples of 28 AD patients and 23 controls with a minimum time interval of 30 days were included in this study. Serial CSF samples from 10 progressive patients (7 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and 3 controls progressing to MCI or AD) were also analyzed. Intra-individual CSF Abeta(1-42) and P-tau(181P) levels were stable in AD and controls. Intra-individual CSF T-tau levels differed significantly in AD patients, but not in controls. Change in biomarker concentrations per time unit was also significant between groups, but not within groups. The difference in biomarker levels in samples from progressive patients was not significant. In conclusion, CSF levels of Abeta(1-42), T-tau, and P-tau(181P) are relatively stable over time. Only T-tau increased in AD patients in comparison to controls, which does not preclude its use as a diagnostic marker, nor as a potential pharmacodynamic marker.",

    "title": "Episodic-like memory for what-where-which occasion is selectively impaired in the 3xTgAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Episodic memory loss is a defining feature of early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). A test of episodic-like memory for the rat, the What-Where-Which occasion task (WWWhich), requires the association of object, location, and contextual information to form an integrated memory for an event. The WWWhich task cannot be solved by use of non-episodic information such as object familiarity and is dependent on hippocampal integrity. Thus, it provides an ideal tool with which to test capacity for episodic-like memory in the 3xTg murine model for AD. As this model captures much of the human AD phenotype, we hypothesized that these mice would show a deficit in the WWWhich episodic-like memory task. To test the specificity of any episodic-like deficit, we also examined whether mice could perform components of the WWWhich task that do not require episodic-like memory. These included object (Novel Object Recognition), location (Object Location Task, What-Where task), and contextual (What-Which) memory, as well as another three-component task that can be solved without reliance on episodic recall (What-Where-When; WWWhen). The results demonstrate for the first time that control 129sv/c57bl6 mice could form WWWhich episodic-like memories, whereas, 3xTgAD mice at 6 months of age were impaired. Importantly, while 3xTgAD mice showed some deficit on spatial component tasks, they were unimpaired in the more complex WWWhen combination task (which includes a spatial component and is open to non-episodic solutions). These results strongly suggest that AD pathology centered on the hippocampal formation mediates a specific deficit for WWWhich episodic-like memory in the 3xTgAD model.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy has the potential to provide a possible treatment therapy to prevent or delay Alzheimer disease. In a clinical trial (AN1792) in which patients received this immunotherapy and received active Abeta1-42 peptide immunizations, treatment was stopped when 6% of patients showed signs of meningoencephalitis. Follow up on these patients led to the conclusion that the antibody response was beneficial in removing Abeta1-42 from brain but an accompanying inflammatory Th1 T cell response was harmful. As a safe alternative treatment targeting the same self protein, Abeta1-42, in brain, we and others are working on a DNA Abeta1-42 immunization protocol as the immune response to DNA immunizations differs in many aspects from immunizations with peptide antigens. Because the immune response to DNA vaccination has different kinetics and has a significantly lower antibody production, we evaluated two different prime boost regimens, Abeta1-42 DNA prime/Abeta1-42 peptide boost and Abeta1-42 peptide prime/Abeta1-42 DNA boost for their effectiveness in antibody production and possible side effects due to inflammatory T cell responses. While both boost regimes significantly enhanced the specific antibody production with comparable antibody concentrations, the absence of the Abeta1-42 T cell response (no proliferation and no cytokine production) is consistent with our previous findings using this DNA Abeta1-42 trimer immunization and greatly enhances the safety aspect for possible clinical use.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the leading neurodegenerative disorders of older adults, which causes major socioeconomic burdens globally, lacks effective therapeutics without significant side effects. Besides the hallmark pathology of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), it has been reported that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a critical neuronal kinase, is hyperactivated in AD brains and is, in part, responsible for the above pathology. Here we show that a modified truncated 24-aa peptide (TFP5), derived from the Cdk5 activator p35, penetrates the blood-brain barrier after intraperitoneal injections, inhibits abnormal Cdk5 hyperactivity, and significantly rescues AD pathology (up to 70-80%) in 5XFAD AD model mice. The mutant mice, injected with TFP5 exhibit behavioral rescue, whereas no rescue was observed in mutant mice injected with either saline or scrambled peptide. However, TFP5 does not inhibit cell cycle Cdks or normal Cdk5/p35 activity, and thereby has no toxic side effects (even at 200 mg/kg), a common problem in most current therapeutics for AD. In addition, treated mice displayed decreased inflammation, amyloid plaques, NFTs, cell death, and an extended life by 2 mo. These results suggest TFP5 as a potential therapeutic, toxicity-free candidate for AD.",

Over the past years, transgenic mouse models have been generated to recapitulate the main features of this disease, including cognitive impairments. This study investigates frontal cortex dependent learning abilities in one of the most early-onset transgenic murine model of AD, the 5XFAD mice. We compared frontal performance of 2-, 4-, and 6-month-old 5XFAD mice with their wild-type littermates using a newly developed automated device, the olfactory H-maze, in which mice have to discover three different rules consecutively according to the delayed reaction paradigm. We report early cognitive deficits related to frontal cortex appearing in 4-month-old 5XFAD mice before hippocampal-dependent learning and memory impairment, in relation with neuropathologic processes such as strong gliosis and emerging amyloid plaques. The present results demonstrate that the olfactory H-maze is a very sensitive and simple experimental paradigm that allows assessment of frontal functions in transgenic mice and should be useful to test pre-clinical therapeutic approaches to alter the course of AD.",

Locus coeruleus is the brain stem nucleus responsible for synthesis of noradrenaline and from where all noradrenergic neurons project. In addition, it has been suggested that noradrenaline might play a role in modulating inflammatory responses in Alzheimer's disease. In this study we aimed to investigate the effect of various agonists and antagonists for adrenergic receptors on amyloid precursor protein processing. Among them, we found that prazosin, an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, was able to reduce the generation of amyloid beta in N2a cells. Treatment of transgenic APP23 mice with prazosin prevented memory deficits over time. Although prazosin did not influence amyloid plaque load, it induced astrocytic proliferation and increased the release of apolipoprotein E and anti-inflammatory cytokines. These findings suggest that chronic treatment with prazosin leads to an anti-inflammatory response with potential beneficial effects on cognitive performance.",

    "abstract": "Deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) containing plaques in the brain is one of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been suggested that modulation of neuronal activity may alter Abeta production in the brain. We postulate that these changes in Abeta production are due to changes in the rate-limiting step of Abeta generation, APP cleavage by gamma-secretase. By combining biochemical approaches with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, we found that neuronal inhibition decreases endogenous APP and PS1 interactions, which correlates with reduced Abeta production. By contrast, neuronal activation had a two-phase effect: it initially enhanced APP-PS1 interaction leading to increased Abeta production, which followed by a decrease in the APP and PS1 proximity/interaction. Accordingly, treatment of neurons with naturally secreted Abeta isolated from AD brain or with synthetic Abeta resulted in reduced APP and PS1 proximity. Moreover, applying low concentration of Abeta(42) to cultured neurons inhibited de novo Abeta synthesis. These data provide evidence that neuronal activity regulates endogenous APP-PS1 interactions, and suggest a model of a product-enzyme negative feedback. Thus, under normal physiological conditions Abeta may impact its own production by modifying gamma-secretase cleavage of APP. Disruption of this negative modulation may cause Abeta overproduction leading to neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides are intensely studied in neuroscience and their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements may be used to track the metabolic pathways of APP in vivo. Reduced CSF levels of Abeta and soluble APP (sAPP) fragments are reported in inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS); but in MS, the precise pathway of APP metabolism and whether it can be affected by disease-modifying treatments remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the CSF biomarkers of APP degradation in MS, including the effects of disease-modifying therapy. METHODS: CSF samples from 87 MS patients (54 relapsing-remitting (RR) MS; 33 secondary progressive (SP) MS and 28 controls were analyzed for sAPP and Abeta peptides by immunoassays, plus a subset of samples was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (IP-MS). Patients treated with natalizumab or mitoxantrone were examined at baseline, and after 1-2 years of treatment. RESULTS: CSF sAPP and Abeta peptide levels were reduced in MS patients; but they increased again towards normal, after natalizumab treatment. A multivariate model of IP-MS-measured Abeta species separated the SPMS patients from controls, with RRMS patients having intermediate levels. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed and extended our previous observations of altered CSF sAPP and Abeta peptide levels in MS patients. We found that natalizumab therapy may be able to counteract the altered APP metabolism in MS. The CSF Abeta isoform distribution was found to be distinct in SPMS patients, as compared to the controls.",

Previously, we have identified the presynaptic protein Munc13-1 as a diacylglycerol/phorbolester (DAG/PE) receptor that contributes to secretory, non-amyloidogenic APP processing after PE stimulation. Here, we used organotypic brain slice cultures from wild-type mice and from Munc13-1 knock-out (KO), Munc13-2 KO and Munc13-1/2 double KO (DKO) mice for pharmacological stimulation experiments. First, we demonstrate that neuronal populations and synaptic components important for secretory APP processing develop normally in organotypic brain slice cultures of all genotypes analyzed. Blockade of voltage-gated Na(+) channels by tetrodotoxin reduced the PE-stimulated secretory APP processing, whereas depolarization by high extracellular K(+) concentration evoked APP secretion. Additionally, the PE-stimulated APP secretion from Munc13-1 KO brain slices was significantly lower than that from wild-type brain slices. This effect was not observed in brain slices from Munc13-2 KO mice, which is consistent with the lower abundance and subpopulation-specific distribution of Munc13-2 in presynaptic elements. In Munc13-1/2 DKO brain slices, the deficiency of Munc13-1 dominated the effect of APP processing. The Munc13-1 KO effect on APP processing could be rescued by the stimulation of postsynaptic glutamatergic receptors. This indicates that lack of postsynaptic glutamate receptor stimulation in Munc13-1 KO brain slice cultures but not presynaptic mechanisms account for compromised APP processing. We conclude that organotypic brain slices cultures are a valuable tool for studying APP processing pathways in intact neuronal circuits and that neuronal activity is important for maintenance of the non-amyloidogenic APP processing.",

    "title": "Protection against the synaptic targeting and toxicity of Alzheimer's-associated Abeta oligomers by insulin mimetic chiro-inositols.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive dementia that correlates highly with synapse loss. This loss appears due to the synaptic accumulation of toxic Abeta oligomers (ADDLs), which damages synapse structure and function. Although it has been reported that oligomer binding and toxicity can be prevented by stimulation of neuronal insulin signaling with PPARgamma agonists, these agonists have problematic side effects. We therefore investigated the therapeutic potential of chiro-inositols, insulin-sensitizing compounds safe for human consumption. Chiro-inositols have been studied extensively for treatment of diseases associated with peripheral insulin resistance, but their insulin mimetic function in memory-relevant central nervous system (CNS) cells is unknown. Here we demonstrate that mature cultures of hippocampal neurons respond to d-chiro-inositol (DCI), pinitol (3-O-methyl DCI), and the inositol glycan INS-2 (pinitol beta-1-4 galactosamine) with increased phosphorylation in key upstream components in the insulin-signaling pathway (insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate-1, and Akt). Consistent with insulin stimulation, DCI treatment promotes rapid withdrawal of dendritic insulin receptors. With respect to neuroprotection, DCI greatly enhances the ability of insulin to prevent ADDL-induced synapse damage (EC(50) of 90 nM). The mechanism comprises inhibition of oligomer binding at synapses and requires insulin/IGF signaling. DCI showed no effects on Abeta oligomerization. We propose that inositol glycans and DCI, a compound already established as safe for human consumption, have potential as AD therapeutics by protecting CNS synapses against Abeta oligomers through their insulin mimetic activity.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are increasingly used in research centers, clinical trials, and clinical settings. However, their broad-scale use is hampered by lack of standardization across analytical platforms and by interference from binding of amyloid-beta (Abeta) to matrix proteins as well as self-aggregation. Here, we report on a matrix effect-resistant method for the measurement of the AD-associated 42 amino acid species of Abeta (Abeta42), together with Abeta40 and Abeta38 in human CSF based on mass spectrometric quantification using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Samples were prepared by solid-phase extraction and quantification was performed using stable-isotope labeled Abeta peptides as internal standards. The diagnostic performance of the method was evaluated on two independent clinical materials with research volunteers who were cognitively normal and AD patients with mild to moderate dementia. Analytical characteristics of the method include a lower limit of quantification of 62.5 pg/mL for Abeta42 and coefficients of variations below 10%. In a pilot study on AD patients and controls, we verified disease-association with decreased levels of Abeta42 similar to that obtained by ELISA and even better separation was obtained using the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio. The developed assay is sensitive and is not influenced by matrix effects, enabling absolute quantification of Abeta42, Abeta40, and Abeta38 in CSF, while it retains the ability to distinguish AD patients from controls. We suggest this SRM-based method for Abeta peptide quantification in human CSF valuable for clinical research and trials.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation and cytotoxicity of Abeta with redox-active metals in neuronal cells have been implicated in the progression of Alzheimer disease. Human metallothionein (MT) 3 is highly expressed in the normal human brain and is downregulated in Alzheimer disease. Zn(7)MT3 can protect against the neuronal toxicity of Abeta by preventing copper-mediated Abeta aggregation, abolishing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the related cellular toxicity. In this study, we intended to decipher the roles of single-domain proteins (alpha/beta) and the alpha-beta domain-domain interaction of Zn(7)MT3 to determine the molecular mechanism for protection against the neuronal cytotoxicity of Abeta(1-42) with copper ions. With this in mind, the alpha and beta single-domain proteins, heterozygous beta(MT3)-alpha(MT1), and a linker-truncated mutant  31-34 were prepared and characterized. In the presence/absence of various Zn(7)MT3 proteins, the Abeta(1-42)-Cu(2+)-mediated aggregation, the production of ROS, and the cellular toxicity were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, ROS assay by means of a fluorescent probe, and SH-SY5Y cell viability, respectively. The beta domain cannot abolish Abeta(1-42)-Cu(2+)-induced aggregation, and neither the beta domain nor the alpha domain can quench the production of ROS because of the redox cycling of Abeta-Cu(2+). Similarly to wild-type Zn(7)MT3, the heterozygous beta(MT3)-alpha(MT1) possesses the characteristic of alleviating Abeta(1-42) aggregation and oxidative stress to neuronal cells. Therefore, the two domains through the linker Lys-Lys-Ser form a cooperative unit, and each of them is indispensable in conducting its bioactivity. The alpha domain plays an important role in modulating the stability of the metal-thiolate cluster, and the alpha-beta domain-domain interaction through the linker is critical for its protective role in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Dimebon belongs to a fast-growing group of \"old\" drugs that were suggested to be effective for therapy of pathological conditions different from their original targets. Following initial reports of successful Phase II clinical trials for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, effects of Dimebon on various neurodegenerative conditions were investigated both in follow-up clinical trials and in various model systems. Although results of Phase III clinical trials carried out so far were disappointing, there is growing body of evidence that this drug can affect neuronal physiology in a way that would be beneficial at particular stages of development of certain types of neurodegeneration. To reveal what molecular and cellular pathological processes might be affected by Dimebon, we tested the ability of this drug to ameliorate pathology in model systems recapitulating particular pathogenic mechanisms involved in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we assessed the ability of Dimebon to modify several prominent features of tauopathies using transgenic tauP301S mice as a model. Chronic treatment with Dimebon was found to partially protect against the progressive decline in motor function and accumulation of tau-positive dystrophic neurons characteristic of tauP301S mice. Similar results were obtained with two further gamma-carbolines structurally similar to Dimebon. Our data suggest that Dimebon and Dimebon-like compounds might be considered as drugs possessing disease-modifying activity for diseases with prominent tau pathology.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Extensive deposition of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although several PET imaging agents have been developed for in vivo detection of senile plaques, no PET probe is currently available for selective detection of neurofibrillary tangles in the living human brain. Recently, [(18)F]THK-523 was developed as a potential in vivo imaging probe for tau pathology. The purpose of this study was to compare the binding properties of [(18)F]THK-523 and other amyloid imaging agents, including PiB, BF-227 and FDDNP, to synthetic protein fibrils and human brain tissue. METHODS: In vitro radioligand binding assays were conducted using synthetic amyloid beta(42) and K18DeltaK280-tau fibrils. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of unlabelled compounds at a concentration of 2 muM. To examine radioligand binding to neuropathological lesions, in vitro autoradiography was conducted using sections of AD brain. RESULTS: [(18)F]THK-523 showed higher affinity for tau fibrils than for Abeta fibrils, whereas the other probes showed a higher affinity for Abeta fibrils. The autoradiographic analysis indicated that [(18)F]THK-523 accumulated in the regions containing a high density of tau protein deposits. Conversely, PiB and BF-227 accumulated in the regions containing a high density of Abeta plaques. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the unique binding profile of [(18)F]THK-523 can be used to identify tau deposits in AD brain.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrovascular amyloidosis caused by amyloid accumulation in blood vessel walls may lead to hemorrhagic stroke and cognitive impairment. Expression of TGF-beta1 under glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter in mice leads to age-related deposition of amyloid, including beta-amyloid (Abeta), around cerebral blood vessels, leading to vascular pathology starting at age of 7 months. We have recently shown the important role of macrophages in clearing cerebrovascular amyloid. Scavenger receptor A (SRA) is a multi-ligand and multifunctional receptor expressed on macrophages, and it has been suggested to play a role in meditating phagocytosis of different types of antigens. We investigated the role of SRA in mediating cerebrovascular amyloid clearance. We bred TGF-beta1 mice with SRA(-/-) mice and discovered that TGF-beta1/SRA(-/-) mice showed cerebrovascular pathology at an earlier age (3 months) compared with TGF-beta1 mice. Furthermore, SRA deficiency in macrophages led to impaired clearing of congophilic cerebrovascular amyloid from amyloid precursor protein mouse model and led to reduced phagocytosis of both soluble and insoluble Abeta in vivo as compared with macrophages from wild-type mice. Our findings demonstrate the important role of SRA in cerebrovascular amyloid pathology and suggest targeting SRA for future diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for cerebral amyloid angiopathy.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In Parkinson's disease (PD), the motor presentation characterised by postural instability/gait difficulties (PIGD) heralds accelerated motor, functional and cognitive decline, as compared with the more benign tremor-dominant (TD) variant. This makes the PIGD complex an attractive target for the discovery of prognostic biomarkers in PD. OBJECTIVE: To explore in vivo whether variability in brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) metabolism affects the initial motor presentation in PD. METHODS: We quantified cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations and ratios of Abeta42, Abeta40 and Abeta38 using a triplex immunoassay in 99 patients with de novo PD with the PIGD phenotype (n=39) or the TD phenotype (n=60). All patients underwent standardised assessments of motor and neuropsychological function and cerebral MRI. 46 age-matched normal controls served as external reference. RESULTS: Patients with PD with the PIGD phenotype had significantly reduced CSF Abeta42, Abeta38, Abeta42/40 and Abeta38/40 levels compared with patients with the TD phenotype and controls. CSF marker levels in patients with PD-TD did not differ from those in controls. Multivariate regression models demonstrated significant associations of CSF Abeta markers with severity of PIGD and lower limb bradykinesia in patients with PD, independently from age, MRI white matter hyperintensities and cognition. No associations were found between CSF markers and other motor features. CONCLUSIONS: Motor heterogeneity in de novo PD independently relates to CSF Abeta markers, with low levels found in patients with the PIGD presentation. This suggests that disturbed Abeta metabolism has an effect on PD beyond cognition and may contribute to the variable rate of motor and functional decline in PD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is not clear whether this relationship persists among the oldest old. Several European studies suggest that the effect of the APOE epsilon4 allele on dementia and mortality disappears in very old age. We describe the APOE allele and genotype frequencies and examine whether the presence of the APOE epsilon4 or APOE epsilon2 alleles is related to prevalent dementia, incident dementia, and mortality in a population-based cohort of oldest-old participants in the United States. METHODS: We studied 904 participants aged 90 years and older from The 90+ Study. Eight hundred two (89%) participants were genotyped and included in the prevalent dementia and mortality analyses. The 520 initially nondemented participants were included in the incident dementia analyses and were evaluated for dementia every 6 months. RESULTS: The APOE epsilon4 allele was significantly associated with prevalent dementia (odds ratio = 2.06) and AD (odds ratio = 2.37) in women but not in men. The APOE epsilon2 allele was not related to prevalent dementia in either sex. After an average follow-up of 2.4 years, 188 incident dementia cases were identified. Neither the APOE epsilon4 nor the APOE epsilon2 allele was related to incident dementia or AD. Five hundred ten (64%) participants died after an average follow-up of 2.3 years, and their mortality was not related to the presence of either the APOE epsilon2 or APOE epsilon4 allele. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the associations between APOE epsilon4, dementia, and mortality are age dependent, and that APOE epsilon4 no longer plays a role in dementia and mortality at very old ages.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We aimed to develop a prediction model based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, that would yield a single estimate representing the probability that dementia in a memory clinic patient is due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: All patients suspected of dementia in whom the CSF biomarkers had been analyzed were selected from a memory clinic database. Clinical diagnosis was AD (n = 272) or non-AD (n = 289). The prediction model was developed with logistic regression analysis and included CSF amyloid beta42, CSF phosphorylated tau181, and sex. Validation was performed on an independent data set from another memory clinic, containing 334 AD and 157 non-AD patients. RESULTS: The prediction model estimated the probability that AD is present as follows: p(AD) = 1/(1 + e (- [-0.3315 + score])), where score is calculated from -1.9486 x ln(amyloid beta42) + 2.7915 x ln(phosphorylated tau181) + 0.9178 x sex (male = 0, female = 1). When applied to the validation data set, the discriminative ability of the model was very good (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.85). The agreement between the probability of AD predicted by the model and the observed frequency of AD diagnoses was very good after taking into account the difference in AD prevalence between the two memory clinics.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease pathomimetic toxicity could be induced in mice within one week after the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of an aggregated preparation of the highly toxic and endogenous amyloid-beta fragment Abeta(25-35). It was recently reported that Abeta(25-35) also provokes a modification of APP processing with accumulation of endogenous Abeta(1-42). We here analyzed whether a gamma-secretase inhibitor, BMS-299897, attenuated this Abeta(25-35)-induced Abeta(1-42) seeding and toxicity. The compound was administered at 0.1-1 nmol/mouse, concomittantly with Abeta(25-35) (9 nmol) in male Swiss mice. After one week, the contents in Abeta(1-42) and Abeta(1-40), and the levels in lipid peroxidation were analyzed in the mouse hippocampus. Mice were submitted to spontaneous alternation, passive avoidance and object recognition to analyze their short- and long-term memory abilities. Abeta(25-35) increased Abeta(1-42) content (+240%) but failed to affect Abeta(1-40). BMS-299897 blocked the increase in Abeta(1-42) content and decreased Abeta(1-40) levels significantly. The compound did not affect Abeta(25-35)-induced increase in hippocampal lipid peroxidation. Behaviorally, BMS-299897 blocked the Abeta(25-35)-induced deficits in spontaneous alternation or novel object recognition, using a 1h intertrial time interval. BMS-299896 failed to affect the passive avoidance impairments or novel object recognition, using a 24h intertrial time interval. These results confirmed that Abeta(25-35) injection provoked an accumulation in endogenous Abeta(1-42), an effect blocked by gamma-secretase inhibition. This Abeta(1-42) accumulation marginally contributed to the toxicity or long-term memory deficits. However, since the seeded Abeta(1-42) affected short-term memory, the rapid Abeta(25-35) injection Alzheimer's disease model could be used to screen the activity of new secretase inhibitors.",

METHODS: The present study explored the correlation between BACE1 activity and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of APP metabolism and axonal degeneration in 63 patients with mild AD and 12 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: In the AD group, positive correlations between BACE1 activity and soluble APP beta, the APP sorting receptor sortilin-related receptor with A-type repeats (also known as SorLA or LR11), and tau were detected. BACE1 activity was not associated with amyloid beta1-42 or soluble APP alpha concentrations in the AD group, and no associations between BACE1 activity and any of the protein concentrations were found in the control group. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the relevance of BACE1 and sortilin-related receptor with A-type repeats within the amyloid cascade and also provide a further piece of evidence for the link between amyloid and tau pathology in AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) are two common pathologies associated with beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation and inflammation in the brain; neither is well understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate human post-mortem brains from AD subjects with purely parenchymal pathology, and those with concomitant CAA (and age-matched controls) for differential expression of microglia-associated Abeta ligands thought to mediate Abeta clearance and the association of these receptors with complement activation. Homogenates of brain parenchyma and enriched microvessel fractions from occipital cortex were probed for levels of C3b, membrane attack complex (MAC), CD11b and alpha-2-macroglobulin and immunoprecipitation was used to immunoprecipitate (IP) CD11b complexed with C3b and Abeta. Both C3b and MAC were significantly increased in CAA compared to AD-only and controls and IP showed significantly increased CD11b/C3b complexes with Abeta in AD/CAA subjects. Confocal microscopy was used to visualize these interactions. MAC was remarkably associated with CAA-affected blood vessels compared to AD-only and control vessels. These findings are consistent with an Abeta clearance mechanism via microglial CD11b that delivers Abeta and C3b to blood vessels in AD/CAA, which leads to Abeta deposition and propagation of complement to the cytolytic MAC, possibly leading to vascular fragility.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, inflammation and synaptic and neuronal loss are some of the major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While genetic mutations in amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 and -2 (PS1 and PS2) genes cause early-onset familial AD, the etiology of sporadic AD is not fully understood. Our current study shows that changes in conformation of endogenous wild-type PS1, similar to those found with mutant PS1, occur in sporadic AD brain and during normal aging. Using a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (Tg2576) that overexpresses the Swedish mutation of amyloid precursor protein but has normal levels of endogenous wild-type presenilin, we report that the percentage of PS1 in a pathogenic conformation increases with age. Importantly, we found that this PS1 conformational shift is associated with amyloid pathology and precedes amyloid-beta deposition in the brain. Furthermore, we found that oxidative stress, a common stress characteristic of aging and AD, causes pathogenic PS1 conformational change in neurons in vitro, which is accompanied by increased Abeta42/40 ratio. The results of this study provide important information about the timeline of pathogenic changes in PS1 conformation during aging and suggest that structural changes in PS1/gamma-secretase may represent a molecular mechanism by which oxidative stress triggers amyloid-beta accumulation in aging and in sporadic AD brain.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The assessment of total tau, phosphorylated tau (pTau-181) and amyloid beta (Abeta 1-42) concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of subjects has been validated for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although these measurements have shown some variability, little is known about their intersite variability in clinical settings. METHODS: A total of 880 subjects (AD, n = 515; non-AD, n = 365) from three French memory centers were included. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses were performed to computerized area under curves (AUCs) and optimal thresholds for each biomarker in the three centers. A test-retest study was performed in a group of 32 CSF samples by repeated blind analysis of the three biomarkers using the same immunoassay batches in the three centers. RESULTS: In the three centers, tau (AUC, 0.82-0.88) and pTau-181 (AUC, 0.83-0.89) outperformed Abeta 1-42 (AUC, 0.70 -0.73) to discriminate subjects with AD from those without AD. An intersite variation of mean levels and cutoffs was observed for the three biomarkers. This variation was higher for Abeta 1-42 (range of cutoff, 368-582 pg/mL) than for tau (range of cutoff, 289-353 pg/mL). In a test-retest study, the mean interlaboratory coefficients of variation were 12.2% for Abeta 1-42, 11.3% for tau, and 11.5% for pTau-181. CONCLUSION: Intercenter variability of CSF biomarkers has been confirmed in a multisite cohort of subjects and can be improved in clinical settings. Efforts on harmonization of procedures should be encouraged to optimize the accuracy of CSF biomarkers in AD.",

    "abstract": "Misfolding and aggregation of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Both processes are dependent on the environmental conditions, including the presence of divalent cations, such as Cu(2+). Cu(2+) cations regulate early stages of Abeta aggregation, but the molecular mechanism of Cu(2+) regulation is unknown. In this study we applied single molecule AFM force spectroscopy to elucidate the role of Cu(2+) cations on interpeptide interactions. By immobilizing one of two interacting Abeta42 molecules on a mica surface and tethering the counterpart molecule onto the tip, we were able to probe the interpeptide interactions in the presence and absence of Cu(2+) cations at pH 7.4, 6.8, 6.0, 5.0, and 4.0. The results show that the presence of Cu(2+) cations change the pattern of Abeta interactions for pH values between pH 7.4 and pH 5.0. Under these conditions, Cu(2+) cations induce Abeta42 peptide structural changes resulting in N-termini interactions within the dimers. Cu(2+) cations also stabilize the dimers. No effects of Cu(2+) cations on Abeta-Abeta interactions were observed at pH 4.0, suggesting that peptide protonation changes the peptide-cation interaction. The effect of Cu(2+) cations on later stages of Abeta aggregation was studied by AFM topographic images. The results demonstrate that substoichiometric Cu(2+) cations accelerate the formation of fibrils at pH 7.4 and 5.0, whereas no effect of Cu(2+) cations was observed at pH 4.0. Taken together, the combined AFM force spectroscopy and imaging analyses demonstrate that Cu(2+) cations promote both the initial and the elongation stages of Abeta aggregation, but protein protonation diminishes the effect of Cu(2+).",

    "abstract": "Clinical studies suggest that traumatic brain injury (TBI) hastens cognitive decline and development of neuropathology resembling brain aging. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption following TBI may contribute to the aging process by deregulating substance exchange between the brain and blood. We evaluated the effect of juvenile TBI (jTBI) on these processes by examining long-term alterations of BBB proteins, beta-amyloid (Abeta) neuropathology, and cognitive changes. A controlled cortical impact was delivered to the parietal cortex of male rats at postnatal day 17, with behavioral studies and brain tissue evaluation at 60 days post-injury (dpi). Immunoglobulin G extravasation was unchanged, and jTBI animals had higher levels of tight-junction protein claudin 5 versus shams, suggesting the absence of BBB disruption. However, decreased P-glycoprotein (P-gp) on cortical blood vessels indicates modifications of BBB properties. In parallel, we observed higher levels of endogenous rodent Abeta in several brain regions of the jTBI group versus shams. In addition at 60 dpi, jTBI animals displayed systematic search strategies rather than relying on spatial memory during the water maze. Together, these alterations to the BBB phenotype after jTBI may contribute to the accumulation of toxic products, which in turn may induce cognitive differences and ultimately accelerate brain aging.",

    "abstract": "Complement protein C1q is induced in the brain in response to a variety of neuronal injuries, including Alzheimer disease (AD), and blocks fibrillar amyloid-beta (fAbeta) neurotoxicity in vitro. Here, we show that C1q protects immature and mature primary neurons against fAbeta toxicity, and we report for the first time that C1q prevents toxicity induced by oligomeric forms of amyloid-beta (Abeta). Gene expression analysis reveals C1q-activated phosphorylated cAMP-response element-binding protein and AP-1, two transcription factors associated with neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth, and increased LRP1B and G protein-coupled receptor 6(GPR6) expression in fAbeta-injured neurons. Silencing of cAMP-response element-binding protein, LRP1B or GPR6 expression inhibited C1q-mediated neuroprotection from fAbeta-induced injury. In addition, C1q altered the association of oligomeric Abeta and fAbeta with neurons. In vivo, increased hippocampal expression of C1q, LRP1B, and GPR6 is observed as early as 2 months of age in the 3 x Tg mouse model of AD, whereas no such induction of LRP1B and GPR6 was seen in C1q-deficient AD mice. In contrast, expression of C1r and C1s, proteases required to activate the classical complement pathway, and C3 showed a significant age-dependent increase only after 10-13 months of age when Abeta plaques start to accumulate in this AD model. Thus, our results identify pathways by which C1q, up-regulated in vivo early in response to injury without the coordinate induction of other complement components, can induce a program of gene expression that promotes neuroprotection and thus may provide protection against Abeta in preclinical stages of AD and other neurodegenerative processes.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in TREM2, encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 protein, have previously been associated with an autosomal recessive form of early-onset dementia. METHODS: We used genome, exome, and Sanger sequencing to analyze the genetic variability in TREM2 in a series of 1092 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 1107 controls (the discovery set). We then performed a meta-analysis on imputed data for the TREM2 variant rs75932628 (predicted to cause a R47H substitution) from three genomewide association studies of Alzheimer's disease and tested for the association of the variant with disease. We genotyped the R47H variant in an additional 1887 cases and 4061 controls. We then assayed the expression of TREM2 across different regions of the human brain and identified genes that are differentially expressed in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and in control mice. RESULTS: We found significantly more variants in exon 2 of TREM2 in patients with Alzheimer's disease than in controls in the discovery set (P=0.02). There were 22 variant alleles in 1092 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 5 variant alleles in 1107 controls (P<0.001). The most commonly associated variant, rs75932628 (encoding R47H), showed highly significant association with Alzheimer's disease (P<0.001). Meta-analysis of rs75932628 genotypes imputed from genomewide association studies confirmed this association (P=0.002), as did direct genotyping of an additional series of 1887 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 4061 controls (P<0.001). Trem2 expression differed between control mice and a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous rare variants in TREM2 are associated with a significant increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease. (Funded by Alzheimer's Research UK and others.).",

    "title": "Interplay between alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretases determines biphasic amyloid-beta protein level in the presence of a gamma-secretase inhibitor.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is produced by the consecutive cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) first by beta-secretase, generating C99, and then by gamma-secretase. APP is also cleaved by alpha-secretase. It is hypothesized that reducing the production of Abeta in the brain may slow the progression of Alzheimer disease. Therefore, different gamma-secretase inhibitors have been developed to reduce Abeta production. Paradoxically, it has been shown that low to moderate inhibitor concentrations cause a rise in Abeta production in different cell lines, in different animal models, and also in humans. A mechanistic understanding of the Abeta rise remains elusive. Here, a minimal mathematical model has been developed that quantitatively describes the Abeta dynamics in cell lines that exhibit the rise as well as in cell lines that do not. The model includes steps of APP processing through both the so-called amyloidogenic pathway and the so-called non-amyloidogenic pathway. It is shown that the cross-talk between these two pathways accounts for the increase in Abeta production in response to inhibitor, i.e. an increase in C99 will inhibit the non-amyloidogenic pathway, redirecting APP to be cleaved by beta-secretase, leading to an additional increase in C99 that overcomes the loss in gamma-secretase activity. With a minor extension, the model also describes plasma Abeta profiles observed in humans upon dosing with a gamma-secretase inhibitor. In conclusion, this mechanistic model rationalizes a series of experimental results that spans from in vitro to in vivo and to humans. This has important implications for the development of drugs targeting Abeta production in Alzheimer disease.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposits is a primary pathological feature of Alzheimer disease that is correlated with neurotoxicity and cognitive decline. The role of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis has been debated. To study the role of GSK-3 in Abeta pathology, we used 5XFAD mice co-expressing mutated amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 that develop massive cerebral Abeta loads. Both GSK-3 isozymes (alpha/beta) were hyperactive in this model. Nasal treatment of 5XFAD mice with a novel substrate competitive GSK-3 inhibitor, L803-mts, reduced Abeta deposits and ameliorated cognitive deficits. Analyses of 5XFAD hemi-brain samples indicated that L803-mts restored the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and inhibited autophagy. Lysosomal acidification was impaired in the 5XFAD brains as indicated by reduced cathepsin D activity and decreased N-glycoyslation of the vacuolar ATPase subunit V0a1, a modification required for lysosomal acidification. Treatment with L803-mts restored lysosomal acidification in 5XFAD brains. Studies in SH-SY5Y cells confirmed that GSK-3alpha and GSK-3beta impair lysosomal acidification and that treatment with L803-mts enhanced the acidic lysosomal pool as demonstrated in LysoTracker Red-stained cells. Furthermore, L803-mts restored impaired lysosomal acidification caused by dysfunctional presenilin-1. We provide evidence that mTOR is a target activated by GSK-3 but inhibited by impaired lysosomal acidification and elevation in amyloid precursor protein/Abeta loads. Taken together, our data indicate that GSK-3 is a player in Abeta pathology. Inhibition of GSK-3 restores lysosomal acidification that in turn enables clearance of Abeta burdens and reactivation of mTOR. These changes facilitate amelioration in cognitive function.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid fibrils implicated in numerous human diseases are thermodynamically very stable. Stringent conditions that would not be possible in a physiological environment are often required to disrupt the stable fibrils. Recently, there is increasing evidence that small molecules can remodel amyloid fibrils in a physiologically relevant manner. In order to investigate possible fibril remodeling mechanisms using this approach, we performed comparative studies on the structural features of the different amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates remodeled from Abeta fibrils by three biocompatible small molecules: methylene blue; brilliant blue G; and erythrosine B. Combined with circular dichroism (CD), immuno-blotting, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) results, it was found that brilliant blue G- and erythrosine B-treatment generate fragmented Abeta fibrils and protofibrils, respectively. In contrast, incubation of the Abeta fibrils with methylene blue perturbs fibrillar structure, leading to amorphous Abeta aggregates. Our findings provide insights on the molecular mechanism of amyloid fibril formation and remodeling and also illustrate the possibility of controlled changes in biomolecule nanostructures.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Only one study has investigated the relationship between cerebral beta-amyloid (Abeta), apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 genotype, and cognition. Although significant relationships between cerebral Abeta and cognition were observed in epsilon4 carriers but not noncarriers, the magnitude of this relationship was not reported. Further, when demographic variables were controlled, the influence of APOE epsilon4 on the relationship between cerebral Abeta and cognition dissipated. METHODS: In 144 healthy older adults who had undergone amyloid scanning and APOE epsilon4 genotyping in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle (AIBL) Flagship Study of Ageing, correlations were conducted to determine the magnitude of relationship between cerebral Abeta and cognition in epsilon4 carriers and noncarriers. Fisher's Z was used to compare these correlations and Cohen's q determined the magnitude of difference between correlations. RESULTS: Cerebral Abeta was significantly associated with tasks of visual and verbal episodic memory in APOE epsilon4 carriers. This association was not observed in epsilon4 noncarriers. The relationship between cerebral Abeta and episodic memory in epsilon4 carriers was significantly different from that in epsilon4 noncarriers, and the magnitude of this difference was small to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: In APOE epsilon 4 carriers, there is a moderate negative relationship between cerebral Abeta and episodic memory. This suggests that increased cerebral Abeta may signify the onset of preclinical AD, especially in healthy older adults who are genetically at risk for AD.",

    "abstract": "Certain preparations of Alzheimer-associated amyloid beta (Abeta) exhibit rapid (within minutes) synaptotoxicity when applied to hippocampal slices or neuronal cell cultures, or when injected into the central nervous system of rodents. In addition, it is well known that some elderly people have brain amyloidosis without showing signs of cognitive impairment or neurodegeneration beyond the age norm. Biomarkers, reviewed extensively in a recent Perspectives article in Alzheimer's & Dementia, suggest that amyloid-positive individuals are at higher risk of Alzheimer's disease than similarly aged individuals without evidence of brain amyloidosis, provided they live long enough. But how can the brain resist amyloid pathology for many years? Here, we expand on recent biomarker studies suggesting that Abeta build-up and toxicity may occur in two phases. We hypothesize that the first phase may involve an autocatalytic build-up of a nontoxic Abeta reservoir, tentatively named the Abeta(Cat) pool, and that gain of toxicity may require brain incubation of Abeta in the water-deprived plaque milieu over years to produce modified forms of the protein that are truly neurotoxic (Abeta(Tox)). We argue for the need to describe the molecular natures of Abeta(Cat) and Abeta(Tox) in greater detail as a means to gain success in anti-Abeta disease-modifying drug development.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the abnormal aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta)1-40 and Abeta1-42 peptides into fibrils. In this work, we analyzed the kinetics of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 fibril formation in vitro using Thioflavin T fluorescence. We synthesized high-purity peptides and performed a hexafluoro-2-propanol pre-treatment to yield uniform peptide solutions as starting materials. We found that the aggregation is clearly affected by the presence of sub-millimolar quantities of antibodies against the C-terminal region of the peptides. Because the fibrillization of these peptides is closely related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, blocking this process may provide significant therapeutic benefit.",

Healthy older adults and adults with aMCI enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarker, and Lifestyle study, completed the CogState brief battery at baseline and 18 months, and underwent positron emission tomography neuroimaging for Abeta at baseline. In this study, we included adults with MCI who had been classified as having high and low levels of Abeta and healthy older adults who had been classified as having low levels of Abeta. Linear model analyses adjusted for baseline cognitive function indicated that relative to healthy older adults with low Abeta, adults with aMCI and high Abeta showed greater decline in working memory and in verbal and visual episodic memory at 18 months. Adults with aMCI and low Abeta also showed greater decline in working memory; however they did not evidence any decline in episodic memory at 18 months. The results of our study suggests that relative to healthy older adults and adults with aMCI with low Abeta, adults with aMCI and high levels of Abeta showed faster rates of decline on measures of episodic memory over 18 months, and this was approximately twice that observed previously for healthy older adults with high Abeta levels.",

    "abstract": "Imbalanced homeostasis and oligomerization of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in the brain are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglia and macrophages play a critical role in the etiology of AD either by clearing Abeta from the brain or inducing inflammation. Recent evidence suggests that clearance of Abeta by microglia/macrophages via the phagocytic pathway is defective in AD, which can contribute to the accumulation of Abeta in the brain. We have recently demonstrated that protein microspheres modified at their surface with multiple copies of an Abeta-recognition motif can strongly bind Abeta, inhibit its aggregation, and directly reduce its toxicity by sequestering it from the medium. Here, we describe how microsphere-bound Abeta can stimulate microglial cells and be phagocytosed through a mechanism that is distinct from that of Abeta removal and, thus, contribute to the clearance of Abeta, even by defective microglial cells. The phagocytosis was most effective, with microspheres having a diameter of <1 mum. The introduction of polyethylene glycol to the surface of the microspheres changed the kinetics of the phagocytosis. Moreover, while aggregated Abeta induced a significant inflammatory response that was manifested by the release of TNF-alpha, the microsphere-bound Abeta dramatically reduced the amount of cytokine released from microglial cells.",

    "abstract": "Over the past 30 years, many drugs have been studied as possible treatments for Alzheimer's disease, but only four have demonstrated sufficient efficacy to be approved as treatments, of which three are in the same class. This lack of success has raised questions both in the pharmaceutical industry and academia about the future of Alzheimer's disease therapy. The high cost and low success rate of drug development across many disease areas can be attributed, in large part, to late-stage clinical failures (Schachter and Ramoni, Nat Rev Drug Discov 2007;6:107-8). Thus, identifying in phase II, or preferably phase I, drugs that are likely to fail would have a dramatic impact on the costs associated with developing new drugs. With this in mind, the Alzheimer's Association convened a Research Roundtable on June 23 and 24, 2011, in Washington, DC, bringing together scientists from academia, industry, and government regulatory agencies to discuss strategies for improving the probability of phase II trial results predicting success when considering the go/no-go decision-making process leading to the initiation of phase III.",

METHODS: Thirteen nondemented (normal or cognitively impaired nondemented) participants (median age, 94.2 years) from The 90+ Study underwent florbetapir-PET scanning within 3 months of baseline neuropsychological testing. Amyloid load was measured with a semi-automated quantitative analysis of average cortical-to-cerebellar standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) and a visual interpretation (Abeta- or Abeta+). Neuropsychological testing was repeated every 6 months. RESULTS: At baseline, SUVr correlated significantly with tests of global cognition and memory. During follow-up (median, 1.5 years), the Abeta+ group had steeper declines on most cognitive tests, particularly global cognitive measures. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study suggests that greater amyloid load is associated with poorer cognition and faster cognitive decline in nondemented oldest-old. Amyloid load may identify individuals at increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PiB) and (18)F-florbetapir amyloid-beta (Abeta) PET radioligands have had a substantial impact on Alzheimer disease research. Although there is evidence that both radioligands bind to fibrillar Abeta in the brain, direct comparisons in the same individuals have not been reported. Here, we evaluated PiB and florbetapir in a retrospective convenience sample of cognitively normal older controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment, and patients with Alzheimer disease from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). METHODS: From the ADNI database, 32 participants were identified who had undergone at least 1 PiB study and subsequently underwent a florbetapir study approximately 1.5 y after the last PiB study. Cortical PiB and florbetapir retention was quantified using several different methods to determine the effect of preprocessing factors (such as smoothing and reference region selection) and image processing pipelines. RESULTS: There was a strong association between PiB and florbetapir cortical retention ratios (Spearman rho = 0.86-0.95), and these were slightly lower than cortical retention ratios for consecutive PiB scans (Spearman rho = 0.96-0.98) made approximately 1.1 y apart. Cortical retention ratios for Abeta-positive subjects tended to be higher for PiB than for florbetapir images, yielding slopes for linear regression of florbetapir against PiB of 0.59-0.64. Associations between consecutive PiB scans and between PiB and florbetapir scans remained strong, regardless of processing methods such as smoothing, spatial normalization to a PET template, and use of reference regions. The PiB-florbetapir association was used to interconvert cutoffs for Abeta positivity and negativity between the 2 radioligands, and these cutoffs were highly consistent in their assignment of Abeta status. CONCLUSION: PiB and florbetapir retention ratios were strongly associated in the same individuals, and this relationship was consistent across several data analysis methods, despite scan-rescan intervals of more than a year. Cutoff thresholds for determining positive or negative Abeta status can be reliably transformed from PiB to florbetapir units or vice versa using a population scanned with both radioligands.",

    "title": "Review: experimental manipulations of microglia in mouse models of Alzheimer's pathology: activation reduces amyloid but hastens tau pathology.",
    "abstract": "The inflammation hypothesis of Alzheimer's pathogenesis has directed much scientific effort towards ameliorating this disease. The development of mouse models of amyloid deposition permitted direct tests of the proposal that amyloid-activated microglia could cause neurodegeneration in vivo. Many approaches to manipulating microglial activation have been applied to these mouse models, and are the subject of this review. In general, these results do not support a direct neuricidal action of microglia in mouse amyloid models under any activation state. Some of the manipulations cause both a reduction in pathology and a reduction in microglial activation. However, at least for agents like ibuprofen, this outcome may result from a direct action on amyloid production, and a reduction in the microglial-provoking amyloid deposits, rather than from reduced microglial activation leading to a decline in amyloid deposition. Instead, a surprising number of the experimental manipulations which increase microglial activation lead to enhanced clearance of the amyloid deposits. Both the literature and new data presented here suggest that either classical or alternative activation of microglia can lead to enhanced amyloid clearance. However, a limited number of studies comparing the same treatments in amyloid-depositing vs. tau-depositing mice find the opposite effects. Treatments that benefit amyloid pathology accelerate tau pathology. This observation argues strongly that potential treatments be tested for impact on both amyloid and tau pathology before consideration of testing in humans.",

METHODS: (18)F-flutemetamol-labeled amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to classify 10 young normal, 15 elderly normal, 20 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 27 AD subjects. MTA+ status was determined using a cut point derived from a previous study, and Am+ status was determined using a conservative and liberal cut point. RESULTS: The rates of MRI scans with positive results among young normal, elderly normal, aMCI, and AD subjects were 0%, 20%, 75%, and 82%, respectively. Using conservative cut points, the rates of Am+ scans for these same groups of subjects were 0%, 7%, 50%, and 93%, respectively, with the aMCI group showing the largest discrepancy between Am+ and MTA+ scans. Among aMCI cases, 80% of Am+ subjects were also MTA+, and 70% of amyloid-negative (Am-) subjects were MTA+. The combination of amyloid PET and MTA data was additive, with an overall correct classification rate for aMCI of 86%, when a liberal cut point (standard uptake value ratio = 1.4) was used for amyloid positivity.

    "abstract": "Cholinergic dysfunction and deposition of plaques containing amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta) are two of the characteristics of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we combine APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice with the cholinergic immunotoxin mu p75-saporin (SAP) to integrate partial basal forebrain cholinergic degeneration and the neuropathology of APP/PS1 mice. By 6 months of age, APP/PS1 mice and wild type littermates (Wt) received intracerebroventricular injection of 0.6 mug SAP (lesion) or PBS (sham). Two months following surgery, APP/PS1 mice treated with SAP were significantly impaired compared to sham treated APP/PS1 mice in a behavioural paradigm addressing working memory. Conversely, the performance of Wt mice was unaffected by SAP treatment. Choline acetyltransferase activity was reduced in the hippocampus and frontal cortex following SAP treatment. The selective effect of a mild SAP lesion in APP/PS1 mice was not due to a more extensive cholinergic degeneration since the reduction in choline acetyltransferase activity was similar following SAP treatment in APP/PS1 mice and Wt. Interestingly, plaque load was significantly increased in SAP treated APP/PS1 mice relative to sham lesioned APP/PS1 mice. Additionally, APP/PS1 mice treated with SAP showed a tendency towards an increased level of soluble and insoluble Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 measured in brain tissue homogenate. Our results suggest that the combination of cholinergic degeneration and Abeta overexpression in the APP/PS1 mouse model results in cognitive decline and accelerated plaque burden. SAP treated APP/PS1 mice might thus constitute an improved model of Alzheimer's disease-like neuropathology and cognitive deficits compared to the conventional APP/PS1 model without selective removal of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons.",

    "abstract": "In a genome-wide expression profile search for genes required for Drosophila R7 photoreceptor development we found beta amyloid protein precursor-like (Appl), the ortholog of human APP, which is a key factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We analyzed Appl expression in the eye imaginal disc and found that is highly accumulated in R7 photoreceptor cells. The R7 photoreceptor is responsible for UV light detection. To explore the link between high expression of Appl and R7 function, we have analyzed Appl null mutants and found reduced preference for UV light, probably because of mistargeted R7 axons. Moreover, axon mistargeting and inappropriate light discrimination are enhanced in combination with neurotactin mutants. R7 differentiation is triggered by the inductive interaction between R8 and R7 precursors, which results in a burst of Ras1/MAPK, activated by the tyrosine kinase receptor Sevenless. Therefore, we examined whether Ras1/MAPK is responsible for the high Appl expression. Inhibition of Ras1 signaling leads to reduced Appl expression, whereas constitutive activation drives ectopic Appl expression. We show that Appl is directly regulated by the Ras/MAPK pathway through a mechanism mediated by PntP2, an ETS transcription factor that specifically binds ETS sites in the Appl regulatory region. We also found that zebrafish appb expression increased after ectopic fgfr activation in the neural tube of zebrafish embryos, suggesting a conserved regulatory mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is believed to play a central role in initiating the molecular cascade that culminates in Alzheimer-type dementia (AD), a disease which in its early stage is characterized by synaptic loss and impairment of episodic memory. Here we show that intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta-containing water-soluble extracts of AD brain inhibits consolidation of the memory of avoidance learning in the rat and that this effect is highly dependent on the interval between learning and administration. When injected at 1 hour post training extracts from 2 different AD brains significantly impaired recall tested at 48 hours. Ultrastructural examination of hippocampi from animals perfused after 48 hours revealed that Abeta-mediated impairment of avoidance memory was associated with lower density of synapses and altered synaptic structure in the dentate gyrus and CA1 fields. These behavioral and ultrastructural data suggest that human brain-derived Abeta impairs formation of long-term memory by compromising the structural plasticity essential for consolidation and that Abeta targets processes initiated very early in the consolidation pathway.",

    "abstract": "Despite tremendous investments in understanding the complex molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer disease (AD), recent clinical trials have failed to show efficacy. A potential problem underlying these failures is the assumption that the molecular mechanism mediating the genetically determined form of the disease is identical to the one resulting in late-onset AD. Here, we integrate experimental evidence outside the 'spotlight' of the genetic drivers of amyloid-beta (Abeta) generation published during the past two decades, and present a mechanistic explanation for the pathophysiological changes that characterize late-onset AD. We propose that chronic inflammatory conditions cause dysregulation of mechanisms to clear misfolded or damaged neuronal proteins that accumulate with age, and concomitantly lead to tau-associated impairments of axonal integrity and transport. Such changes have several neuropathological consequences: focal accumulation of mitochondria, resulting in metabolic impairments; induction of axonal swelling and leakage, followed by destabilization of synaptic contacts; deposition of amyloid precursor protein in swollen neurites, and generation of aggregation-prone peptides; further tau hyperphosphorylation, ultimately resulting in neurofibrillary tangle formation and neuronal death. The proposed sequence of events provides a link between Abeta and tau-related neuropathology, and underscores the concept that degenerating neurites represent a cause rather than a consequence of Abeta accumulation in late-onset AD.",

The predictive value of these biomarkers at the individual patient level, however, remains to be elucidated.

Mice were divided into four groups: two sham groups (WT, TG; n=7) and two exposed groups (WTS, TGS; n=7). The cognitive interference task used in this study was designed from an analogous human cognitive interference task including the Flex field activity system test, the two-compartment box test and the Barnes maze test.

    "title": "Investigating the binding interactions of galantamine with beta-amyloid peptide.",
    "abstract": "The anti-Alzheimer's agent galantamine is known to possess anti-amyloid properties. However the exact mechanisms are not clear. We studied the binding interactions of galantamine with amyloid peptide dimer (Abeta(1-40)) through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Galantamine's binding site within the amyloid peptide dimer was identified by docking experiments and the most stable complex was analyzed by molecular dynamics simulation. These studies show that galantamine was interacting with the central region of the amyloid dimer (Lys16-Ala21) and the C-terminal region (Ile31-Val36) with minimum structural drift of Calpha atom in those regions. Strikingly, a significant drift was observed at the turn region from Asp23-Gly29 (Calpha atom RMSD=9.2 A and 11.6 A at 50 fs and 100 fs respectively). Furthermore, galantamine's binding mode disrupts the key pi-pi stacking interaction between aromatic rings of Phe19 (chain A) and Phe19 (chain B) and intermolecular hydrogen bonds seen in unbound peptide dimer. Noticeably, the azepine tertiary nitrogen of galantamine was in close proximity to backbone CO of Leu34 (distance <3.5 A) to stabilize the dimer conformation. In summary, the results indicate that galantamine binding to amyloid peptide dimer leads to a significant conformational change at the turn region (Asp23-Gly29) that disrupts interactions between individual beta-strands and promotes a nontoxic conformation of Abeta(1-40) to prevent the formation of neurotoxic oligomers.",

    "abstract": "To examine the effects of the alpha3 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) on the expression of beta-secretase and the concomitant level of amyloid-beta (Abeta), SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were either transfected with small interference RNAs (siRNAs) specifically targeting this subunit or exposed to nicotine. The levels of alpha3 nAChR mRNA and protein, as well as the corresponding levels of BACE1 (which cleaves the beta-site of APP) and BACE2 (cleaving in the Abeta domain) were determined by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The levels of Abeta(1-42) in culture media were determined by an Elisa procedure. In SH-SY5Y cells transfected with siRNA, the levels of alpha3 nAChR mRNA and protein were reduced by 96% and 88%, respectively; the levels of BACE1 mRNA and protein were significantly enhanced, while those of BACE2 were reduced; and the level of Abeta in the culture medium was elevated. In contrast, when untransfected SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to nicotine, the levels of both alpha3 nAChR mRNA and protein were enhanced; while the levels of BACE1 mRNA and protein were diminished and the corresponding levels of BACE2 enhanced; and the level of Abeta in the culture medium was attenuated. These results indicate that the alpha3 subunit of nAChR inhibits the production of Abeta by reducing the expression of BACE1 and elevating the expression of BACE2, suggesting that this subunit might play an important neuroprotective role in connection with the pathogenesis of AD.",

    "abstract": "Herein, we investigated the effect Salvia sahendica (S. sahenica) extract, an endemic plant of Iran on the improvement of learning and memory deficits in amyloid beta-(Abeta) injected rats. In order to test this hypothesis, we pretreated rats with S. sahendica 1 week prior to Abeta injection, then performed Morris water maze test. Besides, we studied the molecular factors involved in neuronal plasticity and apoptosis such as Ca(2+)/cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), c-fos, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha), Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3. Moreover, we used Terminal-Transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) technique to detect apoptosis in the hippocampus of Abeta-injected rats. Results showed that S. sahendica could improve learning and memory in the behavioral test. The results of molecular section showed that CREB, c-fos and PGC-1alpha levels attenuated in the Abeta-injected rats in comparison with control group. These decreases were attenuated 58, 62, 57% respectively in S. sahendica-pretreated rats. This dietary supplementation could decrease apoptotic factors including caspase-3, PARP and TUNEL positive cells as well. Collectively, the present result from behavioral testing and biochemical analysis demonstrated that S. sahendica treatment for 1 week protected against apoptosis and memory deficits in Abeta-injected rats.",

    "abstract": "Compelling evidence from in vivo model systems within the past decade shows that the APP family of proteins is important for synaptic development and function in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The synaptic role promises to be complex and multifaceted for several reasons. The three family members have overlapping and redundant functions in mammals. They have both adhesive and signaling properties and may, in principle, act as both ligands and receptors. Moreover, they bind a multitude of synapse-specific proteins, and we predict that additional interacting protein partners will be discovered. Transgenic mice with modified or abolished expression of APP and APLPs have synaptic defects that are readily apparent. Studies of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in these transgenic mice have revealed molecular and functional deficits in neurotransmitter release, in organization of the postsynaptic receptors, and in coordinated intercellular development. The results summarized here from invertebrate and vertebrate systems confirm that the NMJ with its accessibility, large size, and homogeneity provides a model synapse for identifying and analyzing molecular pathways of APP actions.",

    "abstract": "beta-arrestins are associated with numerous aspects of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and regulation and accordingly influence diverse physiological and pathophysiological processes. Here we report that beta-arrestin 2 expression is elevated in two independent cohorts of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Overexpression of beta-arrestin 2 leads to an increase in amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide generation, whereas genetic silencing of Arrb2 (encoding beta-arrestin 2) reduces generation of Abeta in cell cultures and in Arrb2(-/-) mice. Moreover, in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, genetic deletion of Arrb2 leads to a reduction in the production of Abeta(40) and Abeta(42). Two GPCRs implicated previously in Alzheimer's disease (GPR3 and the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor) mediate their effects on Abeta generation through interaction with beta-arrestin 2. beta-arrestin 2 physically associates with the Aph-1a subunit of the gamma-secretase complex and redistributes the complex toward detergent-resistant membranes, increasing the catalytic activity of the complex. Collectively, these studies identify beta-arrestin 2 as a new therapeutic target for reducing amyloid pathology and GPCR dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a peptide that accumulates in the brain and circulates in the blood of patients with Alzheimer disease, alters the regulation of cerebral blood flow and may contribute to the brain dysfunction underlying the dementia. However, the contributions of brain and circulating Abeta1-40 to the vascular dysfunction have not been elucidated. METHODS: We used transgenic mice overexpressing mutated forms of the amyloid precursor protein in which Abeta1-40 is elevated in blood and brain (Tg-2576) or only in brain (Tg-SwDI). Mice were equipped with a cranial window, and the increase in cerebral blood flow induced by neural activity (whisker stimulation), or by topical application of endothelium-dependent vasodilators, was assessed by laser-Doppler flowmetry. RESULTS: The cerebrovascular dysfunction was observed also in Tg-SwDI mice, but despite  40% higher levels of brain Abeta1-40, the effect was less marked than in Tg-2576 mice. Intravascular administration of Abeta1-40 elevated plasma Abeta1-40 and enhanced the dysfunction in Tg-SwDI mice, but not in Tg-2576 mice. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide evidence that Abeta1-40 acts on distinct luminal and abluminal vascular targets, the deleterious cerebrovascular effects of which are additive. Furthermore, the findings highlight the importance of circulating Abeta1-40 in the cerebrovascular dysfunction and may provide insight into the cerebrovascular alterations in conditions in which elevations in plasma Abeta1-40 occur.",

    "abstract": "The overproduction of beta-amyloid (Abeta) fragments in transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 mice results in formation of amyloid deposits in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus starting around four months of age and leading to cognitive impairment much later. We have previously found an age and transgene-dependent weakening of muscarinic receptor-mediated transmission that was not present in young (6-10-week-old) animals but preceded both amyloid deposits and cognitive deficits. Now we investigated immediate and prolonged in vitro effects of non-aggregated Abeta(1-42) on coupling of individual muscarinic receptor subtypes expressed in CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells and their underlying mechanisms. Immediate application of 1 muM Abeta(1-42) had no effect on the binding of the muscarinic antagonist N-methylscopolamine or the agonist carbachol. In contrast, 4-day treatment of CHO cells expressing the M1 muscarinic receptor with 100 nM Abeta(1-42) significantly changed the binding characteristics of the muscarinic agonist carbachol and reduced the extent of the M1 receptor-stimulated breakdown of phosphatidylinositol while it did not demonstrate overt toxic effects. The treatment had no influence on the expression of either G-proteins or muscarinic receptors. In concert, we found no change in the gene expression of muscarinic receptor subtypes and gene or protein expression of the G(s), G(q/11), and G(i/o) G-proteins in the cerebral cortex of young adult APPswe/PS1dE9 mice that demonstrate high concentrations of soluble Abeta(1-42) and impaired muscarinic receptor-mediated G-protein activation. Our results provide strong evidence that the initial injurious effects of Abeta(1-42) on M1 muscarinic receptor-mediated transmissionis is due to compromised coupling of the receptor with G(q/11) G-protein.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and complex neurodegenerative disease in which the gamma-secretase-mediated amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology plays an important role. We found that a multifunctional protein, beta-arrestin1, facilitated the formation of NCT/APH-1 (anterior pharynx-defective phenotype 1) precomplex and mature gamma-secretase complex through its functional interaction with APH-1. Deficiency of beta-arrestin1 or inhibition of binding of beta-arrestin1 with APH-1 by small peptides reduced Abeta production without affecting Notch processing. Genetic ablation of beta-arrestin1 diminished Abeta pathology and behavioral deficits in transgenic AD mice. Moreover, in brains of sporadic AD patients and transgenic AD mice, the expression of beta-arrestin1 was upregulated and correlated well with neuropathological severity and senile Abeta plaques. Thus, our study identifies a regulatory mechanism underlying both gamma-secretase assembly and AD pathogenesis, and indicates that specific reduction of Abeta pathology can be achieved by regulation of the gamma-secretase assembly.",

    "abstract": "gamma-Secretase is a large enzyme complex comprising presenilin, nicastrin, presenilin enhancer 2, and anterior pharynx-defective 1 that mediates the intramembrane proteolysis of a large number of proteins including amyloid precursor protein and Notch. Recently, a novel gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP) was identified that interacts with gamma-secretase and the C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein to selectively increase amyloid-beta production. In this study we have further characterized the role of endogenous and exogenous GSAP in the regulation of gamma-secretase activity and amyloid-beta production in vitro. Knockdown of GSAP expression in N2a cells decreased amyloid-beta levels. In contrast, overexpression of GSAP in HEK cells expressing amyloid precursor protein or in N2a cells had no overt effect on amyloid-beta generation. Likewise, purified recombinant GSAP had no effect on amyloid-beta generation in two distinct in vitro gamma-secretase assays. In subsequent cellular studies with imatinib, a kinase inhibitor that reportedly prevents the interaction of GSAP with the C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein, a concentration-dependent decrease in amyloid-beta levels was observed. However, no interaction between GSAP and the C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein was evident in co-immunoprecipitation studies. In addition, subchronic administration of imatinib to rats had no effect on brain amyloid-beta levels. In summary, these findings suggest the roles of GSAP and imatinib in the regulation of gamma-secretase activity and amyloid-beta generation are uncertain.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of mania/hypomania and depression. Progressive cognitive dysfunction such as impairments in executive function and verbal memory is common in euthymic bipolar patients. The cerebrospinal fluid has previously been used to study neurodegenerative processes in Alzheimer's disease, from which changes in three core biomarkers have emerged as indicative of degeneration: amyloid beta, total tau, and hyperphosphorylated tau. Here, neurodegeneration in bipolar disorder was investigated by assessing the association between bipolar disorder and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for neurodegenerative processes. Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained from 139 bipolar disorder patients and 71 healthy controls. Concentrations of total and phosphorylated tau, amyloid beta1-42, amyloid beta38/beta40/beta42, and the soluble forms of amyloid precursor protein were measured in patients vs controls. The concentrations of the soluble forms of amyloid precursor protein were significantly lower in bipolar patients compared with controls. The amyloid beta42/amyloid beta38 and the amyloid beta42/amyloid beta40 ratios were higher in bipolar patients than controls. There were no discernible differences in the concentrations of total/phosphorylated tau, amyloid beta1-42, or amyloid beta38/beta40/beta42. The concentrations of the biomarkers within the bipolar patient group were further associated with different ongoing medical treatments and diagnostic subgroups. The findings suggest that the amyloid precursor protein metabolism is altered in bipolar disorder. The results may have implications for the understanding of the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder and for the development of treatment strategies. Importantly, there were no signs of an Alzheimer-like neurodegenerative process among bipolar patients.",

    "title": "Production of glycosylated soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPPalpha) in Leishmania tarentolae.",
    "abstract": "Soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPPalpha) is a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the etiologic agent in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reduced expression of sAPPalpha was previously found in the brains of AD patients, and it was suggested that sAPPalpha might counteract neurotoxic effects of Abeta, another APP cleavage product with enhanced abundance in Alzheimer's diseased brains. However, little is known about the biological functions of sAPPalpha. Thus, efficient production of this protein is a prerequisite for further studies. The unicellular eukaryotic parasite Leishmania tarentolae has recently emerged as a promising expression system for eukaryotic proteins due to its ability to posttranslationally modify proteins combined with easy cultivation and high protein yield. Interestingly, sAPPalpha produced in L. tarentolae was biologically active and glycosylated. In contrast to nonglycosylated sAPPalpha expressed in Eschericha coli, it also featured higher stability against enzymatic degradation. Detailed analysis of the glycosylation pattern of sAPPalpha produced in L. tarentolae by PGC-LC-ESI-MS/MS N-glycan analysis identified among eukaryotic species the highly conserved core pentasaccharide (Man3GlcNAc2) as being attached to Asn467 of sAPPalpha. Using oxonium ion scanning of CID-MS/MS spectra in combination with ETD fragmentation, we also identified two peptides (peptides 269-288 and 575-587) modified with N-acetyl hexosamine (HexNAc) residues. One of these O-glycosylation sites could be unambiguously assigned to Thr576 of sAPPalpha. This is the first time that O-glycosylation of a recombinant protein expressed in L. tarentolae has been demonstrated. Together, human sAPPalpha produced in L. tarentolae was N- and O-glycosylated on similar sites as described for mammalian-expressed sAPPalpha and showed similar biological activity. This demonstrates that L. tarentolae is a very suitable and simple to handle expression system for mammalian glycoproteins.",

    "abstract": "gamma-Secretase modulators (GSM), which reduce amyloidogenic Abeta(42) production while maintaining total Abeta levels, and Notch-sparing gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) are promising therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). To have a safety margin for therapeutic use, GSMs and GSIs need to allow Notch intracellular domain (NICD) production, while preventing neurotoxic Abeta peptide production. Typically, GSI and GSM effects on these substrates are determined using two different cell lines, one for the measurement of enzyme activity against each substrate. However, predicting selectivity for different substrates across cell systems may reduce the reliability of such ratios such that the in vitro data are not useful for predicting in vivo safety margins. This is especially concerning since the IC(50)'s of some GSIs vary depending upon the level of APP expression in a cell line. To circumvent this problem, we utilized the SUP-T1 cell line which expresses a truncated Notch receptor fragment that does not need sheddase cleavage to be a gamma-secretase substrate. When combined with a sensitive method of measuring Abeta production, this assay system allows both substrates to be measured simultaneously, reducing the potential to calculate imprecise selectivity margins. To demonstrate the value of this system, known GSIs and GSMs were examined in the SUP-T1 dual substrate assay. IC(50)'s were determined for both substrates and the in vitro selectivity margin was calculated. These data suggest using a single cell line is a more accurate prediction of the fold difference between NICD inhibition and Abeta(42) lowering for therapeutically promising GSIs and GSMs.",

    "abstract": "Autosomal-dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) or Presenilin (PSEN) genes. Studies from families with ADAD have been critical to support the amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer disease (AD), the basis for the current development of amyloid-based disease-modifying therapies in sporadic AD (SAD). However, whether the pathological changes in APP processing in the CNS in ADAD are similar to those observed in SAD remains unclear. In this study, we measured beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE) protein levels and activity, APP and APP C-terminal fragments in brain samples from subjects with ADAD carrying APP or PSEN1 mutations (n = 18), patients with SAD (n = 27) and age-matched controls (n = 22). We also measured sAPPbeta and BACE protein levels, as well as BACE activity, in CSF from individuals carrying PSEN1 mutations (10 mutation carriers and 7 non-carrier controls), patients with SAD (n = 32) and age-matched controls (n = 11). We found that in the brain, the pattern in ADAD was characterized by an increase in APP beta-C-terminal fragment (beta-CTF) levels despite no changes in BACE protein levels or activity. In contrast, the pattern in SAD in the brain was mainly characterized by an increase in BACE levels and activity, with less APP beta-CTF accumulation than ADAD. In the CSF, no differences were found between groups in BACE activity or expression or sAPPbeta levels. Taken together, these data suggest that the physiopathological events underlying the chronic Abeta production/clearance imbalance in SAD and ADAD are different. These differences should be considered in the design of intervention trials in AD.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide deposition into insoluble plaques is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease; soluble oligomeric Abeta has been hypothesized to more directly underlie impaired learning and memory in dementia of the Alzheimer type. However, the lack of a sensitive, specific, and quantitative assay for Abeta oligomers has hampered rigorous tests of this hypothesis. METHODS: We developed a plate-based single molecule counting fluorescence immunoassay for oligomeric Abeta sensitive to low pg/ml concentrations of synthetic Abeta dimers using the same Abeta-specific monoclonal antibody to both capture and detect Abeta. The Abeta oligomer assay does not recognize monomeric Abeta, amyloid precursor protein, or other non-Abeta peptide oligomers. RESULTS: Abeta oligomers were detected in aqueous cortical lysates from patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type and nondemented patients with Abeta plaque pathology. However, Abeta oligomer concentrations in demented patients' lysates were tightly correlated with Abeta plaque coverage (r = 0.88), but this relationship was weaker in those from nondemented patients (r = 0.30) despite equivalent Abeta plaque pathology. The ratio of Abeta oligomer levels to plaque density fully distinguished demented from nondemented patients, with no overlap between groups in this derived variable. Other Abeta and plaque measures did not distinguish demented from nondemented patients. Abeta oligomers were not detected in cerebrospinal fluid with this assay. INTERPRETATION: The results raise the intriguing hypothesis that the linkage between plaques and oligomers may be a key pathophysiological event underlying dementia of the Alzheimer type. This Abeta oligomer assay may be useful for many tests of the oligomer hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The need to recognize Alzheimer's disease (AD) as early as possible led us to evaluate the predictive value of amyloid beta(1-42) (Abeta42), total tau (tau), and phosphorylated tau (ptau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for clinical progression in patients with subjective complaints. METHODS: We recruited nondemented patients with subjective complaints (i.e., criteria for mild cognitive impairment [MCI] not fulfilled) from our memory clinic. We assessed the predictive value of CSF Abeta42, tau, and ptau for clinical progression using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, gender, and baseline findings on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Clinical progression was defined as progression to MCI or AD. RESULTS: We included 127 patients with subjective complaints (age 60 +- 10 years, 61 [48%] females, MMSE 29 +- 1). At baseline, Abeta42 and tau were abnormal in 20 patients (both 16%), and ptau in 32 patients (25%). Thirteen patients (10%) progressed to MCI (n = 11) or AD (n = 2). Abeta42 was the strongest predictor of progression to MCI or AD with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 16.0 (3.8-66.4). The adjusted HR associated with tau was 2.8 (0.9-9.2) and with ptau 2.6 (0.8-8.2). Combinations of biomarkers had a lower predictive value than Abeta42 alone. CONCLUSION: Low Abeta42 was the strongest predictor of clinical progression in patients with subjective complaints. These results are in line with the hypothesis that the cascade of pathologic events starts with deposition of Abeta42, whereas neuronal degeneration and hyperphosphorylation of tau are more downstream events, closer to clinical manifestation of AD.",

    "abstract": "gamma-Secretase plays a central role in the generation of the Alzheimer disease-causing amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) from the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is thus a major Alzheimer's disease drug target. As several other gamma-secretase substrates including Notch1 and CD44 have crucial signaling functions, an understanding of the mechanism of substrate recognition and cleavage is key for the development of APP selective gamma-secretase-targeting drugs. The gamma-secretase active site domain in its catalytic subunit presenilin (PS) 1 has been implicated in substrate recognition/docking and cleavage. Highly critical in this process is its GxGD active site motif, whose invariant glycine residues cannot be replaced without causing severe functional losses in substrate selection and/or cleavage efficiency. Here, we have investigated the contribution of the less well characterized residue x of the motif (L383 in PS1) to this function. Extensive mutational analysis showed that processing of APP was overall well-tolerated over a wide range of hydrophobic and hydrophilic mutations. Interestingly, however, most L383 mutants gave rise to reduced levels of Abeta37-39 species, and several increased the pathogenic Abeta42/43 species. Several of the Abeta42/43 -increasing mutants severely impaired the cleavages of Notch1 and CD44 substrates, which were not affected by any other L383 mutation. Our data thus establish an important, but compared with the glycine residues of the motif, overall less critical functional role for L383. We suggest that L383 and the flanking glycine residues form a spatial arrangement in PS1 that is critical for docking and/or cleavage of different gamma-secretase substrates.",

However, the origin of copper and the driving force behind its accumulation are unknown. We designed a sensitive fluorescent probe, Abeta(1-16)(Y10W), by substituting the tyrosine residue at position 10 in the hydrophilic domain of Abeta(1-42) with tryptophan. Upon mixing Cu(II), Abeta(1-16)(Y10W), and aliquots of Abeta(1-42) taken from samples incubated for different lengths of time, we found that the Cu(II) binding strength of aggregated Abeta(1-42) has been elevated by more than 2 orders of magnitude with respect to that of monomeric Abeta(1-42). Electron paramagnetic spectroscopic measurements revealed that the Abeta(1-42) aggregates, unlike their monomeric form, can seize copper from human serum albumin, an abundant copper-containing protein in brain and cerebrospinal fluid. The significantly elevated binding strength of the Abeta(1-42) aggregates can be rationalized by a Cu(II) coordination sphere constituted by three histidines from two adjacent Abeta(1-42) molecules. Our work demonstrates that the copper binding affinity of Abeta(1-42) is dependent on its aggregation state and provides new insight into how and why senile plaques accumulate copper in vivo.",

We recently reported on GSM-2, one of the second-generation GSMs, that selectively reduced brain Abeta42 level and significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits in plaque-free 5.5-month-old Tg2576 AD model mice. Here, we investigated the effects of GSM-2 on 10-, 14-, and 18-month-old mice which had age-dependent increase in amyloid plaques. Eight-day treatment with GSM-2 significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits measured by Y-maze task in the mice of any age. However, GSM-2 reduced brain soluble Abeta42 only in 10-month-old mice. In contrast, GSM-2 markedly reduced newly synthesized soluble Abeta42 in both 10- and 18-month-old mice with similar efficacy when measured using the stable isotope-labeling technique, suggesting that nascent Abeta42 plays a more significant role than plaque-associated soluble Abeta42 in the cognitive deterioration of Tg2576 mice.

    "abstract": "Passive avoidance (PA) conditioning is a fear motivated task able to initiate a cascade of altered gene expression within the hippocampus, a structure critical to learning and memory. We have previously shown that neurofibromin (NF1) and amyloid precursor protein (APP), two genes implicated in cognitive function, are differentially expressed in brain of dopamine D3 receptor knock-out mice (D(3)R(-/-)), suggesting that the receptor might have a role in their trascriptional regulation. Here in this study, we hypothesized that during acquisition of PA conditioning the expression of NF1 and APP genes could be influenced by D(3)Rs. To address this issue, we analyzed the expression of NF1 and APP in the hippocampus of both wild-type (WT) and D(3)R(-/-) mice subjected to the single trial step-through PA paradigm. Our finding demonstrated that (1) D(3)R(-/-) mice exhibit increased cognitive performance as compared to WT mice in the step-through PA trial; (2) acquisition of PA increased D(3)R and NF1, but not APP expression in WT mice hippocampus; (3) PA-driven NF1 induction in WT was abrogated in D(3)R(-/-) mice and finally that (4) the heightened basal APP expression observed in naive D(3)R(-/-) mice was totally reversed by acquisition of PA. In conclusion, the present finding show for the first time that both D(3)R and NF1 genes are upregulated following PA conditioning and suggest that hippocampal D(3)Rs might be relevant to NF1 transcriptional regulation in the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether amyloid burden, as indexed by Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) retention, identifies patients with Parkinson disease with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) compared to those with normal cognition (PD-nl). A related aim is to determine whether amyloid burden predicts cognitive decline in a cohort of subjects with PD without dementia. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we examined 46 subjects with PD without dementia, of whom 35 had normal cognition and 11 met criteria for PD-MCI at study baseline. All subjects underwent standardized neurologic and neuropsychological examinations and PiB PET at baseline, and clinical examinations were conducted annually for up to 5 years. RESULTS: At baseline, precuneus PiB retention did not distinguish PD-MCI from PD-nl. Subjects with PD-MCI declined more rapidly than PD-nl subjects on cognitive tests of memory, executive function, and activation retrieval. Of the 35 PD-nl subjects, 8 progressed to PD-MCI and 1 to dementia; of the 11 PD-MCI subjects, 5 converted to dementia. Both higher PiB retention and a diagnosis of PD-MCI predicted a greater hazard of conversion to a more severe diagnosis. Baseline PiB retention predicted worsening in executive function over time. The APOE epsilon4 allele also related to worsening in executive function, as well as visuospatial function, activation retrieval, and performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination. In contrast to its relation to cognitive decline, PiB retention did not affect progression of motor impairment. CONCLUSIONS: At baseline measurements, amyloid burden does not distinguish between cognitively impaired and unimpaired subjects with PD without dementia, but our data suggest that amyloid contributes to cognitive, but not motor, decline over time.",

    "abstract": "Using microarray technology we studied the genome-wide gene expression profiles in the frontal cortex of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and age and sex-matched littermates at the age of 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15-18 months to investigate transcriptional changes that are associated with beta amyloid protein (Abeta) plaque formation and buildup. We observed the occurrence of an immune response with glial activation, but no changes in genes involved in synaptic transmission or plasticity. Comparison of the mouse gene expression data set with a human data set representing the course of Alzheimer's disease revealed a strikingly limited overlap between gene expression in the APPswe/PS1dE9 and human Alzheimer's disease prefrontal cortex. Only plexin domain containing 2, complement component 4b, and solute carrier family 14 (urea transporter) member 1 were significantly upregulated in the mouse and human brain which might suggest a function in Abeta pathology for these 3 genes. In both data sets we detected clusters of upregulated genes involved in immune-related processes. We conclude that the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse can be a good model to study the immune response associated with cortical Abeta plaques.",

    "abstract": "SIGNIFICANCE: Alzheimer disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease. AD is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment. One of the main histopathological hallmarks of AD brain is the presence of senile plaques (SPs) and another is elevated oxidative stress. The main component of SPs is amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) that is derived from the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein. RECENT ADVANCES: Recent studies are consistent with the notion that methionine present at 35 position of Abeta is critical to Abeta-induced oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. Further, we also discuss the signatures of oxidatively modified brain proteins, identified using redox proteomics approaches, during the progression of AD. CRITICAL ISSUES: The exact relationships of the specifically oxidatively modified proteins in AD pathogenesis require additional investigation. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Further studies are needed to address whether the therapies directed toward brain oxidative stress and oxidatively modified key brain proteins might help delay or prevent the progression of AD.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in the brain vasculature results in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which occurs in about 80% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. While Abeta42 predominates parenchymal amyloid plaques in AD brain, Abeta40 is prevalent in the cerebrovascular amyloid. Dutch mutation of Abeta40 (E22Q) promotes aggressive cerebrovascular accumulation and leads to severe CAA in the mutation carriers; knowledge of how DutchAbeta40 drives this process more efficiently than Abeta40 could reveal various pathophysiological events that promote CAA. In this study we have demonstrated that DutchAbeta40 shows preferential accumulation in the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) endothelial cells due to its inefficient blood-to-brain transcytosis. Consequently, DutchAbeta40 establishes a permeation barrier in the BBB endothelium, prevents its own clearance from the brain, and promotes the formation of amyloid deposits in the cerebral microvessels. The BBB endothelial accumulation of native Abeta40 is not robust enough to exercise such a significant impact on its brain clearance. Hence, the cerebrovascular accumulation of Abeta40 is slow and may require other copathologies to precipitate into CAA. In conclusion, the magnitude of Abeta accumulation in the BBB endothelial cells is a critical factor that promotes CAA; hence, clearing vascular endothelium of Abeta proteins may halt or even reverse CAA.",

As a direct consequence, the strength of the Cu(II) to Abeta interaction, that is, the Cu(II) affinity of Abeta, is a very important parameter to determine. Because Abeta peptide contain one Tyr fluorophore in its sequence and because Cu(II) does quench Tyr fluorescence, fluorescence measurements appear to be a straightforward way to obtain this parameter. However, this proved to be wrong, mainly because of data misinterpretation in some previous studies that leads to a conflicting situation. In the present paper, we have investigated in details a large set of fluorescence data that were analyzed with a new method taking into account the presence of two Cu(II) sites and the inner-filter effect. This leads to reinterpretation of the published data and to the determination of a unified affinity value in the 10(10) M(-1) range.",

The cross-beta molecular architecture has been reported in increasing numbers of amyloid-like fibrillar systems. The Waltz algorithm is able to predict ordered self-assembly of amyloidogenic peptides by taking into account the residue type and position. This algorithm has expanded the amyloid sequence space, and in the present study we characterize the structures of amyloid-like fibrils formed by three peptides identified by Waltz that form fibrils but not crystals. The structural challenge is met by combining electron microscopy, linear dichroism, CD and X-ray fibre diffraction. We propose structures that reveal a cross-beta conformation with 'steric-zipper' features, giving insights into the role for side chains in peptide packing and stability within fibrils. The amenity of these peptides to structural characterization makes them compelling model systems to use for understanding the relationship between sequence, self-assembly, stability and structure of amyloid fibrils.",

SFN is an indirect, potent antioxidant derived from broccoli that has previously been found to stimulate the Nrf2-ARE pathway and facilitate several other cytoprotective mechanisms. In this study, administration of SFN ameliorated cognitive function of Abeta-induced AD acute mouse models in Y-maze and passive avoidance behavior tests. Interestingly, we found that the therapeutic effect of SFN did not involve inhibition of Abeta aggregation. While the exact mechanism of interaction of SFN in AD has not yet been ascertained, our results suggest that SFN can aid in cognitive impairment and may protect the brain from amyloidogenic damages.",

    "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms governing gamma-secretase cleavage specificity are not fully understood. Herein, we demonstrate that extending the transmembrane domain of the amyloid precursor protein-derived C99 substrate in proximity to the cytosolic face strongly influences gamma-secretase cleavage specificity. Sequential insertion of leucines or replacement of membrane-anchoring lysines by leucines elevated the production of Abeta42, whilst lowering production of Abeta40. A single insertion or replacement was sufficient to produce this phenotype, suggesting that the helical length distal to the epsilon-site is a critical determinant of gamma-secretase cleavage specificity. Replacing the lysine at the luminal membrane border (K28) with glutamic acid (K28E) increased Abeta37 and reduced Abeta42 production. Maintaining a positive charge with an arginine replacement, however, did not alter cleavage specificity. Using two potent and structurally distinct gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs), we elucidated the contribution of K28 to the modulatory mechanism. Surprisingly, whilst lowering the potency of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-type GSM, the K28E mutation converted a heteroaryl-type GSM to an inverse GSM. This result implies the proximal lysine is critical for the GSM mechanism and pharmacology. This region is likely a major determinant for substrate binding and we speculate that modulation of substrate binding is the fundamental mechanism by which GSMs exert their action.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationships between apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 dose and in vivo distributions of both fibrillary amyloid burden and glucose metabolism in the same Alzheimer disease dementia patients, selected for abnormal amyloid imaging. METHODS: Twenty-two APOE epsilon4 negative, 40 heterozygous, and 22 homozygous Alzheimer disease dementia patients underwent dynamic (90 minutes) [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) and static [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans. Parametric nondisplaceable binding potential images of [(11)C]PIB and standardized uptake value ratio images of [(18)F]FDG were generated using cerebellar gray matter as reference tissue. Frontal, parietal, temporal, posterior cingulate, and occipital cortices were selected as regions of interest. RESULTS: Multivariate general linear models with adjustment for age, sex, and Mini-Mental State Examination showed main effects of APOE epsilon4 dose on distributions of both [(11)C]PIB (p for trend <0.05) and [(18)F]FDG (p for trend <0.01). More specifically, a univariate general linear model of individual regions showed increased [(11)C]PIB binding in frontal cortex of APOE epsilon4 noncarriers compared with APOE epsilon4 carriers (p < 0.05). In contrast, APOE epsilon4 carriers had reduced [(18)F]FDG uptake in occipital cortex (p < 0.05) and a borderline significant effect in posterior cingulate (p = 0.07) in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: We found a reversed APOE epsilon4 dose effect for amyloid deposition in the frontal lobe, whereas APOE epsilon4 carriership was associated with more profound metabolic impairment in posterior parts of the cortex. These findings suggest that APOE genotype has a differential effect on the distribution of amyloid plaques and glucose metabolism. This may have important implications for emerging therapies that aim to directly intervene in the disease process.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the aggressive appearance of plaques of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, which result from the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the beta- and gamma-secretases. Abeta production is evaded by alternate cleavage of APP by the alpha- and gamma-secretases. Carnosic acid (CA) has been proven to activate the transcription factor Nrf2, a main regulator of the antioxidant response. We investigated the effects of CA on the production of Abeta 1-42 peptide (Abeta42) and on the expressions of the related genes in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. The treatment of cells with CA suppressed Abeta42 secretion (61% suppression at 30muM). CA treatment enhanced the mRNA expressions of an alpha-secretase TACE (tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme, also called a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17, ADAM17) significantly and another alpha-secretase ADAM10 marginally; however, the beta-secretase BACE1 (beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme-1) was not increased by CA. Knockdown of TACE by siRNA reduced soluble-APPalpha secretion enhanced by CA and partially recovered the CA-suppressed Abeta42 secretion. These results suggest that CA reduces Abeta42 production by activating TACE without promoting BACE1 in human neuroblastoma cells. The use of CA may have a potential in the prevention of Abeta-mediated diseases, particularly AD.",

    "title": "Formation of non-toxic Abeta fibrils by small heat shock protein under heat-stress conditions.",
    "abstract": "Small heat shock protein (sHsp) is a molecular chaperone with a conserved alpha-crystallin domain that can prevent protein aggregation. It has been shown that sHsps exist as oligomers (12-40 mer) and their dissociation into small dimers or oligomers is functionally important. Since several sHsps are upregulated and co-localized with amyloid-beta (Abeta) in senile plaques of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), sHsps are thought to be involved in AD. Previous studies have also shown that sHsp can prevent Abeta aggregation in vitro. However, it remains unclear how the quaternary structure of sHsp influences Abeta aggregation. In this study, we report for the first time the effect of the quaternary structure of sHsp on Abeta aggregation using sHsp from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (SpHsp16.0) showing a clear temperature-dependent structural transition between an oligomer (30  C) and dimer (50  C) state. Abeta aggregation was inhibited by the oligomeric form of SpHsp16.0. In contrast, amyloid fibrils were formed in the presence of dimeric SpHsp16.0. Interestingly, these amyloid fibrils consisted of both Abeta and SpHsp16.0 and showed a low ThT intensity and low cytotoxicity due to their low binding affinity to the cell surface. These results suggest the formation of novel fibrillar Abeta amyloid with different characteristics from that of the authentic Abeta amyloid fibrils formed in the absence of sHsp. Our results also suggest the potential protective role of sHsp in AD under stress conditions.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that the ability to form amyloid fibrils is an inherent property of the polypeptide chain. This has lead to the development of several computational approaches to predict amyloidogenicity by amino acid sequences. Here, we discuss the principles governing these methods, and evaluate them using several datasets. They deliver excellent performance in the tests made using short peptides (~6 residues). However, there is a general tendency towards a high number of false positives when tested against longer sequences. This shortcoming needs to be addressed as these longer sequences are linked to diseases. Recent structural studies have shown that the core element of the majority of disease-related amyloid fibrils is a beta-strand-loop-beta-strand motif called beta-arch. This insight provides an opportunity to substantially improve the prediction of amyloids produced by natural proteins, ushering in an era of personalized medicine based on genome analysis.",

Quantum dots (QDs) are an optimum labeling reagent for this because of their strong and steady fluorescence properties. In this paper, Abeta was labeled with QDs by a simple mixed incubation strategy, with a QD labeled Abeta complex (QDs-Abeta) being obtained. In the complex, QDs efficiently restrained the formation of beta-folding and fibrils of Abeta, while the graininess, dispersivity and fluorescence properties of the QDs hardly changed. The fluorescence microscopy imaging results showed that the astrocytes could ingest the QDs-Abeta. The QDs and Abeta did not separate from each other during the ingestion process, and the Abeta could be degraded subsequently.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of Alzheimer's disease depends on the relative abundance of different amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide species. These peptides are produced by sequential proteolytic cleavage within the transmembrane helix of the 99 residue C-terminal fragment of the amyloid precursor protein (C99) by the intramembrane protease gamma-secretase. Intramembrane proteolysis is thought to require local unfolding of the substrate helix, which has been proposed to be cleaved as a homodimer. Here, we investigated the backbone dynamics of the substrate helix. Amide exchange experiments of monomeric recombinant C99 and of synthetic transmembrane domain peptides reveal that the N-terminal Gly-rich homodimerization domain exchanges much faster than the C-terminal cleavage region. MD simulations corroborate the differential backbone dynamics, indicate a bending motion at a diglycine motif connecting dimerization and cleavage regions, and detect significantly different H-bond stabilities at the initial cleavage sites. Our results are consistent with the following hypotheses about cleavage of the substrate: First, the GlyGly hinge may precisely position the substrate within gamma-secretase such that its catalytic center must start proteolysis at the known initial cleavage sites. Second, the ratio of cleavage products formed by subsequent sequential proteolysis could be influenced by differential extents of solvation and by the stabilities of H-bonds at alternate initial sites. Third, the flexibility of the Gly-rich domain may facilitate substrate movement within the enzyme during sequential proteolysis. Fourth, dimerization may affect substrate processing by decreasing the dynamics of the dimerization region and by increasing that of the C-terminal part of the cleavage region.",

Increased knowledge gained during the past 25 years indicates that AD falls along a clinical and neuropathological spectrum represented as a continuum that extends from preclinical disease in which there are no symptoms, through early symptomatic phases, and finally to AD dementia. The Alzheimer's research community recognizes that imaging, body fluids, and cognitive biomarkers contribute to enhanced diagnostic confidence for AD. There has also been emerging consensus regarding the use of AD biomarkers in clinical trials. The use of biomarkers in clinical trials and practice is hampered by the lack of standardization. In response to the emerging need for standardization, an international meeting of AD researchers was held in Melbourne, Australia, in March 2012 to bring together key researchers, clinicians, industry, and regulatory stakeholders with the aim of generating consensus on standardization and validation of cognitive, imaging, and fluid biomarkers, as well as lifestyle parameters used in research centers worldwide.",

    "title": "Aliphatic peptides show similar self-assembly to amyloid core sequences, challenging the importance of aromatic interactions in amyloidosis.",
    "abstract": "The self-assembly of abnormally folded proteins into amyloid fibrils is a hallmark of many debilitating diseases, from Alzheimer's and Parkinson diseases to prion-related disorders and diabetes type II. However, the fundamental mechanism of amyloid aggregation remains poorly understood. Core sequences of four to seven amino acids within natural amyloid proteins that form toxic fibrils have been used to study amyloidogenesis. We recently reported a class of systematically designed ultrasmall peptides that self-assemble in water into cross-beta-type fibers. Here we compare the self-assembly of these peptides with natural core sequences. These include core segments from Alzheimer's amyloid-beta, human amylin, and calcitonin. We analyzed the self-assembly process using circular dichroism, electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, rheology, and molecular dynamics simulations. We found that the designed aliphatic peptides exhibited a similar self-assembly mechanism to several natural sequences, with formation of alpha-helical intermediates being a common feature. Interestingly, the self-assembly of a second core sequence from amyloid-beta, containing the diphenylalanine motif, was distinctly different from all other examined sequences. The diphenylalanine-containing sequence formed beta-sheet aggregates without going through the alpha-helical intermediate step, giving a unique fiber-diffraction pattern and simulation structure. Based on these results, we propose a simplified aliphatic model system to study amyloidosis. Our results provide vital insight into the nature of early intermediates formed and suggest that aromatic interactions are not as important in amyloid formation as previously postulated. This information is necessary for developing therapeutic drugs that inhibit and control amyloid formation.",

    "abstract": "Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, have been reported to attenuate amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) production in various cellular models. However, the mechanisms by which statins affect neuronal Abeta production have not yet been clarified. Here, we investigated this issue in rat primary cortical neurons using two statins, pitavastatin (PV) and atorvastatin (AV). Treatment of neurons with 0.2-2.5 muM PV or AV for 4 days induced a concentration- and time-dependent reduction in the secretion of both Abeta40 and Abeta42. Moreover, Western blot analyses of cell lysates showed that treatment with PV or AV significantly reduced expression levels of the mature form of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Thr668-phosphorylated APP (P-APP), but not immature form of APP; the decreases in P-APP levels were more notable than those of mature APP levels. The statin treatment did not alter expression of BACE1 (beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1) or gamma-secretase complex proteins (presenilin 1, nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2). In neurons overexpressing APP via recombinant adenoviruses, PV or AV similarly reduced Abeta secretion and the levels of mature APP and P-APP. Statins also markedly reduced cellular cholesterol content in neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. Co-treatment with mevalonate reversed the statin-induced decreases in Abeta secretion and mature APP and P-APP levels, whereas co-treatment with cholesterol did not, despite recovery of cellular cholesterol levels. Finally, cell-surface biotinylation experiments revealed that both statins significantly reduced the levels of cell-surface P-APP without changing those of cell surface mature APP. These results suggest that statins reduce Abeta production by selectively modulating APP maturation and phosphorylation through a mechanism independent of cholesterol reduction in cultured neurons.",

Recently, attention has turned to neuroimaging of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease in which imaging-pathological correlations can be readily performed. In this study, anatomical and arterial spin labeling perfusion magnetic resonance imaging scans of amyloid precursor protein transgenic and age-matched wild-type mice were acquired at 3, 12, and 18 months of age. Fully-automated image processing methods were used to derive quantitative measures of cortical thickness and perfusion. These studies revealed increased regional cortical thickness in young transgenic mice relative to age-matched wild-type mice. However, the transgenic mice generally demonstrated a greater rate of cortical thinning over 15 months. Cortical perfusion was significantly reduced in young transgenic mice in comparison with wild-type mice across most brain regions. Previously unreported regional genotype differences and age-related changes in cortical thickness and cerebral perfusion were identified in amyloid precursor protein transgenic and wild-type mice.",

The consortium brings together representatives of academic centers, industry, and the regulatory community with the common goal of developing internationally accepted common reference standards and reference methods for the assessment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta42 (Abeta42) and tau biomarkers. Such standards are essential to ensure that analytical measurements are reproducible and consistent across multiple laboratories and across multiple kit manufacturers. Analytical harmonization for CSF Abeta42 and tau will help reduce confusion in the AD community regarding the absolute values associated with the clinical interpretation of CSF biomarker results and enable worldwide comparison of CSF biomarker results across AD clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that results in cognitive impairment. It has been proposed that deposits of beta-amyloid (Abeta) form the cores of the plaque and, subsequently, induce the activation of GSK-3beta and the hyperphosphorylation of tau, resulting in cognitive impairment. Oxidative stress has been proposed to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of AD. Cyanidin 3-O-glucoside (Cy3G) is a neuroprotective antioxidant. However, the effects of Cy3G on cognition are unclear. In this paper, we show that Cy3G is protective against the Abeta-induced impairment of learning and memory, but has no effect on normal learning and memory. Moreover, we found that Gy3G attenuated the Abeta-induced tau hyperphosphorylation and GSK-3beta hyperactivation observed in AD. Taken together, these results demonstrated that Cy3G can rescue the cognitive impairments that are induced by Abeta via the modulation of GSK-3beta/tau, suggesting a potential therapeutic role of Cy3G in AD.",

    "title": "Leptin regulates amyloid beta production via the gamma-secretase complex.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease, affecting an estimated 5.3million people in the United States. While many factors likely contribute to AD progression, it is widely accepted that AD is driven by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta), a small, fibrillogenic peptide generated by the sequential proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein by the beta- and gamma-secretases. Though the underlying causes of Abeta accumulation in sporadic AD are myriad, it is clear that lifestyle and overall health play a significant role. The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin has varied systemic affects, including neuropeptide release and neuroprotection. A recent study by Lieb et al. (2009) showed that individuals with low plasma leptin levels are at greater risk of developing AD, through unknown mechanisms. In this report, we show that plasma leptin is a strong negative predictor of Abeta levels in the mouse brain, supporting a protective role for the hormone in AD onset. We also show that the inhibition of Abeta accumulation is due to the downregulation of transcription of the gamma-secretase components. On the other hand, beta-secretase expression is either unchanged (BACE1) or increased (BACE2). Finally, we show that only presenilin 1 (PS1) is negatively correlated with plasma leptin at the protein level (p<0.0001). These data are intriguing and may highlight a role for leptin in regulating the onset of amyloid pathology and AD.",

The 3xTgAD mouse model was used to test the hypothesis that a ketone ester-based diet can ameliorate AD pathogenesis. Beginning at a presymptomatic age, 2 groups of male 3xTgAD mice were fed a diet containing a physiological enantiomeric precursor of ketone bodies (KET) or an isocaloric carbohydrate diet. The results of behavioral tests performed at 4 and 7 months after diet initiation revealed that KET-fed mice exhibited significantly less anxiety in 2 different tests. 3xTgAD mice on the KET diet also exhibited significant, albeit relatively subtle, improvements in performance on learning and memory tests. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that KET-fed mice exhibited decreased Abeta deposition in the subiculum, CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, and the amygdala. KET-fed mice exhibited reduced levels of hyperphosphorylated tau deposition in the same regions of the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. Thus, a novel ketone ester can ameliorate proteopathic and behavioral deficits in a mouse AD model.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have proposed that depression may increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), even in patients with early-onset depression. Although metabolism of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in elderly depression received attention in terms of their correlation, there is a serious heterogeneity in elderly depression in terms of age at onset of depression. Moreover, it is unknown whether early-onset major depressive disorder (MDD) has a long-term effect on the involvement of Abeta metabolism and later development of AD. Thus, we evaluated serum Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels, the Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio in 89 elderly (>=60 years of age) inpatients with MDD and 81 age-matched healthy controls, and compared them among patients with early-onset (<60 years) and late-onset (>=60years) MDD and controls. The results showed that the serum Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio was significantly higher in patients with both early- and late-onset MDD than in controls (early-onset, p=0.010; late-onset, p=0.043), and it is of great interest that the serum Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio was negatively correlated with the age at MDD onset (R=-0.201, p=0.032). These results suggest that an earlier onset of MDD may have a more serious abnormality in Abeta metabolism, possibly explaining a biological mechanism underlying the link between depression and AD.",

    "abstract": "ss-Amyloid (Ass) immunotherapy has become a promising strategy for reducing the level of Ass in brain. New immunological approaches have been recently proposed for rapid, early diagnosis, and molecular treatment of neurodegenerative diseases related to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The combination of proteolytic epitope excision and extraction and mass spectrometry using digestion with various proteases has been shown to be an efficient tool for the identification and molecular characterization of antigenic determinants. Here, we report the identification of the Abeta epitope recognized by the variable domain of single chain llama anti-Abeta-antibodies, termed Abeta-nanobodies, that have been discovered in the blood of camelids and found to be promising candidates for immunotherapy of AD. The epitope recognized by two Abeta-specific nanobodies was identified by proteolytic epitope extraction- and excision-mass spectrometry using a series of proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, GluC-protease, and LysC-protease). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization--mass spectrometric analysis of the affinity--elution fraction provided the epitope, Abeta(17-28), in the mid- to carboxy-terminal domain of Abeta, which has been shown to exert an Ass-fibril inhibiting effect. Affinity studies of the synthetic epitope confirmed that the Abeta(17-28) peptide is the minimal fragment that binds to the nanobodies. The interactions between the nanobodies and full length Abeta(1-40) or Abeta-peptides containing or lacking the epitope sequence were further characterized by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and bioaffinity analysis. Determinations of binding affinities between the Abeta-nanobodies and Abeta(1-40) and the Abeta(17-28) epitope provided K(D) values of approximately 150 and 700 nmol, respectively. Thus, the knowledge of the epitope may be highly useful for future studies of Abeta-aggregation (oligomerization and fibril formation) and for designing new aggregation inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "The development and progression of Alzheimer's disease is linked to excessive production of toxic amyloid-beta peptide, initiated by beta-secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). In contrast, soluble APPalpha (sAPPalpha) generated by the alpha-secretase is known to stimulate dendritic branching and enhance synaptic function. Regulation of APP processing, and the shift from neurotrophic to neurotoxic APP metabolism remains poorly understood, but the cellular localization of APP and its interaction with various receptors is considered important. We here identify sortilin as a novel APP interaction partner. Like the related APP receptor SorLA, sortilin is highly expressed in the CNS, but whereas SorLA mainly colocalizes with APP in the soma, sortilin interacts with APP in neurites. The presence of sortilin promotes alpha-secretase cleavage of APP, unlike SorLA, which inhibits the generation of all soluble products. Also, sortilin and SorLA both bind and mediate internalization of sAPP but to different cellular compartments. The interaction involves the 6A domain of APP, present in both neuronal and non-neuronal APP isoforms. This is important as sAPP receptors described so far only bind the non-neuronal isoforms, leaving SorLA and sortilin as the only receptors for sAPP generated by neurons. Together, our findings establish sortilin, as a novel APP interaction partner that influences both production and cellular uptake of sAPP.",

Among other functions, APOE is proposed to sequester neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain, delivering them to cellular catabolism via neuronal APOE receptors. Still, the receptors involved in this process remain controversial. Here, we identified the pro-neurotrophin receptor sortilin as major endocytic pathway for clearance of APOE/Abeta complexes in neurons. Sortilin binds APOE with high affinity. Lack of receptor expression in mice results in accumulation of APOE and of Abeta in the brain and in aggravated plaque burden. Also, primary neurons lacking sortilin exhibit significantly impaired uptake of APOE/Abeta complexes despite proper expression of other APOE receptors. Despite higher than normal brain APOE levels, sortilin-deficient animals display anomalies in brain lipid metabolism (e.g., accumulation of sulfatides) seen in APOE-deficient mice, indicating functional deficiency in cellular APOE uptake pathways. Together, our findings identified sortilin as an essential neuronal pathway for APOE-containing lipoproteins in vivo and suggest an intriguing link between Abeta catabolism and pro-neurotrophin signaling converging on this receptor.",

    "abstract": "Impairments in Abeta removal are increasingly being considered as a possible cause for the abnormal Abeta build-up typical of Alzheimer disease. Of particular interest is a pool of Abeta that accumulates intraneuronally and may contribute to neuronal toxicity. The mechanism for intraneuronal accumulation, however, is not well understood and is commonly attributed to impaired removal of extracellular Abeta by neurons. Based on the intracellular distribution of the well established Abeta degrading enzymes, ECE-1 and ECE-2, we tested whether impairments in their catalytic activity could lead to intracellular Abeta accumulation. Using SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing wild-type amyloid precursor protein and pharmacological inhibition of endogenous ECE activity, we found that ECEs participate in the degradation of at least two distinct pools of Abeta; one destined for secretion and the other being produced and degraded within the endosomal-autophagic-lysosomal pathways. Although ECE-1 regulates both pools of Abeta, ECE-2 regulates mainly the intracellular pool of the peptide. Consistent with this result, ECE-2 was found to co-localize with markers of the endosomal/lysosomal pathway but not with a trans-Golgi network marker. Furthermore, ECE-2 was detected in autophagic vesicles in cells treated with chloroquine. Under these conditions, ECE inhibition produced significantly higher elevations in intracellular Abeta than chloroquine treatment alone. This study highlights the existence of Abeta clearance mechanisms by ECEs at intracellular sites of production. Alterations in ECE activity may be considered as a cause for increased intraneuronal Abeta in Alzheimer disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is widely recognized as a key factor in the pathogenesis of AD. Abeta1-42 a major component of amyloid plaques, has shown synaptotoxicity associated with impaired long-term potentiation and cognitive deficits. Alteration of neurogenesis in AD patients has been reported, while little is known about how Abeta1-42 affects hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult brain. In this study, we injected human Abeta1-42 peptide into hippocampal CA1 area of adult mouse brain bilaterally and evaluated histological change and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain showed that Abeta1-42-injection resulted in an extensive neurodegeneration in the Abeta-accumulated area and CA3 in hippocampus. Immunostaining showed that intrahippocampal Abeta1-42-injection dramatically decreased the number of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) compared to the vehicle injection. Moreover, a significant decrease in the number of BrdU/double-cortin double-positive cells in Abeta1-42-injected hippocampus was observed, suggesting that Abeta1-42-injection inhibited progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis in subgranular zone of the DG in the adult brain. We also found that the Abeta1-42-mediated decline of neurogenesis was associated with decreased protein levels of cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) in the hippocampus. These results suggest that Abeta1-42 inhibits hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult brain possibly through down-regulation of INF-gamma and NF-kappaB signaling pathway. This study provides a new insight into Abeta1-42-mediated decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis in the adult central nervous system.",

The aims of this investigation were to evaluate whether the amyloid hypothesis has been tested clinically, and to explore whether preclinical data are predictive of clinical Abeta effects. METHODS: A model-based-meta analysis on Abeta levels and drug exposure over time was performed on published and in-house (pre-)clinical data with gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs; semagacestat, avagacestat, begacestat, PF-3074014, and MK0752). RESULTS: The clinical data available did not show any significant or robust reduction of CNS Abeta over time at dose levels intended for AD patients. In contrast, these doses resulted in an average increase in plasma Abeta levels over a 24-h interval. A general agreement between preclinical and clinical data was found and allowed for interspecies extrapolations. CONCLUSIONS: More substantially, CNS Abeta-lowering drugs are needed to test whether inhibition of Abeta production is efficacious in mild AD. Predictions based on preclinical data could assist in the selection of drug candidates and trial design.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in our understanding of events underlying neurodegeneration across the central and peripheral nervous systems have highlighted the critical role that synapses play in the initiation and progression of neuronal loss. With the development of increasingly accurate and versatile animal models of neurodegenerative disease it has become apparent that disruption of synaptic form and function occurs comparatively early, preceding the onset of degenerative changes in the neuronal cell body. Yet, despite our increasing awareness of the importance of synapses in neurodegeneration, the mechanisms governing the particular susceptibility of distal neuronal processes are only now becoming clear. In this review we bring together recent developments in our understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating synaptic vulnerability. We have placed a particular focus on three major areas of research that have gained significant interest over the last few years: (i) the contribution of synaptic mitochondria to neurodegeneration; (ii) the contribution of pathways that modulate synaptic function; and (iii) regulation of synaptic degeneration by local posttranslational modifications such as ubiquitination. We suggest that targeting these organelles and pathways may be a productive way to develop synaptoprotective strategies applicable to a range of neurodegenerative conditions.",

In addition, western blot analysis, Gel electromobility shift assay, immunostaining, immunofluorescence staining, ELISA and enzyme activity assays were used to examine the degree of Abeta deposition in the brains of Tg2576 mice. The Morris water maze task was analyzed using two-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Otherwise were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post hoc test. RESULTS: Treatment of HPB242 (5 mg/kg for 1 month) significantly attenuated cognitive impairments in Tg2576 transgenic mice. HPB242 also prevented amyloidogenesis in Tg2576 transgenic mice brains. This can be evidenced by Abeta accumulation, BACE1, APP and C99 expression and beta-secretase activity. In addition, HPB242 suppresses the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) as well as activation of astrocytes and microglial cells. Furthermore, activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1/3 (STAT1/3) in the brain was potently inhibited by HPB242. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, these results suggest that HPB242 might be useful to intervene in development or progression of neurodegeneration in AD through its anti-inflammatory and anti-amyloidogenic effects.",

    "title": "Ethanol reduces amyloid aggregation in vitro and prevents toxicity in cell lines.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) alters cognitive functions. A mixture of soluble beta-amyloid aggregates (Abeta) are known to act as toxic agents. It has been suggested that moderate alcohol intake reduces the development of neurodegenerative diseases, but the molecular mechanisms leading to this type of prevention have been elusive. We show the ethanol effect in the generation of complex Abeta in vitro and the impact on the viability of two cell lines. METHODS: The effect of ethanol on the kinetics of beta-amyloid aggregation in vitro was assessed by turbimetry. Soluble- and ethanol-treated beta-amyloid were added to the cell lines HEK and PC-12 to compare their effects on metabolic activity using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. In addition, we used molecular modeling to assess the impact of exposure to ethanol on the structure of beta-amyloid. RESULTS: Exposure to soluble beta-amyloid was toxic to both cell lines; however, exposing the cells to beta-amyloid aggregated in 10 mmol ethanol prevented the effect. In silico modeling suggested that ethanol alters the dynamics for assembling Abeta by disrupting a critical salt bridge between residues Asp 23 and Lys 28, required for amyloid dimerization. Thus, ethanol prevented the formation of complex short (~100 nm) Abeta, which are related to higher cell toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Ethanol prevents the formation of stable Abeta dimers in vitro, thus protecting the cells maintained in culture. Accordingly, in silico modelling predicts that soluble beta-amyloid molecules do not form stable multimers when exposed to ethanol.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current research has indicated that small natural compounds could interfere with beta-amyloid fibril growth and have the ability to disassemble preformed folded structures. Ferulic acid (FA), which possesses both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties and binds to peptides/proteins, is a potential candidate against amyloidogenesis. The molecular mechanisms connected to this action have not been elucidated in detail yet. METHODS: Here the effects of FA on preformed fibrils are investigated by means of a concerted experimental-computational approach. Spectroscopic techniques, such as FTIR, fluorescence, size exclusion chromatography and confocal microscopy in combination with molecular dynamics simulations are used to identify those features which play a key role in the destabilization of the aggregates. RESULTS: Experimental findings highlight that FA has disruptive effects on the fibrils. The computational analysis suggests that dissociation of peptides from the amyloid superstructures could take place along the fibril axis and be primarily determined by the cooperative rupture of the backbone hydrogen bonds and of the Asp-Lys salt bridges. CONCLUSION: FA clusters could induce a sort of stabilization and tightening of the fibril structure in the short term and its disruption in the long term, inhibiting further fibril re-assembly through FA screening effects. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The combination of experimental and computational techniques could be successfully used to identify the disrupting action of FA on preformed Abeta fibrils in water solution.",

    "abstract": "The APP/PS1 double transgenic mouse is an Alzheimer's Disease-like model. However, cognitive deficits measured at one age do not necessarily indicate age-related progressions. Further, results of the most widely used behavioral assessment, water maze performance, are generally limited to 1-2 endpoints. Here, male APP/PS1 and noncarrier wildtypes (n=11/group) were assessed at 7-15 months of age for water maze, open field, and motor coordination performance. Body weights and motor coordination were comparable for both groups throughout. Beginning at approximately 9 months of age, the transgenic group exhibited hypoactivity in the open field which continued throughout. Latency to locate the platform and swim path length were longer in the transgenic group; however, these appeared to be more related to increased floating and thigmotactic behavior and only partially related to a cognitive impairment. Age-related decrements in performance were not substantial; however, substantial plaque numbers were measured in six representative 16-month-old transgenic mice. The stability of water maze performance may be related to the longitudinal testing and repetitive experience, which previous research has demonstrated can confer beneficial effects on behavior and plaque deposition in transgenic Alzheimer's Disease models [1]. These results emphasize the importance of measuring multiple water maze endpoints and demonstrate the feasibility of longitudinal assessments in this model.",

    "title": "Effects of beta-sheet breaker peptides on altered responses of thoracic aorta in rats' Alzheimer's disease model induced by intraamygdaloid Abeta40.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by vascular dysfunction, in addition to memory impairment. Previously we found that beta-sheet breaker peptides (betaSBPs) improved memory impairment induced by amyloid beta-peptide Abeta40. In this study we investigated betaSBP effects on vascular responses in a rat model of AD. MAIN METHODS: AD model was induced by bilateral injection of aged Abeta40 (3 nmol) into the amygdala. betaSBPs 15-22, 16-23 and 17-24 (30 nmol) were injected into the amygdala 8 days after Abeta40. The Abeta40 deposits were examined immunohistochemically in cerebral vessels and thoracic aorta. The effects on high-K(+) contractility, phenylephrine (PE) contractility, acetylcholine (ACh) relaxation and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) relaxation were investigated in isolated thoracic aorta. Nitric oxide (NO) level in serum was investigated 14 days after Abeta40. KEY FINDINGS: Abeta40 was localized and it induced vascular damage in minute and small perforating cerebral vascular endothelium, and tunica intima (endothelial) and media (smooth muscle cells) of the thoracic aorta. In intact aorta, ACh-relaxation was decreased by Abeta40, an effect reduced by betaSBPs 15-22 and 16-23. In denuded aorta, Abeta40 decreased PE-contractility. betaSBP15-22 increased ACh-relaxation, whereas betaSBP17-24 increased K(+)-contraction. Abeta40 decreased NO, an effect inhibited by the betaSBP15-22. SIGNIFICANCE: These results provide evidence that Abeta40-perverted endothelium-dependent relaxation and decreased serum NO in AD rats were improved differentially by the betaSBP15-22. These results show the ability of Abeta40 to alter vascular responses. betaSBPs appear to be promising candidate for prevention of these consequences and therapy of AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) has been proposed as the main cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Vitamin K deficiency has been linked to the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, 15 synthesized vitamin K3 (VK3) analogues were studied for their anti-amyloidogenic activity. METHODS: Biological and spectroscopic assays were used to characterize the effect of VK3 analogues on amyloidogenic properties of Abeta, such as aggregation, free radical formation, and cell viability. Molecular dynamics simulation was used to calculate the binding affinity and mode of VK3 analogue binding to Abeta. RESULTS: Both numerical and experimental results showed that several VK3 analogues, including VK3-6, VK3-8, VK3-9, VK3-10, and VK3-224 could effectively inhibit Abeta aggregation and conformational conversion. The calculated inhibition constants were in the muM range for VK3-10, VK3-6, and VK3-9 which was similar to the IC50 of curcumin. Cell viability assays indicated that VK3-9 could effectively reduce free radicals and had a protective effect on cytotoxicity induced by Abeta. CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly demonstrated that VK3 analogues could effectively inhibit Abeta aggregation and protect cells against Abeta induced toxicity. Modified VK3 analogues can possibly be developed as effective anti-amyloidogenic drugs for the treatment of AD. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: VK3 analogues effectively inhibit Abeta aggregation and are highly potent as anti-amyloidogenic drugs for therapeutic treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E (Apo-E) is a major cholesterol carrier that supports lipid transport and injury repair in the brain. APOE polymorphic alleles are the main genetic determinants of Alzheimer disease (AD) risk: individuals carrying the epsilon4 allele are at increased risk of AD compared with those carrying the more common epsilon3 allele, whereas the epsilon2 allele decreases risk. Presence of the APOE epsilon4 allele is also associated with increased risk of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and age-related cognitive decline during normal ageing. Apo-E-lipoproteins bind to several cell-surface receptors to deliver lipids, and also to hydrophobic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, which is thought to initiate toxic events that lead to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration in AD. Apo-E isoforms differentially regulate Abeta aggregation and clearance in the brain, and have distinct functions in regulating brain lipid transport, glucose metabolism, neuronal signalling, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial function. In this Review, we describe current knowledge on Apo-E in the CNS, with a particular emphasis on the clinical and pathological features associated with carriers of different Apo-E isoforms. We also discuss Abeta-dependent and Abeta-independent mechanisms that link Apo-E4 status with AD risk, and consider how to design effective strategies for AD therapy by targeting Apo-E.",

    "abstract": "Because amyloid precursor protein (APP) fragments exist in many tissues throughout the body, including the fluid compartments of blood, they have been the focus of numerous investigations into their potential as a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease. Using immunohistochemistry, immunoelectron microscopy, Western blot, and quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis we examined whether APP processing in leukocytes is analogous to APP processing in the brain. We show APP immunoreactivity at light and electron microscopic levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) yet our Western blot analysis data demonstrated that brain and PBL contain different APP fragments and differentially expressed APP processing enzymes. A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase domain 10 (ADAM10), nicastrin, and beta-secretase 2 (BACE2) were present in brain but were undetected in PBL. Presenilin 1 and beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) were detected in both tissues but showed different patterns in Western blots. Quantitative PCR results identified Neprilysin as the only processing enzyme we interrogated in which Western and quantitative PCR data coincided. Although our data on differential processing of APP in brain and PBL point to exercising caution when generalizing between blood and brain with regard to mechanisms, they have no implications regarding utility as biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of plagues of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The redox-active Cu and Fe complexes of Abeta can cause damage to the neurons potentially via reactive oxygen species (ROS). The significant metal-mediated oxidative activity of CuAbeta suggests that its presence can be chemically devastating regardless whether it is a cause or a result of AD. Flavonoids exhibit various benefits to human health, attributable to their metal-binding and antioxidation activities to certain extents. Despite broad interests and extensive studies of their metal-binding properties and anti/pro-oxidation activities, these properties and the mechanisms of the activities toward metal-centered oxidation reactions have not been fully revealed and concluded. We report herein distinctive antioxidation mechanisms between two flavonoid families toward the oxidation reactions by CuAbeta(1-20), wherein the flavonols quercetin (Qr) and myricetin (Mr) competitively inhibit the oxidation of catechol by CuAbeta(1-20) with K(i) of 11.2 and 32.6 muM, respectively, whereas the flavanols catechin (Ct) and epicatechin (Et) are substrates with k(cat) = 1.01 x 10(-2) and 1.55 x 10(-3) s(-1) and K(m) = 0.94 and 0.55 mM, respectively. Qr has a nearly 10-fold higher antioxidative efficacy than Ct against the oxidation activity of CuAbeta, while Ct is effectively oxidized, which further decreases its antioxidant capacity. Similar inhibition patterns are observed toward oxidation of the catecholamine neurotransmitter dopamine by CuAbeta(1-20). Metal ions and CuAbeta bind Qr with a 1:1 ratio under our experimental conditions through the alpha-ketoenolate moiety as determined by the use of Co(2+) and Yb(3+) as paramagnetic NMR probes. Unlike flavanols, which are merely suicide antioxidative substrates, flavonols bind to the metal center and prevent metal-mediated redox reactions. We suggest flavonols may serve as leads for drug discovery and/or as agents toward preventing metal-mediated oxidative stress due to AD and other disorders. Moreover, CuAbeta shows 8.6- and 4.2-fold higher kinetic regioselectivity in terms of k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m), respectively, toward the peroxidation of Ct than that of the enantiomer Et, suggesting potential development of metallo-catalysts in regioselective catalysis by the use of metallopeptides as templates.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to validate new assays for measurement of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma specimens in clinical studies of solanezumab according to current regulatory recommendations. Four assays based on the INNOTEST  beta-AMYLOID(1-42) and prototype INNOTEST beta-AMYLOID(1-40) kits were developed and validated. To render these assays 'solanezumab-tolerant', excess drug was added to calibrators, quality control, and test samples via a 2-fold dilution with kit diluent. Validation parameters were evaluated by repeated testing of human CSF and EDTA-plasma pools containing solanezumab. Calibration curve correlation coefficients for the four assays were >=0.9985. Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation for Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 were <=13 and <=15%, respectively for both matrices. Dilutional linearity, within and between assays, was demonstrated for both analytes in CSF and plasma at clinically relevant dilution factors. This dilution regimen was successfully applied during Phase 3 clinical sample analysis. Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 were stable in CSF and plasma containing solanezumab at 2-8 C and room temperature for up to 8 h and during 5 additional freeze-thaw cycles from <=-20 and <=-70 C. Results of parallel tests on stored clinical samples using INNOTEST methods and proprietary ELISA methods were closely correlated (r2 > 0.9), although bias in reported concentrations was observed between assays. In conclusion, the modified INNOTEST assays provided (relatively) accurate and precise quantification of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 in CSF and plasma containing solanezumab according to established consensus validation criteria. The clinical experience with these assays post validation has shown them to be robust and reliable.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is recognized as one of the earliest and most intense pathological processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the antioxidant vitamin E has been shown to efficiently prevent amyloid plaque formation and neurodegeneration. Plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) has a major role in vitamin E transfers in vivo, and PLTP deficiency in mice is associated with reduced brain vitamin E levels. To determine the impact of PLTP on amyloid pathology in vivo, we analyzed the vulnerability of PLTP-deficient (PLTP-KO) mice to the toxic effects induced by intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric amyloid-beta 25-35 (Abeta 25-35) peptide, a non-transgenic model of AD. Under basal conditions, PLTP-KO mice showed increased cerebral oxidative stress, increased brain Abeta 1-42 levels, and a lower expression of the synaptic function marker synaptophysin, as compared with wild-type mice. This PLTP-KO phenotype was associated with increased memory impairment 1 week after Abeta25-35 peptide injection. Restoration of brain vitamin E levels in PLTP-KO mice through a chronic dietary supplementation prevented Abeta 25-35-induced memory deficits and reduced cerebral oxidative stress and toxicity. We conclude that PLTP, through its ability to deliver vitamin E to the brain, constitutes an endogenous neuroprotective agent. Increasing PLTP activity may offer a new way to develop neuroprotective therapies.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid peptides, Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42, represent major molecular targets to develop potential drugs and diagnostic tools for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In fact, oligomeric and fibrillar aggregates generated by these peptides are amongst the principal components of amyloid plaques found post mortem in patients suffering from AD. Rosmarinic acid has been demonstrated to be effective in preventing the aggregation of amyloid peptides in vitro and to delay the progression of the disease in animal models. Nevertheless, no information is available about its molecular mechanism of action. Herein, we report the NMR characterization of the interaction of Salvia sclareoides extract and that of its major component, rosmarinic acid, with Abeta1-42 peptide, whose oligomers have been described as the most toxic Abeta species in vivo. Our data shed light on the structural determinants of rosmarinic acid-Abeta1-42 oligomers interaction, thus allowing the elucidation of its mechanism of action. They also provide important information for the rational design of new compounds with higher affinity for Abeta peptides to generate new anti-amyloidogenic molecules and/or molecular tools for the specific targeting of amyloid aggregates in vivo. In addition, we identified methyl caffeate, another natural compound present in different plants and human diet, as a good ligand of Abeta1-42 oligomers, which also shows anti-amyloidogenic activity. Finally, we demonstrated the possibility to exploit STD-NMR and trNOESY experiments to screen extracts from natural sources for the presence of Abeta peptide ligands.",

    "title": "Mifepristone alters amyloid precursor protein processing to preclude amyloid beta and also reduces tau pathology.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increased circulating glucocorticoids are features of both aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and increased glucocorticoids accelerate the accumulation of AD pathologies. Here, we analyzed the effects of the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone (RU486) in the 3xTg-AD mouse model at an age where hippocampal damage leads to high circulating corticosterone levels. METHODS: The effects of mifepristone were investigated in 3xTg-AD mice using a combination of biochemical, histological, and behavior analyses. RESULTS: Mifepristone treatment rescues the pathologically induced cognitive impairments and markedly reduces amyloid beta (Abeta)-load and levels, as well as tau pathologies. Analysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing revealed concomitant decreases in both APP C-terminal fragments C99 and C83 and the appearance of a larger 17-kDa C-terminal fragment. Hence, mifepristone induces a novel C-terminal cleavage of APP that prevents it being cleaved by alpha- or beta-secretase, thereby precluding Abeta generation in the central nervous system; this cleavage and the production of the 17-kDa APP fragment was generated by a calcium-dependent cysteine protease. In addition, mifepristone treatment also reduced the phosphorylation and accumulation of tau, concomitant with reductions in p25. Notably, deficits in cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein signaling were restored with the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These preclinical results point to a potential therapeutic role for mifepristone as an effective treatment for AD and further highlight the impact the glucocorticoid system has as a regulator of Abeta generation.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. Blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and impaired permeability are implicated in the pathological process of AD, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) plays a critical role in regulating vascular functions, including vascular barrier permeability. The expression patterns and functions of KLF2 in AD progress are still unknown. In the current study, we investigated whether alterations in KLF2 contribute to cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD. Our results demonstrated that decreased expression level of KLF2 in the brains of Tg2576 transgenic mice was due to accumulation of Abeta. Importantly, overexpression of KLF2 could completely rescue impaired expression of tight junction protein Occludin induced by Abeta(1-42) in primary human brain endothelial cells (HBMECs). At last, p53 was verified to mediate Abeta(1-42) induced reduction of KLF2. Overall, this is the first time to report that KLF2 is involved in cerebrovascular dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Prolonged diet induced obesity has minimal effects towards brain pathology in mouse model of cerebral amyloid angiopathy: implications for studying obesity-brain interactions in mice.",
    "abstract": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) occurs in nearly every individual with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down's syndrome, and is the second largest cause of intracerebral hemorrhage. Mouse models of CAA have demonstrated evidence for increased gliosis contributing to CAA pathology. Nearly two thirds of Americans are overweight or obese, with little known about the effects of obesity on the brain, although increasingly the vasculature appears to be a principle target of obesity effects on the brain. In the current study we describe for the first time whether diet induced obesity (DIO) modulates glial reactivity, amyloid levels, and inflammatory signaling in a mouse model of CAA. In these studies we identify surprisingly that DIO does not significantly increase Abeta levels, astrocyte (GFAP) or microglial (IBA-1) gliosis in the CAA mice. However, within the hippocampal gyri a localized increase in reactive microglia were increased in the CA1 and stratum oriens relative to CAA mice on a control diet. DIO was observed to selectively increase IL-6 in CAA mice, with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha not increased in CAA mice in response to DIO. Taken together, these data show that prolonged DIO has only modest effects towards Abeta in a mouse model of CAA, but appears to elevate some localized microglial reactivity within the hippocampal gyri and selective markers of inflammatory signaling. These data are consistent with the majority of the existing literature in other models of Abeta pathology, which surprisingly show a mixed profile of DIO effects towards pathological processes in mouse models of neurodegenerative disease. The importance for considering the potential impact of ceiling effects in pathology within mouse models of Abeta pathogenesis, and the current experimental limitations for DIO in mice to fully replicate metabolic dysfunction present in human obesity, are discussed.

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) accumulation is one of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and plays a crucial role in its pathogenesis. Cellular models whereby amyloid precursor protein (APP) is highly expressed are commonly used to test the efficacy of novel neuroprotective compounds. In addition to Abeta, it is known that mutation in the protein presenilin contributes to early onset AD. Recently, a cellular neuroblastoma model where both APP and presenilin are expressed has become available. Since protective effects of nicotine against various neurotoxins have been observed, this study was designed to determine whether nicotine would also protect against cellular damage induced by APP or APP and presenilin. Wild type neuroblastoma (N2a) cell line, and those transfected with amyloid precursor protein (APP), and the combination of APP and presenilin were pretreated with various concentrations of nicotine and the survivability of the cells were determined by MTT assay. Nicotine dose dependently provided protection against cellular loss in all cell lines, with highest protection in the double transfected (44%) followed by single transfected (30%), and wild type (21%). The effects of nicotine in turn were blocked by mecamylamine, a non-selective nicotinic antagonist. These results suggest differential sensitivity of cell lines representing AD pathology to the protective effects of nicotine and provide further support of therapeutic potential of nicotinic agonists in at least a subtype of AD patients.",

    "title": "Early selective vulnerability of synapses and synaptic mitochondria in the hippocampal CA1 region of the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Increasing experimental evidence indicates that synaptic alterations play a key role in cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Functional and structural synaptic changes progressively take place, beginning in the early phase of AD, mainly triggered by intracellular accumulation of soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers. These peptides also accumulate within mitochondria, heavily affecting their function and morphology, particularly in synaptic compartments. To better understand the role of mitochondrial impairment in synaptic alterations during the early stages of AD, a morphological investigation was performed by means of electron microscopy in the hippocampus of 3 month-old Tg2576 and transgene-negative littermate mice. In the stratum moleculare of CA1 pyramidal cells (SMCA1) of transgenic animals compared to controls, we found significantly larger and less numerous synapses, with a significantly reduced fraction of the perforated subtype, as well as significantly smaller and more numerous mitochondria. In contrast, no differences between the two groups of mice were found in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. The reduction of synaptic contacts in SMCA1 indicates a precocious vulnerability of this region, and the synaptic enlargement may reflect a compensating process aimed at maintaining the overall contact density. Accordingly, mitochondrial modifications may represent a plastic reactive phenomenon aimed at sustaining the increased energy needs for synaptic remodeling, since mitochondrial morphology was perfectly preserved and smaller mitochondria are metabolically more efficient. Thus, morphological changes occurring at synaptic level in SMCA1 of 3 month-old Tg2576 mice might reflect a precocious vulnerability associated with a residual plastic reactivity which may slow down functional alterations.",

The present study aimed to establish a panel of plasma proteins that accurately distinguishes early AD from physiological aging and to compare the findings with previous reports. Fifty-eight healthy controls (CON) and 109 patients with AD dementia were randomly split into a training (40%) and a test (60%) sample. Significant proteins to differentiate between the CON and AD dementia groups were identified in a comprehensive panel of 107 plasma analytes in the training sample; the accuracy in differentiating these 2 groups was explored in the test sample. A set of 5 plasma proteins was identified, which differentiated between the CON group and the AD dementia group with a sensitivity of 89.36% and a specificity of 79.17%. A biological pathway analysis showed that 4 of 5 proteins belonged to a common network with amyloid precursor protein and tau. Apolipoprotein E was the only protein that was both significant in the present report and in a previous proteomic study.

    "title": "Mechanisms for the Insertion of Toxic, Fibril-like beta-Amyloid Oligomers into the Membrane.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers destabilize cellular ionic homeostasis, mediating Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is still unclear whether the mechanism (i) is mediated by cell surface receptors; (ii) is direct, with Abeta oligomers interacting with membrane lipids; or (iii) both mechanisms take place. Recent studies indicate that Abeta oligomers may act by either of the last two. Little is known about the oligomers' structures and how they spontaneously insert into the membrane. Using explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that fibril-like Abeta(17-42) (p3) oligomer is capable of penetrating the membrane. Insertion is similar to that observed for protegrin-1 (PG-1), a cytolytic beta-sheet-rich antimicrobial peptide (AMP). Both Abeta and PG-1 favor the amphipathic interface of the lipid bilayer in the early stage of interaction with the membrane. U-shaped Abeta oligomers are observed in solution and in the membrane, suggesting that the preformed seeds can be shared by amyloid fibrils in the growth phase and membrane toxicity. Here we provide sequential events in possible Abeta oligomer membrane-insertion pathways. We speculate that for the U-shaped motif, a trimer is the minimal oligomer size to insert effectively. We propose that monomers and dimers may insert in (apparently on-pathway) aggregation-intermediate beta-hairpin state, and may (or may not) convert to a U-shape in the bilayer. Together with earlier observations, our results point to a non-specific, broadly heterogeneous landscape of membrane-inserting oligomer conformations, pathways, and membrane-mediated toxicity of beta-rich oligomers.",

    "abstract": "Although the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not clearly understood, neuroinflammation has been known to play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. To investigate a functional link between the neuroinflammation and AD, the effect of leukotriene D4 (LTD4), an inflammatory lipid mediator, was studied on amyloid-beta generation in vitro. Application of LTD4 to cell monolayers at concentrations up to 40 nM LTD4 caused increases in the Abeta releases. Concentrations >= 40 nM LTD4 decreased neuronal viability. Application of 20 nM LTD4 caused a significant increase in Abeta generation, as assessed by ELISA or Western blotting, without significant cytotoxicity. At this concentration, exposure of neurons to LTD4 for 24h produced maximal effect in the Abeta generation, and significant increases in the expressions of cysteinyl leukotriene 1 receptor (CysLT(1)R) and activity of beta- or gamma-secretase with complete abrogation by the selective CysLT(1)R antagonist pranlukast. Exposure of neurons to LTD4 for 1h showed activation of NF-kappaB pathway, by assessing the levels of p65 or phospho-p65 in the nucleus, and either CysLT(1)R antagonist pranlukast or NF-kappaB inhibitor PDTC prevented the nuclear translocation of p65 and the consequent phosphorylation. PDTC also inhibited LTD4-induced elevations of beta- or gamma-secretase activity and Abeta generation in vitro. Overall, our data show for the first time that LTD4 causes Abeta production by enhancement of beta- or gamma-secretase resulting from activation of CysLT(1)R-mediated NF-kappaB signaling pathway. These findings provide a novel pathologic link between neuroinflammation and AD.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibrillary tangles are aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau that are one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau phosphorylation is regulated by a balance of kinase and phosphatase activities. Our previous study has demonstrated that ginsenoside Rd, one of the principal active ingredients of Pana notoginseng, inhibits okadaic acid-induced tau phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro, but the underlying mechanism(s) is unknown. In this study, we showed that ginsenoside Rd pretreatment inhibited tau phosphorylation at multiple sites in beta-amyloid (Abeta)-treated cultured cortical neurons, and in vivo in both a rat and transgenic mouse model. Ginsenoside Rd not only reduced Abeta-induced increased expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta), the most important kinase involved in tau phosphorylation, but also inhibited its activity by enhancing and attenuating its phosphorylation at Ser9 and Tyr216, respectively. Moreover, ginsenoside Rd enhanced the activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP-2A), a key phosphatase involved in tau dephosphorylation. Finally, an in vitro biochemical assay revealed that ginsenoside Rd directly affected GSK-3beta and PP-2A activities. Thus, our findings provide the first evidence that ginsenoside Rd attenuates Abeta-induced pathological tau phosphorylation by altering the functional balance of GSK-3beta and PP-2A.",

The pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disease, currently without curative treatment, is associated with the accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) in brain parenchyma and cerebral vasculature. AD patients are unable to clear this toxic peptide, leading to Abeta accumulation in their brains and, presumably, the pathology associated with this devastating disease. Compounds that stimulate the immune system to clear Abeta may therefore have great therapeutic potential in AD patients. Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) is an LPS-derived Toll-like receptor 4 agonist that exhibits unique immunomodulatory properties at doses that are nonpyrogenic. We show here that repeated systemic injections of MPL, but not LPS, significantly improved AD-related pathology in APP(swe)/PS1 mice. MPL treatment led to a significant reduction in Abeta load in the brain of these mice, as well as enhanced cognitive function. MPL induced a potent phagocytic response by microglia while triggering a moderate inflammatory reaction. Our data suggest that the Toll-like receptor 4 agonist MPL may be a treatment for AD.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: (18)F-florbetaben and positron emission tomography were used to examine the relationships between beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition, cognition, hippocampal volume, and white matter hyperintensities in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Forty-five MCI participants were evaluated. A neocortical standardized uptake value ratio threshold >= 1.45 was used to discriminate high from low Abeta burden. Correlations were adjusted for age, gender and years of education. RESULTS: High Abeta burden was found in 53% of MCI. Regression analyses showed standardized uptake value ratio (r = -0.51, P = 0.0015) and hippocampal volume (r = 0.60, P = 0.024) both contributing to episodic memory impairment in independent fashion. White matter hyperintensities correlated with nonmemory cognition, and this correlation was particularly associated with Abeta burden. CONCLUSION: Higher Abeta deposition in MCI is associated with more severe memory impairment and is contributing to early amnestic symptoms independent of hippocampal atrophy.",

    "abstract": "Tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau pathologies, are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) comprising filamentous tau protein. Although emerging evidence suggests that tau pathology may be transmitted, we demonstrate here that synthetic tau fibrils are sufficient to transmit tau inclusions in a mouse model. Specifically, intracerebral inoculation of young PS19 mice overexpressing mutant human tau (P301S) with synthetic preformed fibrils (pffs) assembled from recombinant full-length tau or truncated tau containing four microtubule binding repeats resulted in rapid induction of NFT-like inclusions that propagated from injected sites to connected brain regions in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, injection of tau pffs into either hippocampus or striatum together with overlaying cortex gave rise to distinct pattern of spreading. Moreover, unlike tau pathology that spontaneously develops in old PS19 mice, the pff-induced tau inclusions more closely resembled AD NFTs because they were Thioflavin S positive, acetylated, and more resistant to proteinase K digestion. Together, our study demonstrates that synthetic tau pffs alone are capable of inducing authentic NFT-like tau aggregates and initiating spreading of tau pathology in a tauopathy mouse model.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid fibrils can be generated from proteins with diverse sequences and folds. Although amyloid fibrils assembled in vitro commonly involve a single protein precursor, fibrils formed in vivo can contain more than one protein sequence. How fibril structure and stability differ in fibrils composed of single proteins (homopolymeric fibrils) from those generated by co-polymerization of more than one protein sequence (heteropolymeric fibrils) is poorly understood. Here we compare the structure and stability of homo and heteropolymeric fibrils formed from human beta2-microglobulin and its truncated variant DeltaN6. We use an array of approaches (limited proteolysis, magic angle spinning NMR, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and fluorescence) combined with measurements of thermodynamic stability to characterize the different fibril types. The results reveal fibrils with different structural properties, different side-chain packing, and strikingly different stabilities. These findings demonstrate how co-polymerization of related precursor sequences can expand the repertoire of structural and thermodynamic polymorphism in amyloid fibrils to an extent that is greater than that obtained by polymerization of a single precursor alone.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients show abnormally high concentrations of Cu(2+) in the amyloid beta plaques. This invokes that Cu(2+) might play a crucial role in the onset of AD. The last few decades of research have also shown that Cu(2+) plays a significant role in the aggregation of Abeta plaques in the brain and the generation of oxidative stress. Because the crystal structures of Cu-Abeta are yet to be obtained, there are various proposed models for the Cu(2+) coordination environment of Abeta peptides. In this study, we have used the truncated hydrophilic part of the native Abeta peptide to probe the Cu(2+) coordination site of the peptide, using a combination of spectroscopy and exogenous ligand-binding studies. It is evident from our study that Abeta(1-16) binds 1 equiv of Cu(2+) and yet shows an equilibrium between two species with a pK(a) of ~8.1. Ligand-field analysis of absorption and circular dichroism spectroscopy data indicates five-coordinate geometry for both components. We investigate the effect of azide and 8-hydroxyquinoline binding to Cu-Abeta and demonstrate the presence of a water-derived ligand and a second exchangeable ligand coordinated to copper at physiological pH, along the equatorial plane of a square-pyramidal active site.",

We recently reported an altered conformational state of p53 in tissues from patients with Alzheimer 's disease (AD), because of a deregulation of HIPK2 activity, leading to an impaired and dysfunctional response to stressors. Here, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the deregulation of HIPK2 activity in two cellular models, HEK-293 cells and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells differentiated with retinoic acid over-expressing the amyloid precursor protein, focusing on the evidence that zyxin expression is important to maintain HIPK2 protein stability. We demonstrated that both beta-amyloid (Abeta) 1-40 and 1-42 induce zyxin deregulation, thus affecting the transcriptional repressor activity of HIPK2 onto its target promoter, metallothionein 2A, which is in turn responsible for the induction of an altered conformational state of p53. We demonstrate for the first time that zyxin is a novel target of Abeta activities in AD. These results may help the studies on the pathogenesis of AD, through the fine dissection of events related to beta-amyloid activities.",

Previous studies identified EFhd2 associated with pathological forms of tau proteins in the tauopathy mouse model JNPL3, which expresses the human tau(P301L) mutant. This association was validated in human tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role that EFhd2 may play in tauopathies is still unknown. Here, we show that EFhd2 formed amyloid structures in vitro, a capability that is reduced by calcium ions. Electron microscopy (EM) analyses demonstrated that recombinant EFhd2 formed filamentous structures. EM analyses of sarkosyl-insoluble fractions derived from human AD brains also indicated that EFhd2 co-localizes with aggregated tau proteins and formed granular structures. Immunohistological analyses of brain slices demonstrated that EFhd2 co-localizes with pathological tau proteins in AD brains, confirming the co-aggregation of EFhd2 and pathological tau. Furthermore, EFhd2's coiled-coil domain mediated its self-oligomerization in vitro and its association with tau proteins in JNPL3 mouse brain extracts. The results demonstrate that EFhd2 is a novel amyloid protein associated with pathological tau proteins in AD brain and that calcium binding may regulate the formation of EFhd2's amyloid structures. Hence, EFhd2 may play an important role in the pathobiology of tau-mediated neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "A diverse number of diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and type 2 diabetes, are characterized by the formation of fibrillar protein aggregates termed amyloids. The precise mechanism by which aggregates are toxic remains unclear; however, these proteins have been shown to interact strongly with lipid membranes. We investigated morphological and mechanical changes in model lipid bilayers exposed to amyloid-forming proteins by reconstructing the tapping forces associated with atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging in solution. Tip/sample tapping forces contain information regarding mechanical properties of surfaces. Interpretation of the mechanical changes in the bilayers was aided by numerical simulations of the entire AFM experiment. Amyloid-forming proteins disrupted distinct regions of the bilayer morphology, and these regions were associated with decreased Young's modulus and adhesive properties. These changes in bilayer mechanical properties upon exposure to amyloid-forming proteins may represent a common mechanism leading to membrane dysfunction in amyloid diseases.",

Although accumulating evidence suggests that adverse environmental stressors such as unbalanced levels of metal ions may trigger amyloid-mediated membrane damage, many features of the molecular mechanisms underlying these events are unknown. Using human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP, aka amylin), an amyloidogenic peptide associated with beta-cell death in type 2 diabetes, we demonstrate that the presence of Ca(2+) ions inhibits membrane damage occurring immediately after the interaction of freshly dissolved hIAPP with the membrane, but significantly enhances fiber-dependent membrane disruption. In particular, dye leakage, quartz crystal microbalance, atomic force microscopy, and NMR experiments show that Ca(2+) ions promote a shallow membrane insertion of hIAPP, which leads to the removal of lipids from the bilayer through a detergent-like mechanism triggered by fiber growth. Because both types of membrane-damage mechanisms are common to amyloid toxicity by most amyloidogenic proteins, it is likely that unregulated ion homeostasis, amyloid aggregation, and membrane disruption are all parts of a self-perpetuating cycle that fuels amyloid cytotoxicity.",

The model was received with interest because we described the temporal evolution of AD biomarkers in relation to each other and to the onset and progression of clinical symptoms. Since then, evidence has accumulated that supports the major assumptions of this model. Evidence has also appeared that challenges some of our assumptions, which has allowed us to modify our original model. Refinements to our model include indexing of individuals by time rather than clinical symptom severity; incorporation of interindividual variability in cognitive impairment associated with progression of AD pathophysiology; modifications of the specific temporal ordering of some biomarkers; and recognition that the two major proteinopathies underlying AD biomarker changes, amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau, might be initiated independently in sporadic AD, in which we hypothesise that an incident Abeta pathophysiology can accelerate antecedent limbic and brainstem tauopathy.",

    "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The fruits of Schisandra chinensis (Trucz.) Baill. (Schisandraceae) which have been used as a tonic especially for kidney yin deficiency in Chinese traditional medicine are recently receiving attention for its preventive activity on age-related neurodegenerative diseases. A variety of studies demonstrated the cognitive-enhancing effects of Schisandra chinensis through animal tests and also in clinical trials. AIM OF STUDY: In this study, we attempted to investigate the effects of the lignan-riched extract of Schisandra chinensis fruits (ESP-806) on neurotoxicity and memory impairment induced by Abeta1-42 injection in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The fruits of Schisandra chinensis were extracted with the mixture of n-hexane:ethanol (9:1), which is riched with bioactive dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans, schizandrin, gomisin N, wuweigisu C. After oral treatment of ESP-806 (100 mg/kg body weight) followed by injection of Abeta1-42 (2 mug/mouse, i.c.v.), novel object recognition and passive avoidance tests were evaluated. To verify the cognition enhancing effects of ESP-806, we examined the effects of ESP-806 on the activities of beta-secretase and acetylcholinesterase, and the contents of Abeta and the reduced glutathione within the cortex and hippocampus of Abeta-injected mice. RESULTS: Oral treatment of ESP-806 (100 mg/kg body weight) significantly attenuated Abeta1-42-induced memory impairment evaluated by behavioral tests. Furthermore, the treatment of ESP-806 attenuated the elevation of beta-secretase activity accompanying the reduced level of Abeta1-42 in the cortex and hippocampus of the brain. ESP-806 also significantly inhibited the acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus and increased the content of the reduced glutathione in the cortex and hippocampus of mouse brain. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggested that the extract of Schisandra chinensis fruits riched with dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans may be useful in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "There is now strong evidence to show that the presence of the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) mediates amyloid-beta (Abeta) neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we probe the molecular details of the interaction between PrP(C) and Abeta and discover that substoichiometric amounts of PrP(C), as little as 1/20, relative to Abeta will strongly inhibit amyloid fibril formation. This effect is specific to the unstructured N-terminal domain of PrP(C). Electron microscopy indicates PrP(C) is able to trap Abeta in an oligomeric form. Unlike fibers, this oligomeric Abeta contains antiparallel beta sheet and binds to a oligomer specific conformational antibody. Our NMR studies show that a specific region of PrP(C), notably residues 95-113, binds to Abeta oligomers, but only once Abeta misfolds. The ability of PrP(C) to trap and concentrate Abeta in an oligomeric form and disassemble mature fibers suggests a mechanism by which PrP(C) might confer Abeta toxicity in AD, as oligomers are thought to be the toxic form of Abeta. Identification of a specific recognition site on PrP(C) that traps Abeta in an oligomeric form is potentially a therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Increased levels of nicotinamide/nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) act as a powerful suppressor of Wallerian degeneration and ataxin- and tau-induced neurodegeneration in flies and mice. However, the nature of the suppression mechanism/s remains controversial. Here, we show that in yeast models of proteinopathies, overexpression of the NMNAT yeast homologs, NMA1 and NMA2, suppresses polyglutamine (PolyQ) and alpha-synuclein-induced cytotoxicities. Unexpectedly, overexpression of other genes in the salvage pathway for NAD(+) biosynthesis, including QNS1, NPT1 and PNC1 also protected against proteotoxicity. Our data revealed that in all cases, this mechanism involves extensive clearance of the non-native protein. Importantly, we demonstrate that suppression by NMA1 does not require the presence of a functional salvage pathway for NAD(+) biosynthesis, SIR2 or an active mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. Our results imply the existence of histone deacetylase- and OXPHOS-independent crosstalk between the proteins in the salvage pathway for NAD(+) biosynthesis and the proteasome that can be manipulated to achieve cellular protection against proteotoxic stress.",

    "title": "Reduction and the intracellular translocation of EphB2 in Tg2576 mice and the effects of beta-amyloid.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: EphB2 is a member of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) family that is essential for the cell adhesion, neural crest migration, axon guidance and synaptogenesis in the nervous system. Recent studies show that preservation of EphB2 in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) rescues the cognitive deficit, suggesting a crucial role of EphB2 in AD. However, the expression and distribution profiles of EphB2 in the early stage of AD have not been reported. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, immunoblot and immunofluorescence were used to analyse the level of EphB2 in Tg2576 mice at different ages and in cultured neurones with Abeta treatment at different times. RESULTS: EphB2 was reduced in an age-dependent manner in the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice. The decrease of EphB2 appeared earlier in the olfactory bulb than the hippocampus, and reduction of EphB2 appeared earlier than that of MAP2, a dendritic cytoskeleton marker. In the cortex, EphB2 displayed a significant translocation from the neuronal processes to the cell bodies with ageing. In primary hippocampal neuronal cultures, Abeta42 treatment also induced the decrement of EphB2 that was prior to the decline of MAP2. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide the first evidence for an age- and region-dependent reduction and intracellular translocation of EphB2 in Tg2576 mice, and the foremost decrement of EphB2 in the olfactory bulb may represent an early sign of AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder of unknown etiology. Mechanistically, beta amyloid peptides (Abeta) and elevated Ca(2+) have been implicated as proximal and likely interactive features of the disease process. We tested the hypothesis that proximity to Abeta plaque might exacerbate activity-dependent neuronal Ca(2+) signaling in hippocampal pyramidal neurons from APPSWE/PS1M146V mice. Using combined approaches of whole cell patch clamp recording and 2-photon imaging of neuronal Ca(2+) signals with thioflavin-S plaque labeling in hippocampal slices, we found no correlation between thioflavin-S labeled Abeta plaque proximity and Ca(2+) responses triggered by ryanodine receptor (RyR) activation or action potentials in either dendrites or somata of AD mice, regardless of age. Baseline and RyR-stimulated spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials also showed little difference in relation to Abeta plaque proximity. Consistent with previous studies, RyR-evoked Ca(2+) release in APPSWE/PS1M146V mice was greater than in nontransgenic controls. Within the soma, RyR-evoked Ca(2+) release was elevated in older APPSWE/PS1M146V mice compared with younger APPSWE/PS1M146V mice, but was still independent of plaque proximity. The results indicate that early Ca(2+) signaling disruptions can become yet more severe with age through mechanisms independent of Abeta plaques, suggesting that alternative pathogenic mechanisms might contribute to AD-associated dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Oligomers of the 40 and 42 residue amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta40 and Abeta42) have been implicated in the neuronal damage and impaired cognitive function associated with Alzheimer's disease. However, little is known about the specific mechanisms by which these misfolded species induce such detrimental effects on cells. In this work, we use single-molecule imaging techniques to examine the initial interactions between Abeta monomers and oligomers and the membranes of live cells. This highly sensitive method enables the visualization of individual Abeta species on the cell surface and characterization of their oligomerization state, all at biologically relevant, nanomolar concentrations. The results indicate that oligomers preferentially interact with cell membranes, relative to monomers and that the oligomers become immobilized on the cell surface. Additionally, we observe that the interaction of Abeta species with the cell membrane is inhibited by the presence of ATP-independent molecular chaperones. This study demonstrates the power of this methodology for characterizing the interactions between protein aggregates and the membranes of live neuronal cells at physiologically relevant concentrations and opens the door to quantitative studies of the cellular responses to potentially pathogenic oligomers.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral deposits of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) form the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). In the brain, Abeta can aggregate as insoluble fibrils present in amyloid plaques and vascular amyloid, or as diffuse plaques consisting of mainly non-fibrillar Abeta. Previously, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be capable of detecting individual amyloid plaques, not only via the associated iron, but also Abeta itself has been suggested to be responsible for a decrease in the image intensity. In this current study we aim to investigate the MRI properties of the different cerebral Abeta deposits including diffuse plaques and vascular amyloid. Postmortem 60-mum-thick brain sections of AD, CAA, and Down's syndrome patients, known to contain Abeta, were studied. High resolution T2*- and T2-weighted MRI scans and quantitative relaxation maps were acquired using a microcoil on a Bruker 9.4T MRI system. Specific MRI characteristics of each type of Abeta deposit were examined by co-registration of the MRI with Congo Red and Abeta-immunostainings of the same sections. Our results show that only fibrillar Abeta, present in both vascular and parenchymal amyloid, induced a significant change in T2* and T2 values. However, signal changes were not as consistent for all of the vessels affected by CAA, irrespective of possible dyshoric changes. In contrast, the non-fibrillar diffuse plaques did not create any detectable MRI signal changes. These findings are relevant for the interpretation and further development of (quantitative) MRI methods for the detection and follow-up of AD and CAA.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of chronic hypoxia treatment on beta-amyloid, tau pathologies, and the behavioral consequences in the double transgenic (APP/PS1) mice. Double transgenic mice (APP/PS1 mice) were treated with hypoxia, and spatial learning and memory abilities of mice were assessed in the Morris water maze. beta-amyloid level and plaque level in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice were detected by immunohistochemistry. Protein tau, p35/p25, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), and calpain were detected by western blotting analysis. Chronic hypoxia treatment decreased memory and cognitive function in AD mice. In addition, chronic hypoxia treatment resulted in increased senile plaques, accompanying with increased tau phosphorylation. The hypoxia-induced increase in the tau phosphorylation was associated with a significant increase in the production of p35 and p25 and upregulation of calpain, suggesting that hypoxia induced aberrant CDK5/p25 activation via upregulation of calpain. Our results showed that chronic hypoxia exposure accelerates not only amyloid pathology but also tau pathology via calpain-mediated tau hyperphosphorylation in an AD mouse model. These pathological changes possibly contribute to the hypoxia-induced behavioral change in AD mice.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid disorders incorporate a wide range of human diseases arising from the failure of a specific peptide or protein to adopt, or remain in, its native functional conformational state. These pathological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease are highly debilitating, exact enormous costs on both individuals and society, and are predicted to increase in prevalence. Consequently, they form the focus of a topical and rich area of current scientific research. A major goal in attempts to understand and treat protein misfolding diseases is to define the structures and interactions of protein species intermediate between fully folded and aggregated, and extract a description of the aggregation process. This has proven a difficult task due to the inability of traditional structural biology approaches to analyze structurally heterogeneous systems. Continued developments in instrumentation and analytical approaches have seen ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) emerge as a complementary approach for protein structure determination, and in some cases, a structural biology tool in its own right. IM-MS is well suited to the study of protein misfolding, and has already yielded significant structural information for selected amyloidogenic systems during the aggregation process. This review describes IM-MS for protein structure investigation, and provides a summary of current research highlighting how this methodology has unequivocally and unprecedentedly provided structural and mechanistic detail pertaining to the oligomerization of a variety of disease related proteins.",

However, genetic knockout and shRNA studies have led to contradictory conclusions about their role during embryonic brain development. To address this issue, we analysed in depth the role of APLP2 during neurogenesis by silencing APLP2 in vivo in an APP/APLP1 double knockout mouse background. We find that under these conditions cortical progenitors remain in their undifferentiated state much longer, displaying a higher number of mitotic cells. In addition, we show that neuron-specific APLP2 downregulation does not impact the speed or position of migrating excitatory cortical neurons. In summary, our data reveal that APLP2 is specifically required for proper cell cycle exit of neuronal progenitors, and thus has a distinct role in priming cortical progenitors for neuronal differentiation.",

We now report that this ectopic cell cycle re-entry (CCR) requires soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau, the respective building blocks of the insoluble plaques and tangles that accumulate in AD brain. Exposure of cultured wild type (WT) neurons to Abeta oligomers caused CCR and activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, fyn, the cAMP-regulated protein kinase A and calcium-calmodulin kinase II, which respectively phosphorylated tau on Y18, S409 and S416. In tau knockout (KO) neurons, Abeta oligomers activated all three kinases, but failed to induce CCR. Expression of WT, but not Y18F, S409A or S416A tau restored CCR in tau KO neurons. Tau-dependent CCR was also observed in vivo in an AD mouse model. CCR, a seminal step in AD pathogenesis, therefore requires signaling from Abeta through tau independently of their incorporation into plaques and tangles.",

Several compounds based on the diaryl hydrazone scaffold were designed. Forty-four substituted derivatives of this core structure were synthesized using a variety of benzaldehydes and phenylhydrazines and characterized. The inhibitor candidates were evaluated in multiple assays, including the inhibition of amyloid beta (Abeta) fibrillogenesis and oligomer formation and the reverse processes, the disassembly of preformed fibrils and oligomers. Because the structure of the hydrazone-based inhibitors mimics the redox features of the antioxidant resveratrol, the radical scavenging effect of the compounds was evaluated by colorimetric assays against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and superoxide radicals. The hydrazone scaffold was active in all of the different assays. The structure-activity relationship revealed that the substituents on the aromatic rings had a considerable effect on the overall activity of the compounds. The inhibitors showed strong activity in fibrillogenesis inhibition and disassembly, and even greater potency in the inhibition of oligomer formation and oligomer disassembly. Supporting the quantitative fluorometric and colorimetric assays, size exclusion chromatographic studies indicated that the best compounds practically eliminated or substantially inhibited the formation of soluble, aggregated Abeta species, as well. Atomic force microscopy was also applied to monitor the morphology of Abeta deposits. The compounds also possessed the predicted antioxidant properties; approximately 30% of the synthesized compounds showed a radical scavenging effect equal to or better than that of resveratrol or ascorbic acid.",

Here, we propose a conceptual framework to guide this next generation of pharmacological and non-pharmacological clinical pursuit, and discuss some of the foreseeable ethical considerations that may accompany them.",

    "title": "Vulnerable neural systems and the borderland of brain aging and neurodegeneration.",
    "abstract": "Brain aging is characterized by considerable heterogeneity, including varying degrees of dysfunction in specific brain systems, notably a medial temporal lobe memory system and a frontostriatal executive system. These same systems are also affected by neurodegenerative diseases. Recent work using techniques for presymptomatic detection of disease in cognitively normal older people has shown that some of the late life alterations in cognition, neural structure, and function attributed to aging probably reflect early neurodegeneration. However, it has become clear that these same brain systems are also vulnerable to aging in the absence of even subtle disease. Thus, fundamental systemic limitations appear to confer vulnerability of these neural systems to a variety of insults, including those recognized as typical disease and those that are attributed to age. By focusing on the fundamental causes of neural system vulnerability, the prevention or treatment of a wide range of late-life neural dysfunction might be possible.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intracellular deposition of tau protein is a hallmark lesion of Alzheimer's disease. Although it is known this event is secondary to excessive tau phosphorylation, the mechanisms involved remain unknown. We previously reported that the enzyme 5-Lipoxygenase (5LO) acts as a modulator of Abeta peptides formation in vivo, and here we investigate its influence on tau protein. METHODS: Tg2576 mice overexpressing neuronal 5LO were generated and its contribution to endogenous tau levels and metabolism investigated. RESULTS: Although no differences were noted in the levels of total tau for both groups, compared with controls, Tg2576 mice overexpressing 5LO had a significant increase in the phosphorylation state of tau at S396 and S396/S404, as recognized by the antibodies PHF-13 and PHF-1, respectively. By contrast, no phosphorylation changes were observed in other tau epitopes. This increase was associated with a significant elevation in cyclin dependent kinase-5 but not other kinases that have been involved in tau phosphorylation. Additionally, mice overexpressing 5LO had biochemical evidence of altered synaptic integrity because they manifested a reduction in PSD-95, synaptophysin and MAP2. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a new role for 5LO in regulating endogenous tau metabolism in the central nervous system and supports the hypothesis that its pharmacologic inhibition could be beneficial for Alzheimer's disease-related tau neuropathology.",

    "abstract": "The formation of low-order oligomers of beta-amyloid (Abeta) within the brain is widely believed to be a central component of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, despite advances in high-throughput and high-resolution techniques such as xMAP and mass spectrometry (MS), investigations into these oligomeric species have remained reliant on low-resolution Western blots and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The current investigation compared Abeta profiles within human cortical tissue using sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), xMAP and surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS and found that whilst there was significant correlation across the techniques regarding levels of monomeric Abeta, only SDS-PAGE was capable of detecting dimeric isoforms of Abeta. The addition of synthetic di-tyrosine cross-linked Abeta(1-40)Met(35)(O) to the AD tissue demonstrated that the MS methodology was capable of observing dimeric Abeta at femto-molar concentrations, with no noticeable effect on monomeric Abeta levels. Focus turned to the association between SDS-PAGE and levels of observable dimeric Abeta within the AD brain tissue. These investigations revealed that increased levels of dimeric Abeta were observed with increasing concentrations of SDS in the sample buffer. This finding was subsequently confirmed using synthetic Abeta(1-42) and suggests that SDS was inducing the formation of dimeric Abeta. The findings that SDS promotes Abeta dimerization have significant implications for the putative role of low-order oligomers in AD pathogenesis and draw into question the utility of oligomeric Abeta as a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, produced through endo-proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein, are thought to be involved in the death of neural cells in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the mechanisms are not fully known, it has been suggested that disruption of cellular activity due to Abeta interactions with the cell membrane may be one of the underlying causes. Here in, we have investigated the interaction between Abeta-42 and biomimetic lipid membranes and the resulting perturbations in the lipid vesicles. We have shown that Abeta oligomeric species localized closer to the membrane surface. Localization of the fibrillar species of Abeta-42, although varied, was not as closely associated with the membrane surface. We have demonstrated that the presence of Abeta-42 leads to an increase in membrane surface area, inducing lipid temporal vesicular transformation. Furthermore, we have unequivocally shown that Abeta-peptides mediate membrane fusion. Although membrane fusion induced by Abeta has been hypothesized/proposed, this is the first time it has been visually captured. This fusion may be one of the mechanisms behind the membrane increase in surface area and the resulting vesicular transformation. We have shown that the longer 'amyloidogenic' isoform causes vesicular transformation more readily, and has a higher membrane fusogenic potential than Abeta-40. Although not core to this study, it is hugely interesting to observe the high agreement between membrane dynamics and the reported amyloidogenicity of the peptides and aggregation species opening up the potential role of vesicular dynamics for profiling and biosensing of Abeta-induced neuro-toxicity.",

Several pathogenic familial mutations of Abeta peptides have been identified that exhibit enhanced neurotoxicity and aggregative ability. However, knowledge of the structural characteristics of those Abeta mutants is still limited. Here, we report multiple all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the wild-type 42-residue Abeta peptide (Abeta42) and its Flemish (A21G), Arctic (E22G), Dutch (E22Q), Italian (E22K), and Iowa (D23N) familial mutants in explicit water. After validating our simulations by comparison with available experimental data, we examined common/different features in the secondary and tertiary structures of the wild-type and five familial mutants of Abeta42. We found that Abeta42 peptides display quite heterogeneous secondary and tertiary structure ensembles. Such structural heterogeneity in the monomeric state would facilitate interconversions between various secondary structures during the formation of a beta-sheet-rich amyloid fibril, and may also serve as a structural basis of the amyloid polymorphism.",

Our all-atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the strong electrostatic interaction induces the \"upright\" conformation on mica, whereas the hydrophobic interaction favors the \"flat\" conformation on HOPG. We also show that the epitaxial pattern on mica is ensured by the lattice matching between the anisotropic binding sites of the basal substrate and the molecular dimension of GAV-9, accompanied with a long-range order of well-defined beta-strands. Furthermore, the binding free energy surfaces indicate that the longitudinal assembly growth is predominantly driven by the hydrophobic interaction along the longer crystallographic unit cell direction of mica.

    "abstract": "A hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) is the accumulation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in the brain. Considerable evidence suggests that soluble Abeta oligomers are responsible for the synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficit observed in AD. However, the mechanism by which these oligomers exert their neurotoxic effect remains unknown. Recently, it was reported that Abeta oligomers bind to the cellular prion protein with high affinity. Here, we show that N1, the main physiological cleavage fragment of the cellular prion protein, is necessary and sufficient for binding early oligomeric intermediates during Abeta polymerization into amyloid fibrils. The ability of N1 to bind Abeta oligomers is influenced by positively charged residues in two sites (positions 23-31 and 95-105) and is dependent on the length of the sequence between them. Importantly, we also show that N1 strongly suppresses Abeta oligomer toxicity in cultured murine hippocampal neurons, in a Caenorhabditis elegans-based assay, and in vivo in a mouse model of Abeta-induced memory dysfunction. These data suggest that N1, or small peptides derived from it, could be potent inhibitors of Abeta oligomer toxicity and represent an entirely new class of therapeutic agents for AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease in which aging is not only a major risk factor but a major determinant of onset, course, and pathogenesis. The synthesis of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides by neurons and their excretion into the extracellular space (ECS) is a core feature of AD that begins more than two decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. The ECS resembles a syncytium with the appearance in electron micrographs of continuous channels and lakes separating the outer membranes of the neurons, neuroglia, and vascular elements embedded in it. It consists primarily of a proteoglycan matrix through which circulates an interstitial fluid, derived in part from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The process by which Abeta accumulates in the ECS includes decreased production of CSF, matrix proteoglycans, and ECS volume, all of which become more severe with advancing age and lead to an age-related increase in the Abeta pool. Although the relationship between Abeta and the appearance of cognitive symptoms is uncertain, available data support a strong relationship between the toxicity of Abeta for neurons and the total Abeta burden, including the soluble and fibrillar Abeta, the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio, and Abeta-proteoglycan reactivity. Proteoglycans have been shown to foster the formation of neurotoxic fibrillar Abeta42 and neuritic plaques that enhance neuronal and synaptic damage and eventual loss culminating in the onset and progression of dementia. As this process depends upon age-related events, it suggests that the successful control of AD lies in finding effective means of prevention.",

Biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), such as amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42), total tau (T-tau), and hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau181P), are linked to the different pathological hallmarks of AD. We set up a study to investigate the influence of AD co-pathology on CSF biomarker concentrations and profiles in autopsy-confirmed DLB. DLB patients with senile plaques showed significantly lower CSF Abeta1-42 concentrations than DLB patients without senile plaques, but not compared to the AD patients. There were no significant differences in CSF T-tau or P-tau181P concentrations between DLB patients with and without neurofibrillary tangles. A correlation was found between the number of APOE epsilon4 alleles and Abeta1-42 CSF levels in DLB patients with senile plaques. Although the CSF biomarkers Abeta1-42, T-tau, and P-tau181P have an added diagnostic value for the differential dementia diagnosis, concomitant amyloid pathology in DLB limits the use of CSF Abeta1-42 for the differential diagnosis of AD versus DLB.",

    "title": "Aftins increase amyloid-beta42, lower amyloid-beta38, and do not alter amyloid-beta40 extracellular production in vitro: toward a chemical model of Alzheimer's disease?",
    "abstract": "Increased production of amyloid-beta (Abeta)42 peptide, derived from the amyloid-beta protein precursor, and its subsequent aggregation into oligomers and plaques constitutes a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We here report on a family of low molecular weight molecules, the Aftins (Amyloid-beta Forty-Two Inducers), which, in cultured cells, dramatically affect the production of extracellular/secreted amyloid peptides. Aftins trigger beta-secretase inhibitor and gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) sensitive, robust upregulation of Abeta42, and parallel down-regulation of Abeta38, while Abeta40 levels remain stable. In contrast, intracellular levels of these amyloids appear to remain stable. In terms of their effects on Abeta38/Abeta40/Abeta42 relative abundance, Aftins act opposite to gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs). Abeta42 upregulation induced by Aftin-5 is unlikely to originate from reduced proteolytic degradation or diminished autophagy. Aftin-5 has little effects on mitochondrial functional parameters (swelling, transmembrane potential loss, cytochrome c release, oxygen consumption) but reversibly alters the ultrastructure of mitochondria. Aftins thus alter the Abeta levels in a fashion similar to that described in the brain of AD patients. Aftins therefore constitute new pharmacological tools to investigate this essential aspect of AD, in cell cultures, allowing (1) the detection of inhibitors of Aftin induced action (potential 'anti-AD compounds', including GSIs and GSMs) but also (2) the identification, in the human chemical exposome, of compounds that, like Aftins, might trigger sustained Abeta42 production and Abeta38 down-regulation (potential 'pro-AD compounds').",

For this purpose, a double-transgenic mouse (PS2Tg2576 mice) was produced by cross-breeding transgenic mice carrying human mutant PS2 (N141I) with Tg2576 mice. Long-trace interval (trace interval=500ms) eyeblink conditioning was tested in the PS2Tg2576 mice at ages 3, 4, 6, and 12 months. At 3 months, PS2Tg2576 mice exhibited normal acquisition of conditioned responses (CRs) during trace eyeblink conditioning, whereas trace conditioning was significantly impaired in PS2Tg2576 mice at ages 4, 6, and 12 months. In contrast, Tg2576 mice showed intact memory performance during trace conditioning at 4 months. This cross-sectional study clearly indicates that PS2 mutation significantly accelerates the onset of cognitive impairment in associative trace eyeblink memory.",

Twelve brain regions including neocortical, limbic, and subcortical areas were dissected from brains of non-demented individuals and extracted according to increasing insolubility by a sequential three-step method. The levels of Abeta40, Abeta42, apoE, APP, APP-CTFbeta, BACE1, presenilin-1, neprilysin, insulysin, LRP1, LDLR, synaptophysin, PSD95, GFAP, and lactate were determined by ELISAs or enzymatic assays. The regional distribution of apoE showed moderate-to-strong inverse correlation with levels of Abeta, especially insoluble Abeta40. On the other hand, the regional distributions of synaptic markers, particularly PSD95, showed moderate-to-strong positive correlation with levels of Abeta, especially soluble Abeta40. The regional correlations between Abeta and LRP1, GFAP, or lactate were mild-to-moderate. Moderate-to-strong positive regional correlations were observed between apoE and GFAP or lactate and between PSD95 and LRP1. No significant regional correlations were detected between Abeta and APP, APP-CTFbeta, BACE1, or presenilin-1, those involved in Abeta production. There were no significant negative regional correlations between Abeta and two major Abeta degrading enzymes, neprilysin and insulysin. These regional correlations remained consistent regardless of the degree of Abeta accumulation. The regional vulnerability to Abeta accumulation may be due to a net balance between two competing processes: (1) synapses involved in promoting the initial Abeta accumulation and (2) astrocyte-derived apoE involved in preventing Abeta accumulation.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) is closely related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although much effort has been devoted to the construction of molecules that inhibit the aggregation of Abeta1-42, high doses are needed for the inhibition of Abeta aggregation in many cases. Previously, we reported that designed green fluorescent protein (GFP) analogues that gives pseudo-Abeta beta-sheet structures can work as an aggregation inhibitor against Abeta. To further test this design strategy, we constructed protein analogues that mimic Abeta beta-sheet structures of amyloids by using insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor domain 11 (IGF2R-d11) as a scaffold. A designed protein, named IG11KK, which has a parallel configuration of Abeta-like beta sheets, can bind more preferentially to oligomeric Abeta1-42 than the monomer. Moreover, IG11KK suppressed the aggregation of Abeta1-42 efficiently, even though lower concentrations of IG11KK than Abeta were used. The aggregation kinetics of Abeta in the presence of the designed proteins revealed that IG11KK can work as an inhibitor not only for the early to middle stages, but also in the latter stage of Abeta aggregation owing to its favorable binding to oligomeric structures of Abeta. The design strategy using beta-barrel proteins such as IGF2R-d11 and GFP is useful in generating excellent inhibitors of protein misfolding and amyloid formation.",

In this study, we report the application of the de novo fragment-based molecular design program SPROUT to the discovery of a series of nonpeptide BACE1 inhibitors based upon a biphenylacetamide scaffold. The binding affinity of molecules based upon this designed molecular scaffold was increased from an initial BACE1 IC50 of 323 muM to 27 muM following the synthesis of a library of optimized ligands whose structures were refined using the recently developed SPROUT-HitOpt software. Although a number of inhibitors were found to exhibit cellular toxicity, one compound in the series was found to have useful BACE1 inhibitory activity in a cellular assay with minimal cellular toxicity. This work demonstrates the power of an in silico fragment-based molecular design approach in the discovery of novel BACE1 inhibitors.",

    "title": "Globular and protofibrillar abeta aggregates impair neurotransmission by different mechanisms.",
    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease, substantial evidence indicates the causative role of soluble amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregates. Although a variety of Abeta assemblies have been described, the debate about their individual relevance is still ongoing. One critical issue hampering this debate is the use of different methods for the characterization of endogenous and synthetic peptide and their intrinsic limitations for distinguishing Abeta aggregates. Here, we used different protocols for the establishment of prefibrillar Abeta assemblies with varying morphologies and sizes and compared them in a head-to-head fashion. Aggregation was characterized via the monomeric peptide over time until spheroidal, protofibrillar, or fibrillar Abeta aggregates were predominant. It could be shown that a change in the ionic environment induced a structural rearrangement, which consequently confounds the delineation of a measured neurotoxicity toward a distinct Abeta assembly. Here, neuronal binding and hippocampal neurotransmission were found to be suitable to account for the synaptotoxicity to different Abeta assemblies, based on the stability of the applied Abeta aggregates in these settings. In contrast to monomeric or fibrillar Abeta, different prefibrillar Abeta aggregates targeted neurons and impaired hippocampal neurotransmission with nanomolar potency, albeit by different modalities. Spheroidal Abeta aggregates inhibited NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation, as opposed to protofibrillar Abeta aggregates, which inhibited AMPAR-dominated basal neurotransmission. In addition, a provoked structural conversion of spheroidal to protofibrillar Abeta assemblies resulted in a time-dependent suppression of basal neurotransmission, indicative of a mechanistic switch in synaptic impairment. Thus, we emphasize the importance of addressing the metastability of prefacto characterized Abeta aggregates in assigning a biological effect.",

    "title": "Interaction of glycine zipper fragments of Abeta-peptides with neuronal nitric oxide synthase: kinetic, thermodynamic and spectrofluorimetric analysis.",
    "abstract": "Five peptide fragments [Abeta(17-21); Abeta(25-29); Abeta(29-33); Abeta(33-37); Abeta(25-37)] of the toxic Abeta(1-40(42)) amyloid peptide were shown to bind with neuronal nitric oxide synthase by means of hydrophobic-hydrophobic forces. The enzyme has a single site for the amyloid peptide binding, which resulted in a quenching of the intrinsic fluorescence of the enzyme. Binding constants determined from Stern-Volmer analysis were between 9x10(-3) and 1.8x10(-2) muM(-1). As temperature increased these binding constants increased reflecting that the interaction of the amyloid peptides with nNOS was endothermic and the quenching was dynamic. Kinetic analysis revealed a non-competitive interaction of the amyloid peptides to the enzyme with inhibitor constants of 5.1 muM for Abeta(17-21) to about 8-12 muM for the other peptides. According to the van't Hoff relationship the thermodynamic parameters, DeltaH, DeltaS and DeltaG for the interaction of the amyloid peptides were all positive and between 41.28 and 77.86 kJ mol(-1)K(-1), 104.92 and 220.82 J mol(-1)K(-1) and 9.92 and 13.13 kJ mol(-1)K(-1), respectively. This suggested that the transition state, created by the amyloid peptide-nNOS complex and generated during the initial stages of Abeta aggregation had to, initially, overcome an activation barrier. Since the DeltaG values decreased as temperature increased it not only implied a non-spontaneous interaction but that hydrophobic forces were operative during the binding. By FRET analysis the distance between the donor enzyme and the acceptor amyloid peptide was between 2.7 and 2.8 nm. As the temperature increased from 298 K through 313 K (and higher) the fraction of these tryptophan residues that became exposed increased, to approach a value of 1. There was strong support for the initial interaction being through the glycine zipper regions of Abeta(25-37).",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Soluble oligomers of amyloid ss-protein (Ass) have been increasingly linked to synaptic dysfunction, tau alteration, and neuritic dystrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mouse models. There is a great need for assays that quantify Ass oligomers with high specificity and sensitivity. METHODS: We designed and validated two oligomer-specific (o-) enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs) using either an Ass aggregate-selective monoclonal for capture and a monoclonal to the free N-terminus for detection, or the latter antibody for both capture and detection. RESULTS: The o-ELISAs specifically quantified pure oligomers of synthetic Ass with sizes from dimers up to much larger assemblies and over a wide dynamic range of concentrations, whereas Ass monomers were undetectable. Natural Ass oligomers of similarly wide size and concentration ranges were measured in extracts of AD and control brains, revealing >1000-fold higher concentrations of Ass oligomers than monomers in the soluble fraction of AD cortex. The assays quantified the age-related rise in oligomers in hAPP transgenic mice. Unexpectedly, none of 90 human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples gave a specific signal in either o-ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: These new o-ELISAs with rigorously confirmed specificity can quantify oligomer burden in human and mouse brains for diagnostic and mechanistic studies and for AD biomarker development. However, our data raise the likelihood that the hydrophobicity of Ass oligomers makes them very low in number or absent in aqueous CSF.",

Here we show that RARalpha signalling is down-regulated by amyloid beta (Abeta), which inhibits the synthesis of the endogenous ligand, retinoic acid (RA). This results in the counteraction of a variety of RARalpha-activated pathways that are key in the aetiopathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but which can be reversed by an RARalpha agonist. RARalpha signalling improves cognition in the Tg2576 mice, it has an anti-inflammatory effect and promotes Abeta clearance by increasing insulin degrading enzyme and neprilysin activity in both microglia and neurons. In addition, RARalpha signalling prevents tau phosphorylation. Therefore, stimulation of the RARalpha signalling pathway using a synthetic agonist, by both clearing Abeta and counteracting some of its toxic effects, offers therapeutic potential for the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Growing evidence of cell-to-cell transmission of neurodegenerative disease (ND)-associated proteins (NDAPs) (ie, tau, Abeta, and alpha-synuclein) suggests possible similarities to the infectious prion protein (PrPsc) in spongiform encephalopathies. There are limited data on the potential human-to-human transmission of NDAPs associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) and other non-PrPsc ND. OBJECTIVE: To examine evidence for human-to-human transmission of AD, Parkinson disease (PD), and related NDAPs in cadaveric human growth hormone (c-hGH) recipients. DESIGN: We conducted a detailed immunohistochemical analysis of pathological NDAPs other than PrPsc in human pituitary glands. We also searched for ND in recipients of pituitary-derived c-hGH by reviewing the National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NHPP) cohort database and medical literature. SETTING: University-based academic center and agencies of the US Department of Health and Human Services. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four routine autopsy subjects (10 non-ND controls and 24 patients with ND) and a US cohort of c-hGH recipients in the NHPP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detectable NDAPs in human pituitary sections and death certificate reports of non-PrPsc ND in the NHPP database. RESULTS: We found mild amounts of pathological tau, Abeta, and alpha-synuclein deposits in the adeno/neurohypophysis of patients with ND and control patients. No cases of AD or PD were identified, and 3 deaths attributed to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were found among US NHPP c-hGH recipients, including 2 of the 796 decedents in the originally confirmed NHPP c-hGH cohort database. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite the likely frequent exposure of c-hGH recipients to NDAPs, and their markedly elevated risk of PrPsc-related disease, this population of NHPP c-hGH recipients does not appear to be at increased risk of AD or PD. We discovered 3 ALS cases of unclear significance among US c-hGH recipients despite the absence of pathological deposits of ALS-associated proteins (TDP-43, FUS, and ubiquilin) in human pituitary glands. In this unique in vivo model of human-to-human transmission, we found no evidence to support concerns that NDAPs underlying AD and PD transmit disease in humans despite evidence of their cell-to-cell transmission in model systems of these disorders. Further monitoring is required to confirm these conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the presenilin1 (PSEN1) and amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) genes account for the majority of cases of autosomal dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease (AD). We wished to assess and compare the patterns of cerebral loss produced by these two groups of mutations. Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological assessments were performed in individuals with clinical AD carrying mutations in the APP (n = 10) and PSEN1 (n = 18) genes and in healthy controls (n = 18). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM), cortical thickness, and region of interest analyses were performed. Mini-Mental State Examination scores were similar in the two disease groups suggesting similar levels of disease severity. There was evidence that APP subjects have smaller hippocampal volume compared with PSEN1 subjects (p = 0.007), and weak evidence that they have larger whole-brain and grey matter volumes (both p = 0.07). Although there was no evidence of statistically significant differences between APP and PSEN1 in VBM or cortical thickness analyses, effect-maps were suggestive of APP subjects having more medial temporal lobe atrophy and conversely PSEN1 subjects showing more neocortical loss. Neuropsychological data were consistent with these regional differences and suggested greater memory deficits in the APP patients and greater impairment in non-memory domains in the PSEN1 group, although these differences were not statistically significant. We conclude that the mechanisms by which APP and PSEN1 mutations cause neuronal loss may differ which furthers our understanding of the neuropathology underlying AD and may inform future therapeutic strategies and trial designs.",

    "abstract": "Deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in cerebral arteries, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), occurs both in the setting of Alzheimer's disease and independent of it, and can cause cerebrovascular insufficiency and cognitive deficits. The mechanisms leading to CAA have not been established, and no therapeutic targets have been identified. We investigated the role of CD36, an innate immunity receptor involved in Abeta trafficking, in the neurovascular dysfunction, cognitive deficits, and amyloid accumulation that occurs in mice expressing the Swedish mutation of the amyloid precursor protein (Tg2576). We found that Tg2576 mice lacking CD36 have a selective reduction in Abeta1-40 and CAA. This reduced vascular amyloid deposition was associated with preservation of the Abeta vascular clearance receptor LRP-1, and protection from the deleterious effects of Abeta on cerebral arterioles. These beneficial vascular effects were reflected by marked improvements in neurovascular regulation and cognitive performance. Our data suggest that CD36 promotes vascular amyloid deposition and the resulting cerebrovascular damage, leading to neurovascular dysfunction and cognitive deficits. These findings identify a previously unrecognized role of CD36 in the mechanisms of vascular amyloid deposition, and suggest that this scavenger receptor is a putative therapeutic target for CAA and related conditions.",

In an attempt to explore the diagnostic potential of platelet AbetaPP metabolism, we have generated monoclonal antibodies directed to the N-terminal part of AbetaPP. We have observed two different antibody recognition patterns of AbetaPP: one resembling previously described 130 kDa and 105 kDa species and a novel AbetaPP 115 kDa form. This form was significantly increased in platelets of the mild cognitive impairment and AD group as compared to control subjects. The abundance of AbetaPP 115 kDa species correlated with the previously described AbetaPP 130/105 kDa ratio as well as with Mini-Mental State Examination score. Despite the inability of these particular monoclonal antibodies to recognize native forms of AbetaPP, identification of a new AbetaPP isoform in platelets as a potential AD biomarker can provide an additional tool for the development of a reliable diagnostic test to detect preclinical stages of AD.",

    "title": "Effect of alpha-synuclein on amyloid beta-induced toxicity: relevance to Lewy body variant of Alzheimer disease.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease, the most prevalent age-related neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by the presence of extracellular senile plaques composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. More than 50 % of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients also exhibit abundant accumulation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn)-positive Lewy bodies. This Lewy body variant of AD (LBV-AD) is associated with accelerated cognitive dysfunction and progresses more rapidly than pure AD. In addition, it has been suggested that Abeta and alpha-Syn can directly interact. In this study we investigated the effect of alpha-Syn on Abeta-induced toxicity in cortical neurons. In order to mimic the intracellular accumulation of alpha-Syn observed in the brain of LBV-AD patients, we used valproic acid (VPA) to increase its endogenous expression levels. The release of alpha-Syn from damaged presynaptic terminals that occurs during the course of the disease was simulated by challenging cells with recombinant alpha-Syn. Our results showed that either VPA-induced alpha-Syn upregulation or addition of recombinant alpha-Syn protect primary cortical neurons from soluble Abeta1-42 decreasing the caspase-3-mediated cell death. It was also found that neuroprotection against Abeta-induced toxicity mediated by alpha-Syn overexpression involves the PI3K/Akt cell survival pathway. Furthermore, recombinant alpha-Syn was shown to directly interact with Abeta1-42 and to decrease the levels of Abeta1-42 oligomers, which might explain its neuroprotective effect. In conclusion, we demonstrate that either endogenous or exogenous alpha-Syn can be neuroprotective against Abeta-induced cell death, suggesting a cell defence mechanism during the initial stages of the mixed pathology.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To provide updated estimates of Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia prevalence in the United States from 2010 through 2050. METHODS: Probabilities of AD dementia incidence were calculated from a longitudinal, population-based study including substantial numbers of both black and white participants. Incidence probabilities for single year of age, race, and level of education were calculated using weighted logistic regression and AD dementia diagnosis from 2,577 detailed clinical evaluations of 1,913 people obtained from stratified random samples of previously disease-free individuals in a population of 10,800. These were combined with US mortality, education, and new US Census Bureau estimates of current and future population to estimate current and future numbers of people with AD dementia in the United States. RESULTS: We estimated that in 2010, there were 4.7 million individuals aged 65 years or older with AD dementia (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.0-5.5). Of these, 0.7 million (95% CI = 0.4-0.9) were between 65 and 74 years, 2.3 million were between 75 and 84 years (95% CI = 1.7-2.9), and 1.8 million were 85 years or older (95% CI = 1.4-2.2). The total number of people with AD dementia in 2050 is projected to be 13.8 million, with 7.0 million aged 85 years or older. CONCLUSION: The number of people in the United States with AD dementia will increase dramatically in the next 40 years unless preventive measures are developed.",

    "abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that leads to peripheral cytopenias. We observed that SMAD7, a negative regulator of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptor-I kinase, is markedly reduced in MDS and leads to ineffective hematopoiesis by overactivation of TGF-beta signaling. To determine the cause of SMAD7 reduction in MDS, we analyzed the 3'UTR of the gene and determined that it contains a highly conserved putative binding site for microRNA-21. We observed significantly elevated levels of miR-21 in MDS marrow samples when compared with age-matched controls. miR-21 was shown to directly bind to the 3'UTR of SMAD7 and reduce its expression in hematopoietic cells. Next, we tested the role of miR-21 in regulating TGF-beta signaling in a TGF-beta-overexpressing transgenic mouse model that develops progressive anemia and dysplasia and thus serves as a model of human bone marrow failure. Treatment with a chemically modified miR-21 inhibitor led to significant increases in hematocrit and led to an increase in SMAD7 expression in vivo. Inhibition of miR-21 also led to an increase in erythroid colony formation from primary MDS bone marrow progenitors, demonstrating its ability in stimulating hematopoiesis in vitro. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the role of miR-21 in regulating overactivated TGF-beta signaling in MDS.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brain is believed to contribute to the pathology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Abeta levels are controlled by the production of Abeta from amyloid precursor protein, degradation by proteases, and peripheral clearance. In this study we sought to determine whether enhancing clearance of plasma Abeta with a peripherally administered Abeta-degrading protease would reduce brain Abeta levels through a peripheral sink. Neprilysin (NEP) is a zinc-dependent metalloprotease that is one of the key Abeta-degrading enzymes in the brain. We developed a NEP fusion protein with in vitro degradation of Abeta and a 10 day plasma half-life in mouse. Intravenous administration of NEP to wild-type and APP23 transgenic mice resulted in dose-dependent clearance of plasma Abeta. However, this did not correspond to reduced levels of soluble brain Abeta with treatment up to 5 weeks in WT mice or formic acid-extractable brain Abeta with 3 month treatment in aged APP23. In contrast, intracranial injection of NEP resulted in an acute decrease in soluble brain Abeta. We found no change in amyloid precursor protein gene expression in mice treated with intravenous NEP, suggesting that the lack of effects in the brain following this route of administration was not caused by compensatory upregulation of Abeta production. Taken together, these results suggest a lack of a robust peripheral Abeta efflux sink through which brain amyloid burdens can be therapeutically reduced.",

After treatment, the following assessments were performed: cell viability and aggregation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial peroxidation, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and apoptosis. Aggregation, lactate dehydrogenase activity, malondialdehyde concentrations, mitochondrial peroxidation, ROS levels, and apoptosis were significantly increased in Abeta25-35-treated cells but decreased in the treatment with edaravone 40 and 80 muM. In contrast, intracellular glutathione and superoxide dismutase concentrations were significantly decreased in Abeta25-35-treated cells but increased in the treatment with edaravone 40 and 80 muM.

    "abstract": "Patients with the early-onset Alzheimer's disease P117L mutation in the presenilin-1 gene (PS-1) present pathological hallmarks in the hippocampus, the frontal cortex and the basal ganglia. In the present work we determined by immunohistochemistry which brain regions were injured in the transgenic PS-1 P117L mice, in comparison to their littermates, the B6D2 mice. Furthermore, as these regions are involved in novelty detection, we investigated the behavior of these mice in tests for object and place novelty recognition. Limited numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles were detected in aged PS-1 P117L mice in the CA1 only, indicating that the disease is restrained to an initial neuropathological stage. Western blots showed a change in PSD-95 expression (p=0.03), not in NR2A subunit, NR2B subunit and synaptophysin expressions in the frontal cortex, suggesting specific synaptic alterations. The behavioral tests repeatedly revealed, despite a non-significant preference for object or place novelty, maladaptive exploratory behavior of the PS-1 P117L mice in novel environmental conditions, not due to locomotor problems. These mice, unlike the B6D2 mice, were less inhibited to visit the center of the cages (p=0.01) and they continued to move excessively in the presence of a displaced object (p=0.021). Overall, the PS-1 P117L mice appear to be in an initial Alzheimer's disease-like neuropathological stage, and they showed a lack of reaction toward novel environmental conditions.",

Salidroside, the major active ingredient of Rhodiola crenulata, has been previously shown to have antioxidant and neuroprotective properties in vitro. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of salidroside on Abeta-induced cognitive impairment in vivo. Rats received intrahippocampal Abeta1-40 injection were treated with salidroside (25, 50 and 75 mg/kg p.o.) once daily for 21 days. Learning and memory performance were assessed in the Morris water maze (days 17-21). After behavioral testing, the rats were sacrificed and hippocampi were removed for biochemical assays (reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malondialdehyde (MDA), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), acetylcholine (ACh)) and molecular biological analysis (Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, GPx, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), inhibitor of kappaB-alpha (IkappaBalpha), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)). Our results confirmed that Abeta1-40 peptide caused learning and memory deficits in rats. Further analysis demonstrated that the NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative stress was increased in Abeta1-40-injected rats. Furthermore, NF-kappaB was demonstrated to be activated in Abeta1-40-injected rats, and the COX-2, iNOS and RAGE expression were also induced by Abeta1-40. However, salidroside (50 and 75 mg/kg p.o.) reversed all the former alterations. Thus, the study indicates that salidroside may have a protective effect against AD via modulating oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators.",

    "abstract": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36-amino acid peptide widely distributed in the central nervous system (CNS) that has been associated with the modulation of several functions including food intake, learning and memory, mood and neuroprotection. There is great interest in understanding the role of NPY in the deleterious effects induced by the central accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we evaluated the effects of a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of NPY (0.0234 mumol/muL) 15 min prior to the i.c.v. injection of aggregated Abeta1-40 peptide (400 pmol/mouse) in behavioral and neurochemical parameters related to oxidative stress in mice. Pretreatment with NPY prevented Abeta1-40-induced depressive-like responses and spatial memory impairments evaluated in the tail suspension and object location tasks, respectively. The protective effects of NPY on spatial memory of Abeta1-40-treated mice were abolished by the pretreatment with the selective Y2 receptor antagonist BIIE0246. On the other hand, the administration of NPY and Abeta1-40 did not alter the performance of the animals in the elevated plus-maze and open field arena, indicating lack of effects on anxiety state and locomotor function. Although Abeta1-40 infusion did not change hippocampal and cortical glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and glutathione (GSH) levels, Abeta1-40-infused animals showed an increased lipid peroxidation in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex that were blunted by NPY administration. These findings indicate that central administration of NPY prevents Abeta1-40-induced depressive-like behavior and spatial memory deficits in mice and that this response is mediated, at least in part, by the activation of Y2 receptors and prevention of oxidative stress.",

    "title": "gamma-Secretase modulator (GSM) photoaffinity probes reveal distinct allosteric binding sites on presenilin.",
    "abstract": "gamma-Secretase is an intramembrane aspartyl protease that cleaves the amyloid precursor protein to produce neurotoxic beta-amyloid peptides (i.e. Abeta42) that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Small molecule gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs) have emerged as potential disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer disease because they reduce the formation of Abeta42 while not blocking the processing of gamma-secretase substrates. We developed clickable GSM photoaffinity probes with the goal of identifying the target of various classes of GSMs and to better understand their mechanism of action. Here, we demonstrate that the photoaffinity probe E2012-BPyne specifically labels the N-terminal fragment of presenilin-1 (PS1-NTF) in cell membranes as well as in live cells and primary neuronal cultures. The labeling is competed in the presence of the parent imidazole GSM E2012, but not with acid GSM-1, allosteric GSI BMS-708163, or substrate docking site peptide inhibitor pep11, providing evidence that these compounds have distinct binding sites. Surprisingly, we found that the cross-linking of E2012-BPyne to PS1-NTF is significantly enhanced in the presence of the active site-directed GSI L-685,458 (L458). In contrast, L458 does not affect the labeling of the acid GSM photoprobe GSM-5. We also observed that E2012-BPyne specifically labels PS1-NTF (active gamma-secretase) but not full-length PS1 (inactive gamma-secretase) in ANP.24 cells. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that multiple binding sites within the gamma-secretase complex exist, each of which may contribute to different modes of modulatory action. Furthermore, the enhancement of PS1-NTF labeling by E2012-BPyne in the presence of L458 suggests a degree of cooperativity between the active site of gamma-secretase and the modulatory binding site of certain GSMs.",

Olfactory deficits are also commonly observed in AD, and prior work has indicated a link between increased apathy and olfactory dysfunction in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Here, we examined odor identification performance in patients with probable AD (n = 172), individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 112), and neurologically and psychiatrically healthy older adults (n = 132) and its relation to apathy, depression, and overall psychopathology. METHOD: Participants were administered the Sniffin' Sticks odor identification test and measures assessing severity of apathy, depression, and overall neuropsychiatric symptomatology. RESULTS: Consistent with previous research, AD and MCI patients were significantly worse at identifying odors than healthy older adults. Additionally, a sex by diagnosis interaction was observed. AD patients had significantly higher levels of apathy relative to MCI and control participants. Of note, across the entire sample odor identification deficits were correlated with level of apathy at the level of p < 0.01, but not with depression or neuropsychiatric symptom severity, when controlling for Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data suggest that olfactory disturbance and apathy in AD may result from the progression of disease pathology in shared neural substrates.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The M/V polymorphism in the PRNP gene has been extensively examined for the association to the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD); however, results from different studies have been inconsistent. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between the M/V polymorphism in the PRNP gene and the risk of AD. METHODS: A meta-analysis was carried out to analyze the association between the M/V polymorphism in the PRNP gene and the risk of AD. RESULTS: A total of 4228 cases and 4324 controls in 16 case-control studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results indicated that the variant V allele carriers (VV+MV) had a 13% decreased risk of AD, when compared with the homozygote MM (VV+MV vs. MM: OR=0.87, 95% CI=0.79-0.96, P=0.004). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant decreased risks of AD were found in the Caucasian V allele carriers (OR=0.85, 95% CI=0.77-0.94, P=0.002), but not in Asian V allele carriers (OR=1.11, 95% CI=0.78-1.57, P=0.57). In the subgroup analysis by age of onset, significant decreased risks of AD were associated with V allele carriers in late-onset Alzheimer disease (OR=0.76, 95% CI=0.62-0.93, P=0.007) but not in early-onset Alzheimer disease (OR=0.86, 95% CI=0.70-1.06, P=0.17).

We report that BIN1 transcript levels were increased in AD brains and identified a novel 3 bp insertion allele ~28 kb upstream of BIN1, which increased (i) transcriptional activity in vitro, (ii) BIN1 expression levels in human brain and (iii) AD risk in three independent case-control cohorts (Meta-analysed Odds ratio of 1.20 (1.14-1.26) (P=3.8 x 10(-11))). Interestingly, decreased expression of the Drosophila BIN1 ortholog Amph suppressed Tau-mediated neurotoxicity in three different assays. Accordingly, Tau and BIN1 colocalized and interacted in human neuroblastoma cells and in mouse brain. Finally, the 3 bp insertion was associated with Tau but not Amyloid loads in AD brains.

    "title": "The aging brain and cognition: contribution of vascular injury and abeta to mild cognitive dysfunction.",
    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: beta-Amyloid (Abeta) deposition and vascular brain injury (VBI) frequently co-occur and are both associated with cognitive decline in aging. Determining whether a direct relationship exists between them has been challenging. We sought to understand VBI's influence on cognition and clinical impairment, separate from and in conjunction with pathologic changes associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between neuroimaging measures of VBI and brain Abeta deposition and their associations with cognition. DESIGN AND SETTING: A cross-sectional study in a community- and clinic-based sample recruited for elevated vascular disease risk factors. PARTICIPANTS: Clinically normal (mean age, 77.1 years [N = 30]), cognitively impaired (mean age, 78.0 years [N = 24]), and mildly demented (mean age, 79.8 years [N = 7]) participants. INTERVENTIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging, Abeta (Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomographic [PiB-PET]) imaging, and cognitive testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Magnetic resonance images were rated for the presence and location of infarct (34 infarct-positive participants, 27 infarct-negative participants) and were used to quantify white matter lesion volume. The PiB-PET uptake ratios were used to create a PiB index by averaging uptake across regions vulnerable to early Abeta deposition; PiB positivity (29 PiB-positive participants, 32 PiB-negative participants) was determined from a data-derived threshold. Standardized composite cognitive measures included executive function and verbal and nonverbal memory. RESULTS: Vascular brain injury and Abeta were independent in both cognitively normal and impaired participants. Infarction, particularly in cortical and subcortical gray matter, was associated with lower cognitive performance in all domains (P < .05 for all comparisons). Pittsburgh Compound B positivity was neither a significant predictor of cognition nor interacted with VBI. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this elderly sample with normal cognition to mild dementia, enriched for vascular disease, VBI was more influential than Abeta in contemporaneous cognitive function and remained predictive after including the possible influence of Abeta. There was no evidence that VBI increases the likelihood of Abeta deposition. This finding highlights the importance of VBI in mild cognitive impairment and suggests that the impact of cerebrovascular disease should be considered with respect to defining the etiology of mild cognitive impairment.",

    "title": "Alternations of central insulin-like growth factor-1 sensitivity in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and neuronal models.",
    "abstract": "Although many post-mortem studies have found evidence of central insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, results on changes of central insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling in the pathological process of AD remain controversial. In the present study, we observed the activation states of IGF-1 downstream signaling in brain slices of transgenic mice carrying APPswe/PS1dE9 mutations (APP/PS1 mice) at both early and late stages (ex vivo) and further investigated the involvement of oligomeric beta-amyloid (Abeta) and Abeta-enriched culture medium (CM) on IGF-1 sensitivity employing neuronal models (in vitro). In 6- and 18-month-old APP/PS1 mice, the phosphorylations of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and Akt in response to IGF-1 stimulation were significantly reduced in the hippocampal and cortical slices, whereas IGF-1R protein expression and mRNA levels of IGF-1 and IGF-1R in the hippocampal slices were significantly higher than that in wild-type mice. In agreement with these results, reduced IGF-1 sensitivity was verified in APP and PS1 double stably transfected CHO cells; moreover, IGF-1 stimulated phosphorylations of IGF-1R and Akt were also markedly weakened by oligomeric Abeta or Abeta-enriched CM posttreatment in CHO cells without APP/PS1-transfected (K1 cells) and primary hippocampal neurons. These observations indicate that the impaired central IGF-1 sensitivity at early and late stages of APP/PS1 transgenic mice might be attributable, at least partially, to the overproduced Abeta, especially the oligomeric Abeta. These findings may shed new light on the mechanisms underlying the defective IGF-1 signaling in AD pathogenesis and provide important clues for AD drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Although amyloid beta (Abeta) is a critical player in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, there is currently little Information on the rate and extent of formation of oligomers that lead to the presence of Abeta fibrils observed in amyloid plaques. Here we describe a unique method to monitor the full time course of Abeta aggregation. In this method, Abeta is labeled with tetramethylrhodamine at a lysine residue on the N-terminal end. During aggregation, the fluorescence is quenched in a time-dependent manner in three distinct phases: an early oligomerization phase, an intermediate phase, and a growth phase. The oligomerization phase can be characterized as a monomer-dimer-trimer process for which we have determined the rate and equilibrium constants. The rate constants differ markedly between Abeta(1-42) and Abeta(1-40), with Abeta(1-42) showing a greater oligomerization propensity. The intermediate phase reflects slow clustering and reorganization of the oligomers, whereas the growth phase ultimately results in the formation of fibrillar material. The data are consistent with a conformational change being an important rate-limiting step in the overall aggregation process. The rates of all phases are highly sensitive to temperature and pH, with the pH-dependent data indicating important roles for lysine and histidine residues. From the temperature-dependent data, activation energies of oligomerization and fibrillization are estimated to be 5.5 and 12.1 kCal/mol, respectively. The methodologies presented here are simple and can be applied to other amyloidogenic peptides or proteins.",

    "abstract": "It is known that oxidative stress leads to amyloid precursor protein (APP) dysregulation in platelets. Ethanol (EtOH) is a vascular risk factor and induces oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was thus to investigate whether EtOH affects APP processing in rat and human platelets. Platelets were exposed to 50 mM EtOH with and without 2 mM calcium-chloride (CaCl2) for 20 or 180 minutes at 37 C. Platelet aggregation, serotonin release and APP isoforms 130 and 106/110 kDa were analyzed. As a control, 100 mM H2O2 was tested in rat platelets. Our data show that EtOH alone did not affect any of the analyzed parameters, whereas CaCl2 significantly increased aggregation of rat and human platelets. In addition, CaCl2 alone enhanced serotonin release in rat platelets. EtOH counteracted CaCl2-induced aggregation and serotonin release. In the presence of CaCl2, EtOH reduced the 130 kDa APP isoform in rat and human platelets. In conclusion, this study shows that in the presence of CaCl2, EtOH affects the platelet function and APP processing in rat and human platelets.",

    "abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET) has been used extensively to evaluate the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in vivo. Radiotracers directed toward the amyloid deposition such as [(18)F]-FDDNP (2-(1-{6-[(2-[F]Fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile) and [(11)C]-PIB (Pittsburg compound B) have shown exceptional value in animal models and AD patients. Previously, the glucose analogue [(18)F]-FDG (2-[(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose) allowed researchers and clinicians to evaluate the brain glucose consumption and proved its utility for the early diagnosis and the monitoring of the progression of AD. Animal models of AD are based on the transgenic expression of different human mutant genes linked to familial AD. The novel transgenic 5XFAD mouse containing 5 mutated genes in its genome has been proposed as an AD model with rapid and massive cerebral amyloid deposition. PET studies performed with animal-dedicated scanners indicate that PET with amyloid-targeted radiotracers can detect the pathological amyloid deposition in transgenic mice and rats. However, in other studies no differences were found between transgenic mice and their wild type littermates. We sought to investigate in 5XFAD mice if the radiotracers [(11)C]-PIB, and [(18)F]-Florbetapir could quantify the amyloid deposition in vivo and if [(18)F]-FDG could do so with regard to glucose consumption. We found that 5XFAD animals presented higher cerebral binding of [(18)F]-Florbetapir, [(11)C]-PIB, and [(18)F]-FDG. These results support the use of amyloid PET radiotracers for the evaluation of AD animal models. Probably, the increased uptake observed with [(18)F]-FDG is a consequence of glial activation that occurs in 5XFAD mice.",

Results from Congo red spectral-shift assays reveal that all four compounds successfully inhibit association of Abeta monomers.

    "title": "Rapid, reversible impairment of synaptic signaling in cultured cortical neurons by exogenously-applied amyloid-beta.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is accompanied by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and the microtubule-associated protein tau. Abeta toxicity is dependent upon its form as well as concentration. Soluble Abeta oligomers, rather than the fibrillar forms that comprise senile plaques, represent the toxic form and are correlated with the extent of dementia. Since soluble Abeta perturbs synaptic function, we examined the impact of exogenously applied Abeta on signaling in neurons cultured on multi-electrode arrays. We observed that subcytotoxic levels (10 nm-5 muM) of human Abeta1-42 perturbed synaptic transmission within hours. This perturbation suggests that mild cognitive problems, perhaps undetected by traditional clinical approaches, can accompany critical accumulation of Abeta. This effect was prevented by the calcium chelator BAPTA, indicating a requirement for calcium for inhibition of signaling by Abeta. Abeta-induced inhibition of signaling was not prevented by application of MK-801 or nimodipine (antagonists of the NMDA receptor and L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channel, respectively) suggesting that Abeta may induce influx by either channel, or additional channels, or that neurons contained sufficient calcium to mediate the impact of Abeta. Signaling returned to original levels within 120 h after administration of a single dosage of Abeta, or within 24 h after replacement of medium with fresh medium lacking Abeta, suggesting that intervention to reduce Abeta levels at their first appearance may prevent permanent neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) affects mainly people over the age of 65 years, suffering from different clinical symptoms such as progressive decline in memory, thinking, language, and learning capacity. The toxic role of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) has now shifted from insoluble Abeta fibrils to smaller, soluble oligomeric Abeta aggregates. The urgent need for efficient new therapies is high; robust models dissecting the physiopathological aspects of the disease are needed. We present here a model allowing study of four cytopathic effects of Abeta oligomers (AbetaO): oxidative stress, loss of synapses, disorganization of the neurite network, and cellular death. By generating a solution of AbetaO and playing on the concentration of and time of exposure to AbetaO, we have shown that it was possible to reproduce early effects (oxidative stress) and the long-term development of structural alterations (death of neurons). We have shown that 1) all toxic events were linked to AbetaO according to a specific timing and pathway and 2) AbetaO were probably the key intermediates in AD pathogenesis. The present model, using Abeta peptide solution containing AbetaO, reproduced essential neuropathological features of AD; the effects involved were similar whatever the kind of neurons tested (cortical vs. hippocampal). By using a single system, it was possible to embrace all toxic mechanisms at defined times and concentrations, to study each involved pathway, and to study the effects of new molecules on the different neurotoxic pathways responsible for development of AD.",

    "abstract": "The default-mode network (DMN) is a distributed functional-anatomic network implicated in supporting memory. Current resting-state functional connectivity studies in humans remain divided on the exact involvement of medial temporal lobe (MTL) in this network at rest. Notably, it is unclear to what extent the MTL regions involved in successful memory encoding are connected to the cortical nodes of the DMN during resting state. Our findings using functional connectivity MRI analyses of resting-state data indicate that the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) is the primary hub of the DMN in the MTL during resting state. Also, connectivity of the PHG is distinct from connectivity of hippocampal regions identified by an associative memory-encoding task. We confirmed that several hippocampal encoding regions lack significant functional connectivity with cortical DMN nodes during resting state. Additionally, a mediation analysis showed that resting-state connectivity between the hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex--a major hub of the DMN--is indirect and mediated by the PHG. Our findings support the hypothesis that the MTL memory system represents a functional subnetwork that relates to the cortical nodes of the DMN through parahippocampal functional connections.",

There are two major isoforms of Abeta: the 42-residue Abeta42 and the 40-residue Abeta40. The only difference between Abeta42 and Abeta40 is that Abeta42 has two extra residues at the C-terminus. The amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's brains consist of mostly Abeta42 and some plaques contain only Abeta42, even though Abeta40 concentration is several-fold more than Abeta42. Using electron paramagnetic resonance, we studied the formation of amyloid fibrils using a mixture of Abeta42 and Abeta40 in vitro. We show that Abeta42 and Abeta40 form mixed fibrils in an interlaced manner, although Abeta40 is not as efficient as Abeta42 in terms of being incorporated into Abeta42 fibrils. Our results suggest that both Abeta42 and Abeta40 would be present in amyloid plaques if in vivo aggregation of Abeta were similar to the in vitro process. Therefore, there must be some mechanisms that lead to the preferential deposition of Abeta42 at the extracellular space. Identifying such mechanisms may open new avenues for therapeutic interventions to treat Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Several genetically engineered models exist that mimic aspects of the pathological and cognitive hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we report on a novel mouse model generated by targeted knock-in of transgenes containing mutated human amyloid precursor protein (APP) and microtubule-associated protein tau genes, inserted into the HPRT locus and controlled by the CaMKIIalpha regulatory element. These mice were crossed with an asymptomatic presenilin1A246E overexpressing line to generate PLB1Triple mice. Gene expression analysis and in situ hybridization confirmed stable, forebrain-specific, and gene-dose-dependent transgene expression. Brain tissue harvested from homozygous, heterozygous, and wild-type cohorts aged between 3 and 24 months was analyzed immunohistochemically and electrophysiologically. Homozygous PLB1Triple offspring presented with mostly intracellular cortical and hippocampal human APP/amyloid, first detected reliably at 6 months. Human tau was already uncovered at 3 months (phospho-tau at 6 months) and labeling intensifying progressively with age. Gene-dose dependence was confirmed in age-matched heterozygous females that accumulated less tau and amyloid protein. General excitability of hippocampal neurones was not altered in slices from PLB1Triple mice up to 12 months, but 2-year-old homozygous PLB1Triple mice had smaller synaptically evoked postsynaptic potentials compared with wild types. Synaptic plasticity (paired-pulse depression/facilitation and long-term potentiation) of synaptic CA1 pyramidal cell responses was deficient from 6 months of age. Long-term depression was not affected at any age or in any genotype. Therefore, despite comparatively subtle gene expression and protein build-up, PLB1Triple mice develop age-dependent progressive phenotypes, suggesting that aggressive protein accumulation is not necessary to reconstruct endophenotypes of AD.",

These Re complexes were designed and synthesized via the integrated approach, so their (99m)Tc analogs would have a greater chance of crossing the blood-brain barrier. While the lipophilicities (logPC18=1.59-3.53) of these Re 2-arylbenzothiazoles were all within suitable range, their binding affinities (Ki=30-617nM) to Abeta1-40 fibrils varied widely depending on the selection and integration of the tetradentate chelator into the 2-phenylbenzothiazole pharmacophore. For potential clinical applications, further refinement to obtain Re 2-arylbenzothiazoles with better binding affinities (<10nM) will likely be needed. The integrated approach reported here to generate compact, neutral and lipophilic Re 2-arylbenzothiazoles could be applied to other potent pharmacophores as well to convert other current Abeta PET tracers to their (99m)Tc analogs for more widespread application via the use of SPECT scanners.",

    "abstract": "Development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with failure of elimination of amyloid-beta (Abeta) from the brain along perivascular basement membranes that form the pathways for drainage of interstitial fluid and solutes from the brain. In transgenic APP mouse models of AD, the severity of cerebral amyloid angiopathy is greater in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, intermediate in the thalamus, and least in the striatum. In this study we test the hypothesis that age-related regional variation in (1) vascular basement membranes and (2) perivascular drainage of Abeta contribute to the different regional patterns of CAA in the mouse brain. Quantitative electron microscopy of the brains of 2-, 7-, and 23-month-old mice revealed significant age-related thickening of capillary basement membranes in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus, but not in the striatum. Results from Western blotting and immunocytochemistry experiments showed a significant reduction in collagen IV in the cortex and hippocampus with age and a reduction in laminin and nidogen 2 in the cortex and striatum. Injection of soluble Abeta into the hippocampus or thalamus showed an age-related reduction in perivascular drainage from the hippocampus but not from the thalamus. The results of the study suggest that changes in vascular basement membranes and perivascular drainage with age differ between brain regions, in the mouse, in a manner that may help to explain the differential deposition of Abeta in the brain in AD and may facilitate development of improved therapeutic strategies to remove Abeta from the brain in AD.",

    "abstract": "Oleocanthal, a phenolic component of extra-virgin olive oil, has been recently linked to reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau proteins in the brain. However, the mechanism by which oleocanthal exerts its neuroprotective effect is still incompletely understood. Here, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence for the potential of oleocanthal to enhance Abeta clearance from the brain via up-regulation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and LDL lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP1), major Abeta transport proteins, at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Results from in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated similar and consistent pattern of oleocanthal in controlling Abeta levels. In cultured mice brain endothelial cells, oleocanthal treatment increased P-gp and LRP1 expression and activity. Brain efflux index (BEI%) studies of (125)I-Abeta40 showed that administration of oleocanthal extracted from extra-virgin olive oil to C57BL/6 wild-type mice enhanced (125)I-Abeta40 clearance from the brain and increased the BEI% from 62.0 +- 3.0% for control mice to 79.9 +- 1.6% for oleocanthal treated mice. Increased P-gp and LRP1 expression in the brain microvessels and inhibition studies confirmed the role of up-regulation of these proteins in enhancing (125)I-Abeta40 clearance after oleocanthal treatment. Furthermore, our results demonstrated significant increase in (125)I-Abeta40 degradation as a result of the up-regulation of Abeta degrading enzymes following oleocanthal treatment. In conclusion, these findings provide experimental support that potential reduced risk of AD associated with extra-virgin olive oil could be mediated by enhancement of Abeta clearance from the brain.",

We then tested the reproducibility in C57BL/6 mice neurone cultures. RESULTS: In normal, aged mice and humans, we found an increase in clustered dystrophic neurites of cholinergic neurones in CA1 regions of the hippocampus and layer II and III regions of the entorhinal cortex, which are the major and earliest affected areas in AD. These dystrophic neurites showed accumulation of sAPPalpha peptides cleaved from the amyloid precursor protein by alpha-secretase rather than Abeta or C-terminal fragments. In contrast, Abeta and APP-CTFs accumulated in the dystrophic neurites in and around Abeta plaques of AD patients. Several experiments suggested that the accumulation of sAPPalpha resulted from ageing-related proteasomal dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Ageing-associated impairment of the proteasomal system and accumulation of sAPPalpha at cholinergic neurites in specific areas of brain regions associated with memory could be associated with the normal decline of memory in aged individuals. In addition, these age-related changes might be the most vulnerable targets of pathological insults that result in pathological accumulation of Abeta and/or APP-CTFs and lead to neurodegenerative conditions such as AD.",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) affect the quality of life of patients with dementia and increase the burden on caregivers. We aimed to evaluate how small vessel disease (SVD) such as lacunae or white matter hyperintensities (WMH), and amyloid burden affect NPS. We recruited 127 patients with subcortical vascular cognitive impairment who were assessed with brain magnetic resonance imaging, Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) positron emission tomography and the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI). To explore the association between lacunae, WMH, or PiB retention ratio and NPS, we performed multivariate regression analysis after controlling for possible confounders. Each additional lacuna, especially in the frontal region, was associated with higher odds of depression, apathy, aberrant motor behavior, nighttime behavior, appetite changes, and higher score of total NPI; larger WMH volume, especially in the frontal region, was associated with higher odds of apathy and higher score of total NPI. Furthermore, for the effects of lacunae or WMH on total NPI score we set Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes as the mediator. Greater PiB retention ratio was associated with higher odds of delusions and irritability. The SVD and amyloid pathologies did not show interactive effects on NPS. Our findings suggested that SVD and amyloid burden independently affected specific NPS.",

We report a multigenerational family with autosomal dominant presenile dementia harboring a cerebellar phenotype. Longitudinal clinical work-up in affected family members revealed ataxia accompanied by progressive cognitive decline, rapid loss of global cognition, memory, visuospatial and frontal-executive functions accompanied by progressive motor deterioration and early death. Linkage analysis and exome sequencing identified the p.S170F mutation of Presenilin 1 in all affected individuals, which is known to be associated with very early onset Alzheimer's disease. Additional search for potentially modifying variants revealed in all affected individuals of the third generation a paternally inherited variant p.A58V (rs17571) of Cathepsin D which is considered an independent risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Involvement of cerebellar and brainstem structures leading to functional decortication in addition to rapid progressive presenile dementia in this PSEN1 family may therefore indicate an epistatic effect of the p.A58V Cathepsin D variant on the deleterious course of this disease.",

In this study, we investigated the mechanism of Abeta fibril formation from hydrodynamically well defined species under controlled aggregation conditions. We present a detailed mechanistic model that furnishes a novel insight into the process of Abeta42 fibril formation and the molecular basis for the different structural transitions in the amyloid pathway. Our data reveal the structure and polymorphism of Abeta fibrils to be critically influenced by the oligomeric state of the starting materials, the ratio of monomeric-to-aggregated forms of Abeta42 (oligomers and protofibrils), and the occurrence of secondary nucleation. We demonstrate that monomeric Abeta42 plays an important role in mediating structural transitions in the amyloid pathway, and for the first time, we provide evidences that Abeta42 fibrillization occurs via a combined mechanism of nucleated polymerization and secondary nucleation. These findings will have significant implications to our understanding of the molecular basis of amyloid formation in vivo, of the heterogeneity of Abeta pathology (e.g., diffuse versus amyloid plaques), and of the structural basis of Abeta toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that elevated hippocampal activation may be important for disrupting cognitive functions in aged subjects as well as patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, reducing deleterious overactivity of the hippocampus may have therapeutic benefits. This study was designed to compare the effects of levetiracetam, an antiepileptic drug, on memory deficits associated with normal aging and AD in mouse models. Pretraining administration of levetiracetam ameliorated memory impairments of aged C57BL/6 mice (17-20months of age) in the contextual fear conditioning paradigm. Acute levetiracetam immediately after training was also efficacious in rescuing contextual memory decline in aged mice, whereas administration at a later posttraining interval (3h) had no effect. These results suggest that suppressing overexcitation with acute levetiracetam around the time of acquisition or early consolidation may be sufficient to reverse memory decline associated with aging. In contrast, pretraining administration of levetiracetam was not able to rescue memory deficits in 5XFAD transgenic mice harboring amyloid plaque pathologies at moderate (6-8months old) or massive (12-15months old) levels, differentiating between normal aging- and AD-related memory impairments in the responsiveness to acute levetiracetam treatment.",

    "abstract": "Several lines of evidence have supported the potential involvement of metal ions in the etiology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this interaction are still partially unknown. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) aggregation was strongly influenced by the conjugation of the peptide with few metal ions (aluminum, copper, zinc, and iron) that are found in high concentrations in the senile plaque core. The binding of aluminum (Al) to Abeta specifically stabilized the peptide in an oligomeric conformation. Here, we show that the aggregation of Abeta-Al was boosted by sodium dodecyl sulfate, a detergent that mimics some characteristics of biological membrane, suggesting a potential role for membrane components in the Abeta aggregation process. Notably, we also found that Abeta-Al caused mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species production in primary cortical neurons. Abeta-Al strongly promoted also alterations in cytoskeleton network as shown by the increased F-actin expression and the occurrence of neuritic beading. Interestingly, the neurotoxic effect of this metal complex was associated with a decreased mRNA expression of ubiquitin thiolesterase, an ubiquitin-dependent protein involved in catabolic process, and by the increased expression of glutaminyl cyclase, responsible for pathological post-translational modification of Abeta. These results suggest that, in neuronal cells, Abeta-Al can induce relevant detrimental changes that resemble pathological hallmarks of AD.",

In line with this, the current study characterised male APPxPS1 transgenic mice on mixed C57BL/6JxC3H/HeJ background for the first time for social recognition memory, sensorimotor gating, and spatial memory using the cheeseboard test as an alternative to the Morris water maze. Furthermore, locomotion, anxiety, and fear conditioning were evaluated in transgenic and wild type-like animals. APPxPS1 males displayed task-dependent hyperlocomotion and anxiety behaviours and exhibited social recognition memory impairments compared to wild type-like littermates. Spatial learning and memory, fear conditioning, and sensorimotor gating were unaffected in APPxPS1 transgenic mice. In conclusion, this study describes for the first time social recognition memory deficits in male APPxPS1 mice and suggests that spatial learning and memory deficits reported in earlier studies are dependent on the sex and genetic background of the APPxPS1 mouse line used. Furthermore, particular test conditions of anxiety and spatial memory paradigms appear to impact on the behavioural response of this transgenic mouse model for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the cerebral cortex is thought to be a pivotal event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis with a significant genetic contribution. Molecular imaging can provide an early noninvasive phenotype, but small samples have prohibited genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cortical Abeta load until now. We employed florbetapir ((18)F) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to assess brain Abeta levels in vivo for 555 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). More than six million common genetic variants were tested for association to quantitative global cortical Abeta load controlling for age, gender and diagnosis. Independent genome-wide significant associations were identified on chromosome 19 within APOE (apolipoprotein E) (rs429358, P=5.5 x 10(-14)) and on chromosome 3 upstream of BCHE (butyrylcholinesterase) (rs509208, P=2.7 x 10(-8)) in a region previously associated with serum BCHE activity. Together, these loci explained 15% of the variance in cortical Abeta levels in this sample (APOE 10.7%, BCHE 4.3%). Suggestive associations were identified within ITGA6, near EFNA5, EDIL3, ITGA1, PIK3R1, NFIB and ARID1B, and between NUAK1 and C12orf75. These results confirm the association of APOE with Abeta deposition and represent the largest known effect of BCHE on an AD-related phenotype. BCHE has been found in senile plaques and this new association of genetic variation at the BCHE locus with Abeta burden in humans may have implications for potential disease-modifying effects of BCHE-modulating agents in the AD spectrum.",

    "title": "White matter hyperintensities and cerebral amyloidosis: necessary and sufficient for clinical expression of Alzheimer disease?",
    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Current hypothetical models emphasize the importance of beta-amyloid in Alzheimer disease (AD) pathogenesis, although amyloid alone is not sufficient to account for the dementia syndrome. The impact of small-vessel cerebrovascular disease, visualized as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on magnetic resonance imaging scans, may be a key factor that contributes independently to AD presentation. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of WMHs and Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) positron-emission tomography-derived amyloid positivity on the clinical expression of AD. DESIGN: Baseline PIB-positron-emission tomography values were downloaded from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Total WMH volume was derived on accompanying structural magnetic resonance imaging data. We examined whether PIB positivity and total WMHs predicted diagnostic classification of patients with AD (n = 20) and control subjects (n = 21). A second analysis determined whether WMHs discriminated between those with and without the clinical diagnosis of AD among those who were classified as PIB positive (n = 28). A third analysis examined whether WMHs, in addition to PIB status, could be used to predict future risk for AD among subjects with mild cognitive impairment (n = 59). SETTING: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative public database. PARTICIPANTS: The study involved data from 21 normal control subjects, 59 subjects with mild cognitive impairment, and 20 participants with clinically defined AD from the Alzheimer Disease's Neuroimaging Initiative database. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical AD diagnosis and WMH volume. RESULTS: Pittsburgh Compound B positivity and increased total WMH volume independently predicted AD diagnosis. Among PIB-positive subjects, those diagnosed as having AD had greater WMH volume than normal control subjects. Among subjects with mild cognitive impairment, both WMH and PIB status at baseline conferred risk for future diagnosis of AD. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: White matter hyperintensities contribute to the presentation of AD and, in the context of significant amyloid deposition, may provide a second hit necessary for the clinical manifestation of the disease. As risk factors for the development of WMHs are modifiable, these findings suggest intervention and prevention strategies for the clinical syndrome of AD.",

    "title": "Increased expression of Beclin-1-dependent autophagy protects against beta-amyloid-induced cell injury in PC12 cells [corrected].",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related and progressive neurodegenerative disease. Beta-amyloid (Abeta) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Autophagy is a self-degradative process and its related protein Beclin-1 is involved in the initiation of autophagy. However, the role of Beclin-1 in the pathogenesis of AD is rarely reported. In this study, we examined cell viability and medium levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in PC12 cells incubated with gradient concentrations of Abeta(1-42) (0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10 muM) for 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, drew the index changes curves, and investigated the correlation between them. The result showed that cell viability was negatively correlated with NSE levels. Based on this study, Beclin-1 expression was quantitatively detected in Abeta1-42-treated PC12 cells and the dynamic changes curve of Beclin-1 was drawn from 3 to 72 h. Beclin-1 expression was positively correlated with cell viability. Furthermore, both autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and autophagy activator rapamycin were used to investigate the effect of autophagy on Abeta(1-42)-induced cell injury. Abeta(1-42)-induced Beclin-1 expression was further upregulated by rapamycin but was downregulated by 3-MA. Moreover, cell viability was increased by rapamycin but was decreased by 3-MA, and NSE was decreased by rapamycin but was increased by 3-MA, suggesting that activation of Beclin-1-dependent autophagy before the damage occurred can prevent neuronal cell death, while inhibition of Beclin-1-dependent autophagy can hastened cell death. These findings indicate that increasing Beclin-1-dependent autophagy may have a preventive effect before the AD occurred.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of extracellular amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has been considered as one of the important causes of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia. Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA), a major active chemical component isolated from Carthamus tinctorius L., has been shown to possess neuroprotective actions in various ischemic models in vivo. The present study aimed to investigate the potential protective effect of HSYA against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in cultured rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The PC12 cells were pretreated with different concentrations (20, 40 and 80 muM) of HSYA for 2 h and then further treated with Abeta (20 muM) for 24 h. The results showed that Abeta could significantly decrease cell viability, glutathione level, mitochondrial membrane potential and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax protein expression, while elevate the release of lactate dehydrogenase, the formation of DNA fragmentation, the levels of malondialdehyde and intracellular reactive oxygen species in PC12 cells. However, pretreatment with HSYA could effectively reverse these changes induced by Abeta in PC12 cells. Our experimental results demonstrate that HSYA may be a potential neuroprotective agent warranting further development for treatment of AD.",

However, inconsistent results have been reported regarding the risk of Alzheimer's disease among smokers. Previous studies in experimental animal models have reported that administration of some cigarette components (for example, nicotine) alters amyloid-beta aggregation, providing a possible link. However, extrapolation of these findings towards the in vivo scenario is not straightforward as smoke inhalation involves a number of other components. Here, we analysed the effect of smoking under more relevant conditions. We exposed transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease to cigarette smoke and analysed the neuropathological alterations in comparison with animals not subjected to smoke inhalation. Our results showed that smoking increases the severity of some abnormalities typical of Alzheimer's disease, including amyloidogenesis, neuroinflammation and tau phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that cigarette smoking may increase Alzheimer's disease onset and exacerbate its features and thus, may constitute an important environmental risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The incidence of Alzheimer disease may increase after surgical interventions. Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) fibrillogenesis, which is closely related to Alzheimer disease, is reportedly accelerated by exposure to anesthetics. However, the effects of GM1 ganglioside (GM1) on Alphabeta fibrillogenesis have not yet been reported. The current study was designed to examine whether the anesthetics propofol and thiopental are associated with Alphabeta assembly and GM1 expression on the neuronal cell surface. METHODS: PC12N cells and cultured neuronal cells were treated with propofol or thiopental, and GM1 expression in treated and untreated cells was determined by the specific binding of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B (n = 5). The effects of an inhibitor of the gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor was also examined (n= 5). In addition, the effects of the anesthetics on GM1 liposome-induced Alphabeta assembly were investigated (n = 5). Finally, the neurotoxicity of the assembled Alphabeta fibrils was studied by the lactate dehydrogenase release assay (n = 6). RESULTS: Propofol (31.2 +- 4.7%) and thiopental (34.6 +- 10.5%) decreased GM1 expression on the cell surface through the gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor. The anesthetics inhibited Alphabeta fibril formation from soluble Alphabeta in cultured neurons. Moreover, propofol and thiopental suppressed GM1-induced fibril formation in a cell-free system (propofol, 75.8 +- 1.9%; thiopental, 83.6 +- 1.9%) and reduced the neurotoxicity of a mixture containing Abeta and GM1 liposomes (propofol, 35.3 +- 16.4%; thiopental, 21.3 +- 11.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Propofol and thiopental have direct and indirect inhibitory effects on Alphabeta fibrillogenesis.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that vascular amyloid contributes to chronic brain ischemia, therefore amyloid burden measured by Pittsburgh compound B retention on positron emission tomography (PiB PET) would correlate with the extent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) white matter hyperintensities (WMH; or leukoaraiosis) in patients with high vascular amyloid deposition (cerebral amyloid angiopathy [CAA]) but not in patients with high parenchymal amyloid deposition (Alzheimer disease [AD]; mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) or in healthy elderly (HE) subjects. METHODS: Forty-two nondemented CAA patients, 50 HE subjects, and 43 AD/MCI patients had brain MRI and PiB PET. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the independent association between PiB retention and white matter disease volume, controlling for age, gender, apolipoprotein E genotype, and vascular risk factors within each group. RESULTS: CAA patients were younger than HE and AD subjects (68 +- 10 vs 73.3 +- 7 and 74 +- 7.4, p < 0.01) but had higher amounts of WMH (median = 21 vs 3.2 and 10.8 ml, respectively, p < 0.05 for both comparisons). Global PiB retention and WMH showed strong correlation (rho = 0.52, p < 0.001) in the CAA group but not in HE or AD. These associations did not change in the multivariate models. Lobar microbleed count, another marker of CAA severity, also remained as an independent predictor of WMH volume. INTERPRETATION: Our results indicate that amyloid burden in CAA subjects (with primarily vascular amyloid) but not AD subjects (with primarily parenchymal amyloid) independently correlates with WMH volume. These findings support the idea that vascular amyloid burden directly contributes to chronic cerebral ischemia and highlights the possible utility of amyloid imaging as a marker of CAA severity.",

Huperzine A, a novel lycopodium alkaloid isolated from traditional Chinese medicine Huperzia serrata (Qian Ceng Ta), has been shown to possess multiple neuroprotective effects for Alzheimer's disease, but the precise pharmacological mechanism of huperzine A is unclear and needs to be further investigated. In this study, proteins from untreated N2a cells (Con group), cells preincubated with huperzine A followed by Abeta (1-42) oligomers treatment (HupA group) and cells treated with Abeta (1-42) oligomers (Abeta group) with five biological replicates in each cohort, were processed in a centrifugal proteomic reactor and quantified by label-free quantitation. A total of 2860 proteins were quantified with high confidence, and 198 proteins were significantly changed (with p-value < 0.05) between HupA and Abeta cohorts. The pathway and direct protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that huperzine A protects N2a cells against Abeta oligomer-induced cell death by downregulation of cellular tumor antigen p53 (Trp53) expression.",

A plethora of chemical entities able to modulate Abeta(42) self-assembly have been developed in recent years, among them, several are in clinical or preclinical development. AREAS COVERED: This review accounts for small-molecule inhibitors of Abeta peptide polymerization and toxicity, reported in the patent literature during the 2010 - 2012 period, and their potential use as disease-modifying therapeutics for AD cure. EXPERT OPINION: The earliest pathogenic event is the formation of soluble Abeta oligomers that disrupt synaptic communication. Drug design strategies targeting these primary toxic agents could hold considerable promises for obtaining effective anti-AD drugs candidate. The heterogeneous aggregation of Abeta and the resulting difficulty to structurally characterize the peptide represent important drawbacks.",

    "abstract": "Despite the significance of Alzheimer's disease, the link between metal-associated amyloid-beta (metal-Abeta) and disease etiology remains unclear. To elucidate this relationship, chemical tools capable of specifically targeting and modulating metal-Abeta species are necessary, along with a fundamental understanding of their mechanism at the molecular level. Herein, we investigated and compared the interactions and reactivities of the green tea extract, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate [(2R,3R)-5,7-dihydroxy-2-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-3-yl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate; EGCG], with metal [Cu(II) and Zn(II)]-Abeta and metal-free Abeta species. We found that EGCG interacted with metal-Abeta species and formed small, unstructured Abeta aggregates more noticeably than in metal-free conditions in vitro. In addition, upon incubation with EGCG, the toxicity presented by metal-free Abeta and metal-Abeta was mitigated in living cells. To understand this reactivity at the molecular level, structural insights were obtained by ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS), 2D NMR spectroscopy, and computational methods. These studies indicated that (i) EGCG was bound to Abeta monomers and dimers, generating more compact peptide conformations than those from EGCG-untreated Abeta species; and (ii) ternary EGCG-metal-Abeta complexes were produced. Thus, we demonstrate the distinct antiamyloidogenic reactivity of EGCG toward metal-Abeta species with a structure-based mechanism.",

To this end, human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting the alpha7 nAChR subunit and/or exposed to Abeta1-42. For alpha7 nAChR, BACE1 (cleaving at the beta-site of APP) and BACE2 (cleaving within the Abeta domain), alpha-secretase (ADAM10), and the two components of gamma-secretase, PS and NCT, the mRNA and protein levels were determined by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The level of Abeta1-42 in the cell culture medium was determined by an ELISA procedure. The extent of lipid peroxidation and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were assayed spectrophotometrically. In the transfected SH-SY5Y cells, expression of alpha7 nAChR was reduced; the level of BACE1 increased and that of BACE2 decreased; the amount of ADAM10 lowered; and the level of PS raised. Moreover, the level of Abeta1-42 in the culture medium was elevated. Treatment of non-transfected cells with Abeta elevated the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and lowered the activities of SOD and GSH-Px and these changes were potentiated by inhibiting expression of alpha7 nAChR. These results indicate that alpha7 nAChR plays a significant role in amyloidogenic metabolism of APP and the oxidative stress evoked by Abeta, suggesting that this receptor might help protect against the neurotoxicity of Abeta.",

    "title": "Binding of apolipoprotein E inhibits the oligomer growth of amyloid-beta peptide in solution as determined by fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy.",
    "abstract": "One of the primary neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease is the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques resulting from the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. The intrinsic disorder of the Abeta peptide drives self-association and progressive reordering of the conformation in solution, and this dynamic distribution of Abeta complicates biophysical studies. This property poses a challenge for understanding the interaction of Abeta with apolipoprotein E (apoE). ApoE plays a pivotal role in the aggregation and clearance of Abeta peptides in the brain, and the epsilon4 allele of APOE is the most significant known genetic modulator of Alzheimer risk. Understanding the interaction between apoE and Abeta will provide insight into the mechanism by which different apoE isoforms determine Alzheimer disease risk. Here we applied alternating laser excitation fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy to observe the single molecule interaction of Abeta with apoE in the hydrated state. The diffusion time of freely diffusing Abeta in the absence of apoE shows significant self-aggregation, whereas in the presence of apoE, binding of the protein results in a more stable complex. These results show that apoE slows down the oligomerization of Abeta in solution and provide direct insight into the process by which apoE influences the deposition and clearance of Abeta peptides in the brain. Furthermore, by developing an approach to remove signals arising from very large Abeta aggregates, we show that real-time single particle observations provide access to information regarding the fraction of apoE bound and the stoichiometry of apoE and Abeta in the complex.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms by which beta-amyloid (Abeta), a peptide fragment believed to contribute to Alzheimer's disease, leads to synaptic deficits are not known. Here we find that elevated oligomeric Abeta requires ion flux-independent function of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) to produce synaptic depression. Abeta activates this metabotropic NMDAR function on GluN2B-containing NMDARs but not on those containing GluN2A. Furthermore, oligomeric Abeta leads to a selective loss of synaptic GluN2B responses, effecting a switch in subunit composition from GluN2B to GluN2A, a process normally observed during development. Our results suggest that conformational changes of the NMDAR, and not ion flow through its channel, are required for Abeta to produce synaptic depression and a switch in NMDAR composition. This Abeta-induced signaling mediated by alterations in GluN2B conformation may be a target for therapeutic intervention of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "A synthetic peptide corresponding to a region of the human pericentriolar material 1 (PCM-1) protein binds beta-amyloid (Abeta1-42 ) oligomers.",
    "abstract": "We have recently reported that a ~19-kDa polypeptide, rPK-4, is a protein kinase Cs inhibitor that is 89% homologous to the 1171-1323 amino acid region of the 228-kDa human pericentriolar material-1 (PCM-1) protein (Chakravarthy et al. 2012). We have now discovered that rPK-4 binds oligomeric amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta)1-42 with high affinity. Most importantly, a PCM-1-selective antibody co-precipitated Abeta and amyloid beta precursor protein (AbetaPP) from cerebral cortices and hippocampi from AD (Alzheimer's disease) transgenic mice that produce human AbetaPP and Abeta1-42 , suggesting that PCM-1 may interact with amyloid precursor protein/Abeta in vivo. We have identified rPK-4's Abeta-binding domain using a set of overlapping synthetic peptides. We have found with ELISA, dot-blot, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis techniques that a ~ 5 kDa synthetic peptide, amyloid binding peptide (ABP)-p4-5 binds Abeta1-42 at nM levels. Most importantly, ABP-p4-5, like rPK-4, appears to preferentially bind Abeta1-42 oligomers, believed to be the toxic AD-drivers. As expected from these observations, ABP-p4-5 prevented Abeta1-42 from killing human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells via apoptosis. These findings indicate that ABP-p4-5 is a possible candidate therapeutic for AD.",

    "abstract": "Deposition of beta -amyloid (Abeta) peptides, cleavage products of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase-1 (BACE1) and gamma-secretase, is a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). gamma-Secretase inhibition is a therapeutical anti-Abeta approach, although changes in the enzyme's activity in AD brain are unclear. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta peptides are thought to derive from brain parenchyma and thus may serve as biomarkers for assessing cerebral amyloidosis and anti-Abeta efficacy. The present study compared active gamma-secretase binding sites with Abeta deposition in aged and AD human cerebrum, and explored the possibility of Abeta production and secretion by the choroid plexus (CP). The specific binding density of [(3) H]-L-685,458, a radiolabeled high-affinity gamma-secretase inhibitor, in the temporal neocortex and hippocampal formation was similar for AD and control cases with similar ages and post-mortem delays. The CP in post-mortem samples exhibited exceptionally high [(3) H]-L-685,458 binding density, with the estimated maximal binding sites (Bmax) reduced in the AD relative to control groups. Surgically resected human CP exhibited APP, BACE1 and presenilin-1 immunoreactivity, and beta-site APP cleavage enzymatic activity. In primary culture, human CP cells also expressed these amyloidogenic proteins and released Abeta40 and Abeta42 into the medium. Overall, our results suggest that gamma-secretase activity appears unaltered in the cerebrum in AD and is not correlated with regional amyloid plaque pathology. The CP appears to be a previously unrecognised non-neuronal contributor to CSF Abeta, probably at reduced levels in AD.",

    "title": "Immunogenic properties of amyloid beta oligomers.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The central molecule in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is believed to be a small-sized polypeptide - beta amyloid (Abeta) which has an ability to assemble spontaneously into oligomers. Various studies concerning therapeutic and prophylactic approaches for AD are based on the immunotherapy using antibodies against Abeta. It has been suggested that either active immunization with Abeta or passive immunization with anti-Abeta antibodies might help to prevent or reduce the symptoms of the disease. However, knowledge on the mechanisms of Abeta-induced immune response is rather limited. Previous research on Abeta1-42 oligomers in rat brain cultures showed that the neurotoxicity of these oligomers considerably depends on their size. In the current study, we evaluated the dependence of immunogenicity of Abeta1-42 oligomers on the size of oligomeric particles and identified the immunodominant epitopes of the oligomers. RESULTS: Mice were immunized with various Abeta1-42 oligomers. The analysis of serum antibodies revealed that small Abeta1-42 oligomers (1-2 nm in size) are highly immunogenic. They induced predominantly IgG2b and IgG2a responses. In contrast, larger Abeta1-42 oligomers and monomers induced weaker IgG response in immunized mice. The monoclonal antibody against 1-2 nm Abeta1-42 oligomers was generated and used for antigenic characterization of Abeta1-42 oligomers. Epitope mapping of both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies demonstrated that the main immunodominant region of the 1-2 nm Abeta1-42 oligomers is located at the amino-terminus (N-terminus) of the peptide, between amino acids 1 and 19. CONCLUSIONS: Small Abeta1-42 oligomers of size 1-2 nm induce the strongest immune response in mice. The N-terminus of Abeta1-42 oligomers represents an immunodominant region which indicates its surface localization and accessibility to the B cells. The results of the current study may be important for further development of Abeta-based vaccination and immunotherapy strategies.",

    "abstract": "Oligomeric forms of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) are thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanism involved is still unclear. Here, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from familial and sporadic AD patients and differentiated them into neural cells. Abeta oligomers accumulated in iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes in cells from patients with a familial amyloid precursor protein (APP)-E693Delta mutation and sporadic AD, leading to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress. The accumulated Abeta oligomers were not proteolytically resistant, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) treatment alleviated the stress responses in the AD neural cells. Differential manifestation of ER stress and DHA responsiveness may help explain variable clinical results obtained with the use of DHA treatment and suggests that DHA may in fact be effective for a subset of patients. It also illustrates how patient-specific iPSCs can be useful for analyzing AD pathogenesis and evaluating drugs.",

    "title": "Brain-wide pathway for waste clearance captured by contrast-enhanced MRI.",
    "abstract": "The glymphatic system is a recently defined brain-wide paravascular pathway for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid (ISF) exchange that facilitates efficient clearance of solutes and waste from the brain. CSF enters the brain along para-arterial channels to exchange with ISF, which is in turn cleared from the brain along para-venous pathways. Because soluble amyloid beta clearance depends on glymphatic pathway function, we proposed that failure of this clearance system contributes to amyloid plaque deposition and Alzheimer's disease progression. Here we provide proof of concept that glymphatic pathway function can be measured using a clinically relevant imaging technique. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was used to visualize CSF-ISF exchange across the rat brain following intrathecal paramagnetic contrast agent administration. Key features of glymphatic pathway function were confirmed, including visualization of para-arterial CSF influx and molecular size-dependent CSF-ISF exchange. Whole-brain imaging allowed the identification of two key influx nodes at the pituitary and pineal gland recesses, while dynamic MRI permitted the definition of simple kinetic parameters to characterize glymphatic CSF-ISF exchange and solute clearance from the brain. We propose that this MRI approach may provide the basis for a wholly new strategy to evaluate Alzheimer's disease susceptibility and progression in the live human brain.",

    "abstract": "Imbalanced lipid metabolism and increase in the ceramide-to-S1P ratio in the brain have been postulated to play a role in amyloidogenesis, neuroinflammatory reactions, and neuronal apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. FTY720, the immunomodulatory sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) analog, has recently gained interest because of its CNS-directed effects. In addition to its immunomodulatory functions in multiple sclerosis, FTY720 possesses anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective roles in different cerebral ischemia models. In the present study, we examined the effects of FTY720 in a rat model of AD. Memory deficit was induced by bilateral intrahippocampus injection of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta(42)) and examined through the Morris water maze test. The extent of histological injury in the hippocampus and the activation of caspase-3 were determined respectively by Nissl staining and Western blotting. Chronic daily administration of FTY720 (1 mg/kg, i.p., 14 days) significantly attenuated the Abeta(42)-induced learning and memory impairment and prevented the hippocampus neuronal damage as well as caspase-3 activation. These data show for the first time that FTY720 has a beneficial effect in restoring memory loss in Abeta(42)-induced neurotoxicity and also suggest that S1P receptors and signaling pathways may provide a potential target for the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid proteins aggregate into polymorphic fibrils that damage tissues of the brain, nerves, and heart. Experimental and computational studies have examined the structural basis and the nucleation of short fibrils, but the ability to predict and precisely quantify the stability of larger aggregates has remained elusive. We established a complete classification of fibril shapes and developed a tool called CreateFibril to build such complex, polymorphic, modular structures automatically. We applied stability landscapes, a technique we developed to reveal reliable fibril structural parameters, to assess fibril stability. CreateFibril constructed HET-s, Abeta, and amylin fibrils up to 17 nm in length, and utilized a novel dipolar solvent model that captured the effect of dipole-dipole interactions between water and very large molecular systems to assess their aqueous stability. Our results validate experimental data for HET-s and Abeta, and suggest novel (to our knowledge) findings for amylin. In particular, we predicted the correct structural parameters (rotation angles, packing distances, hydrogen bond lengths, and helical pitches) for the one and three predominant HET-s protofilaments. We reveal and structurally characterize all known Abeta polymorphic fibrils, including structures recently classified as wrapped fibrils. Finally, we elucidate the predominant amylin fibrils and assert that native amylin is more stable than its amyloid form. CreateFibril and a database of all stable polymorphic fibril models we tested, along with their structural energy landscapes, are available at http://amyloid.cs.mcgill.ca.",

    "abstract": "Soluble oligomers of the amyloid-beta peptide have been implicated as proximal neurotoxins in Alzheimer's disease. However, the identity of the neurotoxic aggregate(s) and the mechanisms by which these species induce neuronal dysfunction remain uncertain. Physiologically relevant experimentation is hindered by the low endogenous concentrations of the peptide, the metastability of Abeta oligomers, and the wide range of observed interactions between Abeta and biological membranes. Single-molecule microscopy represents one avenue for overcoming these challenges. Using this technique, we find that Abeta binds to primary rat hippocampal neurons at physiological concentrations. Although amyloid-beta(1-40) as well as amyloid-beta(1-42) initially form larger oligomers on neurites than on glass slides, a 1:1 mix of the two peptides result in smaller neurite-bound oligomers than those detected on-slide or for either peptide alone. With 1 nM peptide in solution, Abeta40 oligomers do not grow over the course of 48 h, Abeta42 oligomers grow slightly, and oligomers of a 1:1 mix grow substantially. Evidently, small Abeta oligomers are capable of binding to neurons at physiological concentrations and grow at rates dependent on local Abeta42:Abeta40 ratios. These results are intriguing in light of the increased Abeta42:Abeta40 ratios shown to correlate with familial Alzheimer's disease mutations.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an environmental risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increased brain concentrations of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF) are shared pathologic features of TBI and AD and promising therapeutic targets. We used arterial spin-labeling magnetic resonance imaging to examine if CBF changes after TBI are influenced by human Abeta and amenable to simvastatin therapy. CBF was measured 3 days and 3 weeks after controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury in transgenic human Abeta-expressing APP(NLh/NLh) mice compared to murine Abeta-expressing C57Bl/6J wild types. Compared to uninjured littermates, CBF was reduced in the cortex of the injured hemisphere in both Abeta transgenics and wild types; deficits were more pronounced in the transgenic group, which exhibited injury-induced increased concentrations of human Abeta. In the hemisphere contralateral to CCI, CBF levels were stable in Abeta transgenic mice but increased in wild-type mice, both relative to uninjured littermates. Post-injury treatment of Abeta transgenic mice with simvastatin lowered brain Abeta concentrations, attenuated deficits in CBF ipsilateral to injury, restored hyperemia contralateral to injury, and reduced brain tissue loss. Future studies examining long-term effects of simvastatin therapy on CBF and chronic neurodegenerative changes after TBI are warranted.",

    "title": "Aminothienopyridazines and methylene blue affect Tau fibrillization via cysteine oxidation.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease and several other neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the accumulation of intraneuronal fibrils comprised of the protein Tau. Tau is normally a soluble protein that stabilizes microtubules, with splice isoforms that contain either three (3-R) or four (4-R) microtubule binding repeats. The formation of Tau fibrils is thought to result in neuronal damage, and inhibitors of Tau fibrillization may hold promise as therapeutic agents. The process of Tau fibrillization can be replicated in vitro, and a number of small molecules have been identified that inhibit Tau fibril formation. However, little is known about how these molecules affect Tau fibrillization. Here, we examined the mechanism by which the previously described aminothieno pyridazine (ATPZ) series of compounds inhibit Tau fibrillization. Active ATPZs were found to promote the oxidation of the two cysteine residues within 4-R Tau by a redox cycling mechanism, resulting in the formation of a disulfide-containing compact monomer that was refractory to fibrillization. Moreover, the ATPZs facilitated intermolecular disulfide formation between 3-R Tau monomers, leading to dimers that were capable of fibrillization. The ATPZs also caused cysteine oxidation in molecules unrelated to Tau. Interestingly, methylene blue, an inhibitor of Tau fibrillization under evaluation in Alzheimer disease clinical trials, caused a similar oxidation of cysteines in Tau and other molecules. These findings reveal that the ATPZs and methylene blue act by a mechanism that may affect their viability as potential therapeutic agents.",

    "title": "Brain beta-amyloid load approaches a plateau.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To model the temporal trajectory of beta-amyloid accumulation using serial amyloid PET imaging. METHODS: Participants, aged 70-92 years, were enrolled in either the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (n = 246) or the Mayo Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (n = 14). All underwent 2 or more serial amyloid PET examinations. There were 205 participants classified as cognitively normal and 55 as cognitively impaired (47 mild cognitive impairment and 8 Alzheimer dementia). We measured baseline amyloid PET-relative standardized uptake values (SUVR) and, for each participant, estimated a slope representing their annual amyloid accumulation rate. We then fit regression models to predict the rate of amyloid accumulation given baseline amyloid SUVR, and evaluated age, sex, clinical group, and APOE as covariates. Finally, we integrated the amyloid accumulation rate vs baseline amyloid PET SUVR association to an amyloid PET SUVR vs time association. RESULTS: Rates of amyloid accumulation were low at low baseline SUVR. Rates increased to a maximum at baseline SUVR around 2.0, above which rates declined-reaching zero at baseline SUVR above 2.7. The rate of amyloid accumulation as a function of baseline SUVR had an inverted U shape. Integration produced a sigmoid curve relating amyloid PET SUVR to time. The average estimated time required to travel from an SUVR of 1.5-2.5 is approximately 15 years. CONCLUSION: This roughly 15-year interval where the slope of the amyloid SUVR vs time curve is greatest and roughly linear represents a large therapeutic window for secondary preventive interventions.",

    "abstract": "Oligomeric forms of beta-amyloid (Abeta(42)) peptides associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) disrupt cellular Ca(2+) regulation by liberating Ca(2+) into the cytosol from both extracellular and intracellular sources. We elucidated the actions of intracellular Abeta by imaging Ca(2+) responses to injections of Abeta oligomers into Xenopus oocytes. Two types of signal were observed: (1) local, \"channel-like\" transients dependent on extracellular Ca(2+) influx, which resembled signals from amlyoid pores formed by extracellular application of oligomers; and (2) local transients and global Ca(2+) waves, resembling Ca(2+) puffs and waves mediated by inositol trisphosphate (IP(3)). The latter responses were suppressed by antagonists of the IP(3) receptor (caffeine and heparin), pretreatment with the G(i)(o)-protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, and pretreatment with lithium to deplete membrane inositol lipids. We show that G-protein-mediated stimulation of IP(3) production and consequent liberation of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum by intracellular Abeta oligomers is cytotoxic, potentially representing a novel pathological mechanism in AD which may be further exacerbated by AD-linked mutations in presenilins to promote opening of IP(3) receptor/channels.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta peptides (Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42) cause cerebral degeneration by impairing the activity of angiogenic factors and inducing apoptosis and senescence in the endothelium. Amyloid peptides are known to induce oxidative stress. Impairment of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) following oxidative stress, results in accumulation of toxic aldehydes, particularly 4-hydroxynoneal (4-HNE). We sought to determine the role of mitochondrial ALDH2 in Abeta-related impairment of angiogenesis. We hypothesized that by increasing the detoxification activity of ALDH2 we would reduce Abeta-driven endothelial injuries and restore angiogenesis. We used a selective ALDH2 activator, Alda-1, assessing its ability to repair mitochondrial dysfunction in the endothelium. Treatment of human endothelial cells with Abeta1-40 (5-50 microM) induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased cytochrome c release and ROS accumulation. These events were associated with 4-HNE accumulation and decrease in ALDH2 activity (40%), and resulted in disassembly of endothelial junctions, as evidenced by beta-catenin phosphorylation, disorganization of adherens and tight junctions, and by disruption of pseudocapillary formation. Alda-1 (10-40 microM) abolished Abeta-induced 4-HNE accumulation, apoptosis and vascular leakiness, fully restoring the pro-angiogenic endothelial phenotype and responses to FGF-2. Our data document that mitochondrial ALDH2 in the endothelium is a target for the vascular effect of Abeta, including loss of barrier function and angiogenesis. ALDH2 activation, by restoring mitochondrial functions in the endothelium, prevents Abeta-induced dysfunction and anti-angiogenic effects. Thus, agents activating ALDH2 may reduce endothelial injuries including those occurring in cerebral amyloid angiopathy, preserving the angiogenic potential of the endothelium.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein (ASYN) is a major constituent of the typical protein aggregates observed in several neurodegenerative diseases that are collectively referred to as synucleinopathies. A causal involvement of ASYN in the initiation and progression of neurological diseases is suggested by observations indicating that single-point (e.g., A30P, A53T) or multiplication mutations of the gene encoding for ASYN cause early onset forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). The relative regional specificity of ASYN pathology is still a riddle that cannot be simply explained by its expression pattern. Also, transgenic over-expression of ASYN in mice does not recapitulate the typical dopaminergic neuronal death observed in PD. Thus, additional factors must contribute to ASYN-related toxicity. For instance, synucleinopathies are usually associated with inflammation and elevated levels of oxidative stress in affected brain areas. In turn, these conditions favor oxidative modifications of ASYN. Among these modifications, nitration of tyrosine residues, formation of covalent ASYN dimers, as well as methionine sulfoxidations are prominent examples that are observed in post-mortem PD brain sections. Oxidative modifications can affect ASYN aggregation, as well as its binding to biological membranes. This would affect neurotransmitter recycling, mitochondrial function and dynamics (fission/fusion), ASYN's degradation within a cell and, possibly, the transfer of modified ASYN to adjacent cells. Here, we propose a model on how covalent modifications of ASYN link energy stress, altered proteostasis, and oxidative stress, three major pathogenic processes involved in PD progression. Moreover, we hypothesize that ASYN may act physiologically as a catalytically regenerated scavenger of oxidants in healthy cells, thus performing an important protective role prior to the onset of disease or during aging.",

    "abstract": "The platelet amyloid precursor protein (APP) ratio has recently been shown to be a promising diagnostic marker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). To evaluate its usefulness in Thai patients, platelet APP was analyzed by immunoblotting. The APP ratio was calculated as the ratio of the combined band density of the 120-kD and 130-kD isoforms compared to that of the 110-kD isoform. The mean ages (and ranges) of 27 normal and 13 AD-affected subjects were 68.3 (60-84) and 79.3 (70-97) years, respectively. The Thai Mental State Examination (TMSE) scores demonstrated that the AD patients had significantly poorer cognitive functions than the normal subjects, with mean TMSE scores of 20.3 and 27.6 (maximum score of 30 points), respectively (p<0.05). The platelet APP ratios of the AD patients were significantly lower than those of normal subjects: values (mean +- standard deviation) were 7.32 +- 1.29 and 9.13 +- 3.00, respectively (p<0.05) for AD patients and normal subjects. However, the ranges of the APP ratios from both groups markedly overlapped, which precluded the establishment of a cutoff level to differentiate between the AD and normal subjects. In addition, no significant correlations were observed between the platelet APP ratio and the TMSE score or between the APP ratio and the serum cholesterol in this study, in contrast to previous reports.",

Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been used in combination to monitor Abeta(1-40) aggregation in vitro at both normal and higher than standard concentrations. The observed fibrillation behaviour deviates, in several respects, from standard concepts of the nucleation-polymerisation models and shows such features as concentration-dependent non-linear effects in the assembly mechanism.

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have identified aberrant cortical structure in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The association between MRI-derived cortical morphometry measures and beta-amyloid, however, remains poorly understood. In this study, we explored the potential relationship between early alterations in cortical thickness and later stage beta-amyloid deposition, using a novel approach, in a transgenic AD mouse model. We acquired longitudinal anatomical MRI scans from mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice and age-matched wild-type mice at 1 and 3.5months-of-age, and employed fully-automated image processing methods to derive objective, quantitative measures of cortical thickness on a region-of-interest basis. We also generated 3D quantitative immunohistochemistry (qIHC) volumes of deposited beta-amyloid burden from 18month-old transgenic mice using an automated, production-level process. These studies revealed thinner cortex in most regions in the 1month-old transgenic mice relative to age-matched wild-types, with the exception of the frontal, perirhinal/entorhinal, posterior cingulate, and retrosplenial cortical regions. Between 1 and 3.5months-of-age, the transgenic mice demonstrated stable or increasing cortical thickness, while the wild-type mice showed cortical thinning. Based on data from co-registered 3D MRI and qIHC volumes, we identified an association between abnormal, early, regional cortical thickness change over 2.5months and later beta-amyloid deposition. These observations suggest that the spatio-temporal pattern of early (pre-plaque) alterations in cerebral cortical structure is indicative of regional predisposition to later beta-amyloid pathology in a transgenic AD mouse model.",

The choroid plexus in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is burdened with amyloid deposits and hosts neuronal progenitor cells. However, neurogenesis in this brain tissue is not firmly established. To investigate this issue further, we examined the effect of Abeta on the neuronal differentiation of choroid plexus epithelial cells in several experimental models of AD. Here we show that Abeta regulates neurogenesis in vitro in cultured choroid plexus epithelial cells as well as in vivo in the choroid plexus of APP/Ps1 mice. Treatment with oligomeric Abeta increased proliferation and differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells in cultured choroid plexus epithelial cells, but decreased survival of newly born neurons. These Abeta-induced neurogenic effects were also observed in choroid plexus of APP/PS1 mice, and detected also in autopsy tissue from AD patients. Analysis of signaling pathways revealed that pre-treating the choroid plexus epithelial cells with specific inhibitors of TyrK or MAPK diminished Abeta-induced neuronal proliferation. Taken together, our results support a role of Abeta in proliferation and differentiation in the choroid plexus epithelial cells in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Evidence is emerging that during the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), changes in the synthesis and metabolism of cholesterol and progesterone are occurring that may or may not affect the progression of the disease. The concept arose from the recognition that dehydrocholesterol 24-reductase (DHCR24/Seladin-1), one of the nine enzymes in the endoplasmic reticulum that determines the transformation of lanosterol to cholesterol, is selectively reduced in late AD. As a consequence, the tissue level of desmosterol increases, affecting the expression of ABC transporters and the structure of lipid rafts, both determinants of amyloid-beta processing. However, the former effect is considered beneficial and the latter detrimental to processing. Other determinants of desmosterol tissue levels are 24,25 epoxycholesterol and the ABCG1 and ABCG4 transporters. Progesterone and its metabolites are determinants of tissue levels of desmosterol and several other sterol intermediates in cholesterol synthesis. Animal models indicate marked elevations in the tissue levels of these sterols at early time frames in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. The low level of neuroprogesterone and metabolites in AD are consonant with the low level of desmosterol and may have a role in amyloid-beta processing. The sparse data that has accumulated appears to be a sufficient basis for proposing a systematic evaluation of the biologic roles of sterol intermediates in the slowly progressive neurodegeneration characteristic of AD.",

    "abstract": "The aspartyl protease BACE1 cleaves neuregulin 1 and is involved in myelination and is a candidate drug target for Alzheimer's disease, where it acts as the beta-secretase cleaving the amyloid precursor protein. However, little is known about other substrates in vivo. Here, we provide a proteomic workflow for BACE1 substrate identification from whole brains, combining filter-aided sample preparation, strong-anion exchange fractionation, and label-free quantification. We used bace1-deficient zebrafish and quantified differences in protein levels between wild-type and bace1 -/- zebrafish brains. Over 4500 proteins were identified with at least two unique peptides and quantified in both wild-type and bace1 -/- zebrafish brains. The majority of zebrafish membrane proteins did not show altered protein levels, indicating that Bace1 has a restricted substrate specificity. Twenty-four membrane proteins accumulated in the bace1 -/- brains and thus represent candidate Bace1 substrates. They include several known BACE1 substrates, such as the zebrafish homologs of amyloid precursor protein and the cell adhesion protein L1, which validate the proteomic workflow. Additionally, several candidate substrates with a function in neurite outgrowth and axon guidance, such as plexin A3 and glypican-1 were identified, pointing to a function of Bace1 in neurodevelopment. Taken together, our study provides the first proteomic analysis of knock-out zebrafish tissue and demonstrates that combining gene knock-out models in zebrafish with quantitative proteomics is a powerful approach to address biomedical questions.",

MS/DB cholinergic neurons degenerate early in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The presence of MS/DB glutamatergic neurons that project to the hippocampus and are vulnerable to Abeta suggests that excitotoxicity plays a role in AD septal degeneration and hippocampal dysfunction. To demonstrate the presence of excitotoxicity in Abeta-induced septal damage, we compared rats injected with Abeta1-40 into the MS/DB with animals treated with memantine prior, during and after Abeta1-40 injections. Controls were injected with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). MS/DB cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons were immunochemically identified. The number of MS/DB neurons was estimated using stereology. Our results show that memantine blocks Abeta1-40-induced septal damage and suggest that excitotoxicity plays a role in basal forebrain neurodegeneration.",

    "title": "Inflammatory mediators induced by amyloid-beta in the retina and RPE in vivo: implications for inflammasome activation in age-related macular degeneration.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Drusen are hallmarks of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Amyloid-beta 1-40 (Abeta 1-40), a constituent of drusen, is known to stimulate inflammatory pathways in RPE; however, its effect in vivo is not known. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of Abeta 1-40 on cytokine expression and inflammasome activation relevant to AMD in an animal model. METHODS: Wild-type rats received intravitreal injections of Abeta 1-40, and eyes were taken at days 1, 4, 14, and 49 postinjection. The RPE, neuroretina, and vitreous were analyzed for cytokine expression, inflammasome activation, and microglial response via RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and suspension array assay. Retinal cell loss was assessed via apoptotic markers and retinal thickness. RESULTS: Abeta 1-40 stimulated upregulation of IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-18, caspase-1, NLRP3, and XAF1 genes in the RPE/choroid and the neuroretina. Increased IL-1beta and IL-6 immunoreactivity was found in retinal sections, and elevated levels of IL-1beta and IL-18 were found in the vitreous of Abeta-injected eyes. Abeta 1-40 induced a moderate increase in CD11b/c-reactive cells on day 1 postinjection only. No evidence of the proapoptotic XAF1 protein, p53, TUNEL immunoreactivity, or retinal thinning was observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm earlier in vitro work and support the proinflammatory role of drusen component Abeta 1-40 in the RPE and retina. Inflammasome activation may be responsible for this effect in vivo. This model is useful for understanding cellular triggers of inflammasome activation and proposed early inflammatory events in the outer retina associated with the etiology of AMD.",

    "abstract": "Aluminium and zinc are known to be the major triggering agents for aggregation of amyloid peptides leading to plaque formation in Alzheimer's disease. While zinc binding to histidine in Abeta (amyloid beta) fragments has been implicated as responsible for aggregation, not much information is available on the interaction of aluminium with histidine. In the NMR study of the N-terminal Abeta fragments, DAEFRHDSGYEV (Abeta12) and DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQK (Abeta16) presented here, the interactions of the fragments with aluminium have been investigated. Significant chemical shifts were observed for few residues near the C-terminus when aluminium chloride was titrated with Abeta12 and Abeta16 peptides. Surprisingly, it is nonhistidine residues which seem to be involved in aluminium binding. Based on NMR constrained structure obtained by molecular modelling, aluminium-binding pockets in Abeta12 were around charged residues such as Asp, Glu. The results are discussed in terms of native structure propagation, and the relevance of histidine residues in the sequences for metal-binding interactions. We expect that the study of such short amyloid peptide fragments will not only provide clues for plaque formation in aggregated conditions but also facilitate design of potential drugs for these targets.",

    "title": "Retinal ganglion cell dendritic degeneration in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) may be regarded as a target biomarker in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We therefore explored the possibility that RGC degeneration, rather than cell loss, is an early marker of neuronal degeneration in a murine model of AD. RGC dendritic morphology and dendritic spine densities of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons were quantified in 14-month-old transgenic mice expressing the APP(SWE) (amyloid precusor protein-Swedish mutation) mutation (Tg2576). The dendritic integrity of RGCs was found to be significantly reduced in the absence of significant RGC loss in Tg2576 mice compared with age-matched wild-type controls. In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, we observed dendritic spines to be present at a lower frequency from the same animals, but this did not reach significance. Synaptic and mitochondrial protein expression markers (PSD95 [postsynaptic density protein 95], synaptophysin, and Mfn2 [mitofusin 2]) showed no significant changes in RGC synaptic densities but a highly significant change in mitochondrial morphology with a marked reduction in the integrity of the mitochondrial cristae. Our findings suggest that, in a well-characterized mouse model of AD, RGC dendritic atrophy precedes cell loss, and this change may be because of accumulations of amyloid-beta. Because RGC dendrites are confined to the inner plexiform layer of the retina, imaging techniques that focus on this layer, rather than the loss of RGCs, may provide a sensitive biomarker for monitoring neural damage in AD.",

    "title": "Deletion of Abca7 increases cerebral amyloid-beta accumulation in the J20 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) is expressed in the brain and has been detected in macrophages, microglia, and neurons. ABCA7 promotes efflux of lipids from cells to apolipoproteins and can also regulate phagocytosis and modulate processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate the Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. Genome-wide association studies have indicated that ABCA7 single nucleotide polymorphisms confer increased risk for late-onset AD; however, the role that ABCA7 plays in the brain in the AD context is unknown. In the present study, we crossed ABCA7-deficient (A7(-/-)) mice with J20 amyloidogenic mice to address this issue. We show that ABCA7 loss doubled insoluble Abeta levels and thioflavine-S-positive plaques in the brain. This was not related to changes in APP processing (assessed by analysis of full-length APP and the APP beta C-terminal fragment). Apolipoprotein E regulates cerebral Abeta homeostasis and plaque load; however, the apolipoprotein E concentration was not altered by ABCA7 loss. Spatial reference memory was significantly impaired in both J20 and J20/A7(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice; however, there were no cognitive differences between J20 and J20/A7(-/-) mice. There were also no major differences detected in hippocampal or plaque-associated microglial/macrophage markers between J20 and J20/A7(-/-) mice, whereas the capacity for bone marrow-derived macrophages derived from A7(-/-) mice to take up oligomeric Abeta was reduced by 51% compared with wild-type mice. Our results suggest that ABCA7 plays a role in the regulation of Abeta homeostasis in the brain and that this may be related to altered phagocyte function.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) brain is characterized by extracellular plaques of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide with reactive microglia. This study aimed to determine whether a dietary intervention could attenuate microgliosis. Memory was assessed in 12-mo-old male amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice via Barnes maze testing followed by division into either a control-fed group provided free access to normal chow and water or a treatment group provided free access to normal chow and drinking water supplemented with pomegranate extract (6.25 mL/L) for 3 mo followed by repeat Barnes maze testing for both groups. Three months of pomegranate feeding decreased the path length to escape of mice compared with their initial 12-mo values (P < 0.05) and their control-fed counterparts (P < 0.05). Brains of the 3-mo study pomegranate-fed mice had lower tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations (P < 0.05) and lower nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) transcriptional activity (P < 0.05) compared with controls. Brains of the 3-mo pomegranate or control mice were also compared with an additional control group of 12-mo-old mice for histologic analysis. Immunocytochemistry showed that pomegranate- but not control-fed mice had attenuated microgliosis (P < 0.05) and Abeta plaque deposition (P < 0.05) compared with 12-mo-old mice. An additional behavioral study again used 12-mo-old male APP/PS1 mice tested by T-maze followed by division into a control group provided with free access to normal chow and sugar supplemented drinking water or a treatment group provided with normal chow and pomegranate extract-supplemented drinking water (6.25 mL/L) for 1 mo followed by repeat T-maze testing in both groups. One month of pomegranate feeding increased spontaneous alternations versus control-fed mice (P < 0.05). Cell culture experiments verified that 2 polyphenol components of pomegranate extract, punicalagin and ellagic acid, attenuated NFAT activity in a reporter cell line (P < 0.05) and decreased Abeta-stimulated TNF-alpha secretion by murine microglia (P < 0.05). These data indicate that dietary pomegranate produces brain antiinflammatory effects that may attenuate AD progression.",

Because of the key role of neurovascular dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we hypothesized neurovascular tissue might be one neuroprotective target of SIF. In the present study, learning and memory ability, beta-amyloid (Abeta) expressions both in neurovascular tissue and plasma, the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)-1, nuclear factor-kappaB p65 (NF-kappaB p65), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) expressions in neurovascular tissue were measured in Wistar rats following lateral cerebral ventricle administration of Abeta1-42 by miniosmotic pump with or without intragastric administration of SIF from 14 days before surgery to the end of experiment. The results showed that SIF could improve the impairment of learning and memory of rats induced by Abeta1-42, maintain Abeta homeostasis in brain, regulate the disordered expressions of RAGE/LRP-1 and restrain RAGE related NF-kappaB and inflammatory cytokines activation in neurovascular structure. These results suggested that SIF could protect Abeta-impaired learning and memory in rats, and its mechanism might be associated with the regulation of vascular Abeta transportation and vascular inflammatory reaction.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography biomarkers accurately predict an underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology; however, they represent either invasive or expensive diagnostic tools. Therefore, a blood-based biomarker like plasma amyloid beta (Abeta) that could correlate with the underlying AD pathology and serve as a prognostic biomarker or an AD screening strategy is urgently needed as a cost-effective and non-invasive diagnostic tool. In this paper we review the demographic, biologic, genetic and technical aspects that affect plasma Abeta levels. Findings of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of plasma Abeta, including autosomal dominant AD cases, sporadic AD cases, Down syndrome cases and population studies, are also discussed. Finally, we review the association between cerebrovascular disease and Abeta plasma levels and the responses observed in clinical trials. Based on our review of the current literature on plasma Abeta, we conclude that further clinical research and assay development are needed before measures of plasma Abeta can be interpreted so they can be applied as trait, risk or state biomarkers for AD.",

    "abstract": "The deposition of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) in the cerebral vasculature, a condition known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, is increasingly recognized as an important component leading to intracerebral hemorrhage, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer disease (AD) and related disorders. Recent studies demonstrated a role for the bradykinin B1 receptor (B1R) in cognitive deficits induced by Abeta in mice; however, its involvement in AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy is poorly understood. Herein, we investigated the effect of B1R inhibition on AD-like neuroinflammation and amyloidosis using the transgenic mouse model (Tg-SwDI). B1R expression was found to be up-regulated in brains of Tg-SwDI mice, specifically in the vasculature, neurons, and astrocytes. Notably, administration of the B1R antagonist, R715, to 8-month-old Tg-SwDI mice for 8 weeks resulted in higher Abeta40 levels and increased thioflavin S-positive fibrillar Abeta deposition. Moreover, blockage of B1R inhibited neuroinflammation, as evidenced by the decreased accumulation of activated microglia and reactive astrocytes, diminished NF-kappaB activation, and reduced cytokine and chemokine levels. Together, our results indicate that B1R activation plays an important role in limiting the accumulation of Abeta in AD-like brain, likely through the regulation of activated glial cell accumulation and release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Therefore, the modulation of the receptor may represent a novel therapeutic approach for AD.",

Biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have long been sought in the blood, but none has become an established or validated diagnostic test. Companion reviews in Alzheimer's Research & Therapy will review specific types of biomarkers or applications; in this overview, we cover key concepts related to AD blood biomarker studies in general. Reasons for the difficulty of detecting markers of a brain-specific disorder, such as AD, in the blood are outlined; these pose conceptual challenges for blood biomarker discovery and development. Applications of blood tests in AD go beyond screening and diagnostic testing; other potential uses are risk assessment, prognostication, and evaluation of treatment target engagement, toxicity, and outcome. Opportunities and questions that may surround these different uses are discussed. A systematic approach to biomarker discovery, detection, assay development and quality control, sample collection, handling and storage, and design and analysis of clinical studies needs to be implemented at every step of discovery and translation to identify an interpretable and useful biomarker.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: (18)F-florbetaben is a novel (18)F-labeled tracer for PET imaging of beta-amyloid deposits in the human brain. We evaluated the kinetic model-based approaches to the quantification of beta-amyloid binding in the brain from dynamic PET data. The validity of the practically useful tissue ratio was also evaluated against the model-based parameters. METHODS: (18)F-florbetaben PET imaging was performed with concurrent multiple arterial sampling after tracer injection (300 MBq) in 10 Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and 10 age-matched healthy controls. Regional brain-tissue time-activity curves for 90 min were analyzed by a 1-tissue-compartment model and a 2-tissue-compartment model (2TCM) with metabolite-corrected plasma data estimating the specific distribution volume (VS) and distribution volume ratio (DVR [2TCM]) and a multilinear reference tissue model estimating DVR (DVR [MRTM]) using the cerebellar cortex as the reference tissue. Target-to-reference tissue standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) at 70-90 min were also calculated. RESULTS: All brain regions required 2TCM to describe the time-activity curves. All beta-amyloid binding parameters in the cerebral cortex (VS, DVR [2TCM], DVR [MRTM], and SUVR) were significantly increased in AD patients (P < 0.05), and there were significant linear correlations among these parameters (r(2) > 0.83). Effect sizes in group discrimination between 8 beta-amyloid-positive AD scans and 9 beta-amyloid-negative healthy control scans for all binding parameters were excellent, being largest for DVR (2TCM) (4.22) and smallest for VS (3.25) and intermediate and the same for DVR (MRTM) and SUVR (4.03). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that compartment kinetic model-based quantification of beta-amyloid binding from (18)F-florbetaben PET data is feasible and that all beta-amyloid binding parameters including SUVR are excellent in discriminating between beta-amyloid-positive and -negative scans.",

    "abstract": "A central question about human brain aging is whether cognitive enrichment slows the development of Alzheimer changes. Here, we show that prolonged exposure to an enriched environment (EE) facilitated signaling in the hippocampus of wild-type mice that promoted long-term potentiation. A key feature of the EE effect was activation of beta2-adrenergic receptors and downstream cAMP/PKA signaling. This EE pathway prevented LTP inhibition by soluble oligomers of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) isolated from AD cortex. Protection by EE occurred in both young and middle-aged wild-type mice. Exposure to novelty afforded greater protection than did aerobic exercise. Mice chronically fed a beta-adrenergic agonist without EE were protected from hippocampal impairment by Abeta oligomers. Thus, EE enhances hippocampal synaptic plasticity by activating beta-adrenoceptor signaling and mitigating synaptotoxicity of human Abeta oligomers. These mechanistic insights support using prolonged exposure to cognitive novelty and/or oral beta-adrenergic agonists to lessen the effects of Abeta accumulation during aging.",

    "title": "Amyloid beta peptides modify the expression of antioxidant repair enzymes and a potassium channel in the septohippocampal system.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative brain disorder characterized by extracellular accumulations of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, intracellular accumulation of abnormal proteins, and early loss of basal forebrain neurons. Recent studies have indicated that the conformation of Abeta is crucial for neuronal toxicity, with intermediate misfolded forms such as oligomers being more toxic than the final fibrillar forms. Our previous work shows that Abeta blocks the potassium (K(+)) currents IM and IA in septal neurons, increasing firing rates, diminishing rhythmicity and firing coherence. Evidence also suggests that oxidative stress (OS) plays a role in AD pathogenesis. Thus we wished to determine the effect of oligomeric and fibrillar forms of Abeta1-42 on septohippocampal damage, oxidative damage, and dysfunction in AD. Oligomeric and fibrillar forms of Abeta1-42 were injected into the CA1 region of the hippocampus in live rats. The rats were sacrificed 24 hours and 1 month after Abeta or sham injection to additionally evaluate the temporal effects. The expression levels of the K(+) voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 2 (KCNQ2) and the OS-related genes superoxide dismutase 1, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase, and monamine oxidase A, were analyzed in the hippocampus, medial, and lateral septum. Our results show that both forms of Abeta exhibit time-dependent differential modulation of OS and K(+) channel genes in the analyzed regions. Importantly, we demonstrate that Abeta injected into the hippocampus triggered changes in gene expression in anatomical regions distant from the injection site. Thus the Abeta effect was transmitted to anatomically separate sites, because of the functional coupling of the brain structures.",

    "abstract": "While moderate calorie restriction (CR) in the absence of malnutrition has been consistently shown to have a systemic, beneficial effect against aging in several animals models, its effect on the brain microstructure in a non-human primate model remains to be studied using post-mortem histopathologic techniques. In the present study, we investigated differences in expression levels of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) and beta-amyloid plaque load in the hippocampus and the adjacent cortical areas of 7 Control (ad libitum)-fed and 6 CR male rhesus macaques using immunostaining methods. CR monkeys expressed significantly lower levels (~30% on average) of GFAP than Controls in the CA region of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, suggesting a protective effect of CR in limiting astrogliosis. These results recapitulate the neuroprotective effects of CR seen in shorter-lived animal models. There was a significant positive association between age and average amyloid plaque pathology in these animals, but there was no significant difference in amyloid plaque distribution between the two groups. Two of the seven Control animals (28.6%) and one of the six CR animal (16.7%) did not express any amyloid plaques, five of seven Controls (71.4%) and four of six CR animals (66.7%) expressed minimal to moderate amyloid pathology, and one of six CR animals (16.7%) expressed severe amyloid pathology. That CR affects levels of GFAP expression but not amyloid plaque load provides some insight into the means by which CR is beneficial at the microstructural level, potentially by offsetting the increased load of oxidatively damaged proteins, in this non-human primate model of aging. The present study is a preliminary post-mortem histological analysis of the effects of CR on brain health, and further studies using molecular and biochemical techniques are warranted to elucidate underlying mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Lowering the production and accumulation of Abeta has been explored as treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), because Abeta is postulated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. 5-HT4 receptors are an interesting drug target in this regard, as their activation might stimulate alpha-secretase processing, which increases sAPPalpha and reduces Abeta, at least according to the central dogma in APP processing. Here we describe a novel high-affinity 5-HT4 receptor agonist SSP-002392 that, in cultured human neuroblastoma cells, potently increases the levels of cAMP and sAPPalpha at 100-fold lower concentrations than the effective concentrations of prucalopride, a known selective 5-HT4 receptor agonist. Chronic administration of this compound in a hAPP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease decreased soluble and insoluble Abeta in hippocampus, but the potential mechanisms underlying these observations seem to be complex. We found no evidence for direct alpha-secretase stimulation in the brain in vivo, but observed decreased APP and BACE-1 expression and elevated astroglia and microglia responses. Taken together these results provide support for a potential disease-modifying aspect when stimulating central 5-HT4 receptors; however, the complexity of the phenomena warrants further research.",

    "abstract": "Education and cognitive occupations are commonly associated to reduce risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or dementia. Animal studies have demonstrated that cognitive stimulation (CS) achieved by social/physical activities and/or enriched environments compensates for memory decline. We have elaborated a novel paradigm of CS that is devoid of physical/social activity and enriched environments. 4 month-old Tg2576 mice were cognitively trained for 8 weeks and, after a break of 8 months, long-lasting effects of CS on cognitive abilities and AD-like pathology were measured. Morris Water Maze (MWM) and Novel Object Recognition (NOR) tests showed that deficits in spatial and recognition memories were compensated by CS. These outcomes were accompanied by increased levels of hippocampal post-synaptic markers (PSD95 and NR1) and proteins involved in synaptic formation (Arc, beta-catenin). CS softened amyloid pathology in terms of reduced levels of Abeta1-42 and the dodecameric assembly, referred as Abeta*56. CS appeared to affect the APP processing since differences in levels of ADAM17, BACE1 and C99/C83 ratio were found. Tau hyper-phosphorylation and high activities of tau kinases were also reduced by CS. In contrast, CS did not induce any of these molecular changes in wild-type mice. The present findings suggest beneficial and long-lasting effects of CS early in life on cognitive decline and AD-like pathology.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is known to exert cytotoxic effects by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), which is involved in the release of apoptotic proteins with possible relevance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial function and integrity. However, the application of therapeutic drugs, especially natural products in (AD) therapy via VDAC1-regulated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway has not aroused extensive attention. In the present study, we investigated neuroprotective effects of hesperidin, a bioactive flavonoid compound, on Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells and also examined the potential cellular signalling mechanism. Our results showed that treatment with hesperidin significantly inhibited Abeta25-35-induced apoptosis by reversing Abeta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, including the mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, intracellular free calcium increase and reactive oxygen species production. Further study indicated that hesperidin can decrease the level ofVDAC1 phosphorylation through inhibiting the activity of the glycogen synthase kinase-3b and increase the level of hexokinaseI in mitochondria, preventing release of cytochrome c from mitochondria [corrected]. Furthermore, hesperidin inhibited mitochondria-dependent downstream caspase-mediated apoptotic pathway, such as that involving caspase-9 and caspase-3. These results demonstrate that hesperidin can protect Abeta-induced neurotoxicity via VDAC1-regulated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and they raise the possibility that hesperidin could be developed into a clinically valuable treatment for AD and other neuronal degenerative diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.",

    "title": "Amyloid beta deposition, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline in sporadic Alzheimer's disease: a prospective cohort study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Similar to most chronic diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD) develops slowly from a preclinical phase into a fully expressed clinical syndrome. We aimed to use longitudinal data to calculate the rates of amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition, cerebral atrophy, and cognitive decline. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, healthy controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with AD were assessed at enrolment and every 18 months. At every visit, participants underwent neuropsychological examination, MRI, and a carbon-11-labelled Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PiB) PET scan. We included participants with three or more (11)C-PiB PET follow-up assessments. Abeta burden was expressed as (11)C-PiB standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR) with the cerebellar cortex as reference region. An SUVR of 1 5 was used to discriminate high from low Abeta burdens. The slope of the regression plots over 3-5 years was used to estimate rates of change for Abeta deposition, MRI volumetrics, and cognition. We included those participants with a positive rate of Abeta deposition to calculate the trajectory of each variable over time. FINDINGS: 200 participants (145 healthy controls, 36 participants with MCI, and 19 participants with AD) were assessed at enrolment and every 18 months for a mean follow-up of 3 8 (95% CI CI 3 6-3 9) years. At baseline, significantly higher Abeta burdens were noted in patients with AD (2 27, SD 0 43) and those with MCI (1 94, 0 64) than in healthy controls (1 38, 0 39). At follow-up, 163 (82%) of the 200 participants showed positive rates of Abeta accumulation. Abeta deposition was estimated to take 19 2 (95% CI 16 8-22 5) years in an almost linear fashion-with a mean increase of 0 043 (95% CI 0 037-0 049) SUVR per year-to go from the threshold of (11)C-PiB positivity (1 5 SUVR) to the levels observed in AD. It was estimated to take 12 0 (95% CI 10 1-14 9) years from the levels observed in healthy controls with low Abeta deposition (1 2 [SD 0 1] SUVR) to the threshold of (11)C-PiB positivity. As AD progressed, the rate of Abeta deposition slowed towards a plateau. Our projections suggest a prolonged preclinical phase of AD in which Abeta deposition reaches our threshold of positivity at 17 0 (95% CI 14 9-19 9) years, hippocampal atrophy at 4 2 (3 6-5 1) years, and memory impairment at 3 3 (2 5-4 5) years before the onset of dementia (clinical dementia rating score 1). INTERPRETATION: Abeta deposition is slow and protracted, likely to extend for more than two decades. Such predictions of the rate of preclinical changes and the onset of the clinical phase of AD will facilitate the design and timing of therapeutic interventions aimed at modifying the course of this illness.

    "abstract": "The transgenic TgCRND8 mouse is widely used as an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and exhibits an early onset of senile plaque pathogenesis in the brain. Here we report that TgCRND8 mice also have amyloid-beta (Abeta) neuropathology in spinal cord. TgCRND8 mice began to show obvious Abeta deposition in both gray matter of dorsal horn and white matter in the central part of dorsal column of the spinal cord at 10 months of age onward. Further experiments showed that the distribution of Abeta deposition in the spinal cord corresponds to the corticospinal tract pathway and its projection regions in TgCRND8 mice. We hypothesized that neurons in the sensorimotor cortex is the source of the Abeta peptide deposited in the spinal cord of these mice. To test the hypothesis, we ablated the sensorimotor cortex to interrupt connections between the sensorimotor cortex and spinal cord. We found that Abeta burden was significantly reduced in the denervated side compared to the contralateral side. Our results suggest that the sensorimotor cortex might be the primary source of Abeta in spinal cord of TgCRND8 mice. This is consistent with the observation that the sensorimotor cortex is one region particularly vulnerable during the progression of AD. The characteristics of Abeta distribution in TgCRND8 mice suggest that there are other ways related to the formation of Abeta plaques in addition to the terminal and synaptic release of Abeta.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD) is shifting from dementia to the prodromal stage of the disorder, to a large extent due to increasing efforts in trying to develop disease modifying treatment for the disorder. For development of disease-modifying drugs, a reliable and accurate test for identification of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD is essential. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, MCI progressing to AD will be predicted using blood-based gene expression. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gene expression analysis using qPCR was performed on blood RNA from a cohort of patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI; n = 66). Within the aMCI cohort, patients progressing to AD within 1 to 2 years were grouped as MCI converters (n = 34) and the patients remaining at the MCI stage after 2 years were grouped as stable MCI (n = 32). AD and control populations were also included in the study. RESULTS: Multivariate statistical method partial least square regression was used to develop predictive models which later were tested using leave-one-out cross validation. Gene expression signatures that identified aMCI subjects that progressed to AD within 2 years with a prediction accuracy of 74%-77% were identified for the complete dataset and subsets thereof. CONCLUSION: The present pilot study demonstrates for the first time that MCI that evolves into AD dementia within 2 years may be predicted by analyzing gene expression in blood. Further studies will be needed to validate this gene signature as a potential test for AD in the predementia stage.",

    "abstract": "Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is considered to be one of the early stages in the progression from no cognitive impairment (NCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals with aMCI have increased levels of AD-type neuropathology in multiple regions of the neocortex and hippocampus and demonstrate a loss of synaptic connectivity. Recent neuroimaging studies have reported increased levels of 11C-PiB (Pittsburgh, compound B) in regions of the neocortex including the precuneus region of the medial parietal lobe. This cortical region has been implicated in episodic memory, which is disrupted early in the progression of AD. In this study, unbiased stereology coupled with electron microscopy was used to quantify total synaptic numbers in lamina 3 of the precuneus from short postmortem autopsy tissue harvested from subjects who died at different cognitive stages during the progression of AD. Individuals with aMCI did not reveal a statistically significant decline in total synapses compared to the NCI cohort while the AD group did show a modest but significant decline. Synaptic numbers failed to correlate with several different cognitive tasks including the Mini-Mental State Examination scores and episodic memory scores. Although levels of [3H]PiB binding were elevated in both the aMCI and AD groups, it did not strongly correlate with synaptic counts. These results support the idea that despite increased amyloid load, the precuneus region does not show early changes in synaptic decline during the progression of AD.",

However, no data are available on the effects that 5LO has on synaptic function, integrity and cognition. To address this issue, we used a genetic and a pharmacological approach by generating 3 x Tg mice deficient for 5LO and administering 3 x Tg mice with a 5LO inhibitor. Compared with controls, we found that even before the development of overt neuropathology, both animals manifested significant memory improvement, rescue of their synaptic dysfunction and amelioration of synaptic integrity. In addition, later in life, these mice had a significant reduction of Abeta and tau pathology. Our findings support a novel functional role for 5LO in regulating synaptic plasticity and memory. They establish this protein as a pleiotropic contributor to the development of the full spectrum of the AD phenotype, making it a valid therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Sleep and circadian problems are very common in Alzheimer disease (AD). Recent animal studies suggest a bidirectional relationship between sleep and beta-amyloid (Abeta), a key molecule involved in AD pathogenesis. OBJECTIVE: To test whether Abeta deposition in preclinical AD, prior to the appearance of cognitive impairment, is associated with changes in quality or quantity of sleep. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study conducted from October 2010 to June 2012. SETTING: General community volunteers at the Washington University Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. PARTICIPANTS: Cognitively normal individuals (n = 145) 45 years and older were recruited from longitudinal studies of memory and aging at the Washington University Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. Valid actigraphy data were recorded in 142. The majority (124 of 142) were recruited from the Adult Children Study, in which all were aged 45 to 75 years at baseline and 50% have a parental history of late-onset AD. The rest were recruited from a community volunteer cohort in which all were older than 60 years and healthy at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sleep was objectively measured using actigraphy for 2 weeks. Sleep efficiency, which is the percentage of time in bed spent asleep, was the primary measure of sleep quality. Total sleep time was the primary measure of sleep quantity. Cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 levels were used to determine whether amyloid deposition was present or absent. Concurrent sleep diaries provided nap information. RESULTS: Amyloid deposition, as assessed by Abeta42 levels, was present in 32 participants (22.5%). This group had worse sleep quality, as measured by sleep efficiency (80.4% vs 83.7%), compared with those without amyloid deposition, after correction for age, sex, and APOEepsilon4 allele carrier status (P = .04). In contrast, quantity of sleep was not significantly different between groups, as measured by total sleep time. Frequent napping, 3 or more days per week, was associated with amyloid deposition (31.2% vs 14.7%; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Amyloid deposition in the preclinical stage of AD appears to be associated with worse sleep quality but not with changes in sleep quantity.",

    "title": "Correlation of specific amyloid-beta oligomers with tau in cerebrospinal fluid from cognitively normal older adults.",
    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: To improve the ability to develop treatments that prevent incipient Alzheimer disease (AD) from progressing to overt AD, it is important to understand the molecular basis of the earliest pathophysiological abnormalities and to determine how amyloid-beta (Abeta) is involved very early in its pathogenesis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate 2 specific Abeta oligomers, Abeta trimers and Abeta*56, in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); evaluate the effects of aging and AD; and obtain support for the hypothesis that they may be pathogenic by determining their relationships to CSF tau. DESIGN: A CSF sampling study. SETTINGS: The University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the Salhgrenska University Hospital, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight older adults with mild cognitive impairment or AD (impaired group); 49 age-matched cognitively intact control subjects (unimpaired group); and 10 younger, normal control subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements of CSF Abeta trimers, Abeta*56, the 42-amino acid Abeta isoform (Abeta1-42), total tau (T-tau), and phospho-tau 181 (p-tau(181)). The hypothesis being tested was formulated after data collection. RESULTS We observed that Abeta trimers and Abeta*56 levels increased with age; within the unimpaired group, they were elevated in subjects with T-tau/Abeta1-42 ratios greater than a cutoff that distinguished the unimpaired group from subjects with AD. In the unimpaired group, T-tau and p-tau(181) were found to correlate strongly with Abeta trimers and Abeta*56 (r > 0.63), but not with Abeta1-42 (-0.10 < r < -0.01). The strong correlations were found to be attenuated in the impaired group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In cognitively intact older adults, CSF Abeta trimers and Abeta*56 were elevated in individuals at risk for AD, and they showed stronger relationships with tau than did Abeta1-42, a surrogate for Abeta fibril deposition. These findings suggest that prior to overt symptoms, 1 or both of the Abeta oligomers, but not fibrillar Abeta, is coupled to tau; however, this coupling is weakened or broken when AD advances to symptomatic stages. The uncoupling is interesting in light of the failure of experimental Abeta therapies to improve mild cognitive impairment/AD, which has prompted a shift in the timing of Abeta therapies to asymptomatic subjects. Knowing which Abeta species to target in asymptomatic subjects may enhance the success of future treatments for AD.",

    "abstract": "Although the interaction between beta-amyloid (Abeta) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors has been widely studied, the impact of prolonged exposure to Abeta on nAChR expression and signaling is not known. In this study, we employed a neuronal culture model to better understand the impact of sustained exposure of Abeta on the regulation of cellular and synaptic function. The differentiated rodent neuroblastoma cell line NG108-15 expressing exogenous high-affinity alpha4beta2 nAChRs was exposed to soluble oligomeric Abeta for several days. Ca(2+) responses, expression levels of alpha4beta2 nAChRs, rate of mitochondrial movement, mitochondrial fission, levels of reactive oxygen species, and nuclear integrity were compared between Abeta-treated and untreated cells, transfected or not (mock-transfected) with alpha4beta2 nAChRs. Sustained exposure of Abeta(1-42) to alpha4beta2 nAChR-transfected cells for several days led to increased Ca(2+) responses on subsequent acute stimulation with Abeta(1-42) or nicotine, paralleled by increased expression levels of alpha4beta2 nAChRs, likely the result of enhanced receptor recycling. The rate of mitochondrial movement was sharply reduced, whereas the mitochondrial fission protein pDrp-1 was increased in alpha4beta2 nAChR-transfected cells treated with Abeta(1-42). In addition, the presence of alpha4beta2 nAChRs dramatically enhanced Abeta(1-42)-mediated increases in reactive oxygen species and nuclear fragmentation, eventually leading to apoptosis. Our data thus show disturbed calcium homeostasis coupled with mitochondrial dysfunction and loss of neuronal integrity on prolonged exposure of Abeta in cells transfected with alpha4beta2 nAChRs. Together, the results suggest that the presence of nAChRs sensitizes neurons to the toxic actions of soluble oligomeric Abeta, perhaps contributing to the cholinergic deficit in Alzheimer disease.",

Recently, we have identified low molecular weight AbetapE3 oligomers, which can be detected by 9D5, a novel mouse monoclonal antibody. In the present study, we analyzed the immunohistochemical staining profile in the brain of patients with AD and in the APP/PS1KI mouse model, as well as in aged rhesus monkeys. 9D5-positive microglia and blood vessels were found in many AD cases, in the transgenic mouse model, and in an aged macaque. The presence of 9D5-immunoreactivity in microglia indicates that low molecular weight AbetapE3 oligomers may be phagocytosed, since in the APP/PS1KI model, Abeta is exclusively produced in neurons due to neuronal expression of transgenic AbetaPP.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive reserve capacity may increase tolerance of neurodegenerative processes. However, its role regarding amyloid-beta (Abeta42) deposition in cognitively normal subjects is not well understood. We aimed to investigate the association between areas showing Abeta42-related structural changes and cognitive reserve proxies in cognitively intact subjects showing normal or abnormal Abeta42 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations. Thirty-three subjects (aged 55-85) underwent lumbar puncture and high resolution anatomical magnetic resonance imaging analyzed by voxel-based morphometry and cortical thickness procedures. Subjects with abnormal Abeta42 CSF levels showed significant left hippocampal atrophy and greater cortical thinning in parietal, temporal, and frontal regions (including the supramarginal and the anterior cingulate gyrus) compared to subjects with normal Abeta42 CSF levels. Using a multivariate general linear model, we investigated the relationship between these areas and cognitive reserve proxies. We found a significant relationship between decreased volume of the left hippocampus or decreased cortical thickness of the right supramarginal gyrus and higher cognitive reserve proxies only in the group with abnormal Abeta42 CSF levels. Thus, subjects with abnormal Abeta42 CSF levels (which may be at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease) and with high scores on cognitive reserve proxies may be tolerating a more advanced neurodegenerative process in critical cortical and subcortical regions. The present results emphasize the relevance of evaluating cognitive reserve proxies, as well as the importance of using neuroimaging techniques for early diagnosis in individuals with higher reserve.",

    "abstract": "The use of supplements with omega-3 (omega3) fatty acids (FAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is widespread due to proposed beneficial effects on the nervous and cardiovascular systems. Many effects of omega3 FAs are believed to be caused by down-regulation and resolution of inflammation. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with inflammation mediated by microglia and astrocytes, and omega3 FAs have been proposed as potential treatments for AD. The focus of the present study is on the effects of DHA and EPA on microglial phagocytosis of the AD pathogen amyloid-beta (Abeta), on secreted and cellular markers of immune activity, and on production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Human CHME3 microglial cells were exposed to DHA or EPA, with or without the presence of Abeta42. Phagocytosis of Abeta42 was analyzed by flow cytometry in conjunction with immunocytochemistry using antibodies to cellular proteins. Secreted proteins were analyzed by ELISA. Both DHA and EPA were found to stimulate microglial phagocytosis of Abeta42. Phagocytosis of Abeta42 was performed by microglia with a predominance of M2 markers. EPA increased the levels of BDNF in the culture medium. The levels of TNF-alpha were decreased by DHA. Both DHA and EPA decreased the pro-inflammatory M1 markers CD40 and CD86, and DHA had a stimulatory effect on the anti-inflammatory M2 marker CD206. DHA and EPA can be beneficial in AD by enhancing removal of Abeta42, increasing neurotrophin production, decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and by inducing a shift in phenotype away from pro-inflammatory M1 activation.",

    "abstract": "Although extensive evidence supports the role of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in Alzheimer disease (AD), the neurotoxic mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis are not understood. On the other hand, neuronal loss is the pathologic feature that best correlates with cognitive impairment. We hypothesized that cholinergic neurodegeneration may lead to Abeta deposition and tested this by inducing selective cholinergic lesions in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice with murine p75 saporin (mu p75-SAP). Intracerebroventricular lesions that removed approximately 50% of cholinergic innervation to the cortex and hippocampus were induced in animals with incipient (~3 months) and marked (~7 months of age) Abeta deposition. Cranial windows were implanted, and Abeta deposition was monitored in vivo using multiphoton microscopy. Deposition of Abeta was increased as soon as 7 days after the lesion, and this effect was maintained up to 3 months later. Postmortem studies using immunohistochemistry with an anti-Abeta antibody corroborated these findings in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Tau phosphorylation was also significantly increased after the lesions. Cholinergic denervation resulted in early memory impairment at 3 months of age that worsened with age (~7 months); there was a synergistic effect between cholinergic denervation and the presence of APP/PS1 transgenes. Altogether, our data suggest that cholinergic denervation may trigger Abeta deposition and synergistically contribute to cognitive impairment in AD patients.",

    "abstract": "FE65 proteins constitute a family of adaptors which modulates the processing of amyloid precursor protein and the consequent amyloid beta production. Thus, they have been involved in the complex and partially unknown cascade of reactions at the base of Alzheimer's disease etiology. However, FE65 and FE65-like proteins may be linked to neurodegeneration through the regulation of cell cycle in post-mitotic neurons. In this work we disclose novel molecular mechanisms by which APBB2 can modulate APP processing. We show that APBB2 mRNA splicing, driven by the over-expression of a novel non-coding RNA named 45A, allow the generation of alternative protein forms endowed with differential effects on Abeta production, cell cycle control, and DNA damage response. 45A overexpression also favors cell transformation and tumorigenesis leading to a marked increase of malignancy of neuroblastoma cells. Therefore, our results highlight a novel regulatory pathway of considerable interest linking APP processing with cell cycle regulation and DNA-surveillance systems, that may represent a molecular mechanism to induce neurodegeneration in post-mitotic neurons.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) in brain is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is generated after sequential cleavage of its parental molecule, amyloid precursor protein (APP), by beta- and gamma-secretases. Inhibition of gamma-secretase activity is an effective approach for the reduction of Abeta levels. Since gamma-secretase targets many different substrates, selective inhibition of its cleavage of APP is believed to be critical in order to avoid undesirable side effects. gamma-Secretase modulator (GSM) shifts the cleavage site on APP and production of amyloidogenic to non-amyloidogenic Abeta fragments. Since GSMs only modulate and do not block cleavage of gamma-secretase substrates, they are believed less likely to produce untoward adverse reactions. Here, we report in vivo Abeta-lowering profiles of a pyridazine and a pyridine-derived GSM: GSM-C (Wan et al., 2011a) and GSM-D (Wan et al., 2011b). Both compounds reduced Abeta40 and Abeta42 productions, increased shorter Abeta fragments, and had little effect on Notch signaling (~100-fold selective). They had excellent oral bioavailability (97.8% for GSM-C, ~100% for GSM-D) and good brain permeability (free brain to free blood AUC ratio of 0.41 and 1.10 for GSM-C and GSM-D, respectively). Oral administration of these compounds in both acute and sub-chronic conditions reduced Abeta levels in plasma and brain in rats in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Therefore, GSM-C and GSM-D represent two GSMs that are orally bioavailable and brain-permeable. They could serve as excellent tools in the investigation of the role of Abeta peptides in AD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The Alzheimer's disease (AD) process is understood to involve the accumulation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain. However, attempts at targeting the main culprits, neurotoxic Abeta peptides, have thus far proven unsuccessful for improving cognitive function. Recent clinical trials with passively administrated anti-Abeta antibodies failed to slow cognitive decline in mild to moderate AD patients, but suggest that an immunotherapeutic approach could be effective in patients with mild AD. Using an AD mouse model (Tg2576), we tested the immunogenicity (cellular and humoral immune responses) and efficacy (AD-like pathology) of clinical grade Lu AF20513 vaccine. We found that Lu AF20513 induces robust \"non-self\" T-cell responses and the production of anti-Abeta antibodies that reduce AD-like pathology in the brains of Tg2576 mice without inducing microglial activation and enhancing astrocytosis or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. A single immunization with Lu AF20513 induced strong humoral immunity in mice with preexisting memory T-helper cells. In addition, Lu AF20513 induced strong humoral responses in guinea pigs and monkeys. These data support the translation of Lu AF20513 to the clinical setting with the aims of: (1) inducing therapeutically potent anti-Abeta antibody responses in patients with mild AD, particularly if they have memory T-helper cells generated after immunizations with conventional tetanus toxoid vaccine, and (2) preventing pathological autoreactive T-cell responses.",

    "title": "Regulation of cardiac hypertrophic signaling by prolyl isomerase Pin1.",
    "abstract": "RATIONALE: Cardiac hypertrophy results from the complex interplay of differentially regulated cascades based on the phosphorylation status of involved signaling molecules. Although numerous critical regulatory kinases and phosphatases have been identified in the myocardium, the intracellular mechanism for temporal regulation of signaling duration and intensity remains obscure. In the nonmyocyte context, control of folding, activity, and stability of proteins is mediated by the prolyl isomerase Pin1, but the role of Pin1 in the heart is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To establish the role of Pin1 in the heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we show that either genetic deletion or cardiac overexpression of Pin1 blunts hypertrophic responses induced by transaortic constriction and consequent cardiac failure in vivo. Mechanistically, we find that Pin1 directly binds to Akt, mitogen activated protein kinase (MEK), and Raf-1 in cultured cardiomyocytes after hypertrophic stimulation. Furthermore, loss of Pin1 leads to diminished hypertrophic signaling of Akt and MEK, whereas overexpression of Pin1 increases Raf-1 phosphorylation on the autoinhibitory site Ser259, leading to reduced MEK activation. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data support a role for Pin1 as a central modulator of the intensity and duration of 2 major hypertrophic signaling pathways, thereby providing a novel target for regulation and control of cardiac hypertrophy.",

METHODS: Plasma amyloid beta (Abeta)1-40, Abeta1-42, Abetan-40, and Abetan-42 peptides were measured at baseline and after 18 months in 771 participants from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of aging. Abeta peptide levels were compared with clinical pathology, neuroimaging and neuropsychological measurements. RESULTS: Although inflammatory and renal function covariates influenced plasma Abeta levels significantly, a decrease in Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 was observed in patients with AD, and was also inversely correlated with neocortical amyloid burden. During the 18 months, plasma Abeta1-42 decreased in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in those transitioning from healthy to MCI. CONCLUSION: Our findings are consistent with a number of published plasma Abeta studies and, although the prognostic value of individual measures in any given subject is limited, the diagnostic contribution of plasma Abeta may demonstrate utility when combined with a panel of peripheral biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "The main objective of the present study was to establish whether the mixed sigma1/muscarinic ligand ANAVEX2-73, shown to be neuroprotective in Alzheimer's disease (AD) models in vivo and currently in clinical phase I/IIa, could have the ability to reduce the appearance of hyperphosphorylated Tau and amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42 in the Abeta25-35 mouse model of AD. We therefore first confirmed that Abeta25-35 injection induced hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein, by showing that it rapidly decreased Akt activity and activated glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) in the mouse hippocampus. Second, we showed that the kinase activation, and resulting Tau alteration, directly contributed to the amyloid toxicity, as co-administration of the selective GSK-3beta inhibitor 2-thio(3-iodobenzyl)-5-(1-pyridyl)-[1,3,4]-oxidiazole blocked both Tau phosphorylation and Abeta25-35-induced memory impairments. Third, we analyzed the ANAVEX2-73 effect on Tau phosphorylation and activation of the related kinase pathways (Akt and GSK-3beta). And fourth, we also addressed the impact of the drug on Abeta25-35-induced Abeta1-42 seeding and observed that the compound significantly blocked the increase in Abeta1-42 and C99 levels in the hippocampus, suggesting that it may alleviate amyloid load in AD models. The comparison with PRE-084, a selective and reference sigma1 receptor agonist, and xanomeline, a muscarinic ligand presenting similar profile as ANAVEX2-73 on M1 and M2 subtypes, confirmed that both muscarinic and sigma1 targets are involved in the ANAVEX2-73 effects. The drug, acting synergistically on both targets, but with moderate affinity, presents a promising pharmacological profile.",

    "abstract": "Interaction of p3 (Abeta(17-42)) peptides with cell membranes is crucial for the understanding of amyloid toxicity associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Such p3-membrane interactions are considered to induce the disruption of membrane permeability and integrity, but the exact mechanisms of how p3 aggregates, particularly small p3 oligomers, induce receptor-independent membrane disruption are not yet completely understood. Here, we investigate the adsorption, orientation, and surface interaction of the p3 pentamer with lipid bilayers composed of both pure zwitterionic POPC (palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine) and mixed anionic POPC-POPG (palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol) (3 : 1) lipids using explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MD simulation results show that the p3 pentamer has much stronger interactions with mixed POPC-POPG lipids than pure POPC lipids, consistent with experimental observation that Abeta adsorption and fibrillation are enhanced on anionic lipid bilayers. Although electrostatic interactions are main attractive forces to drive the p3 pentamer to adsorb on the bilayer surface, the adsorption of the p3 pentamer on the lipid bilayer with C-terminal beta-strands facing toward the bilayer surface is a net outcome of different competitions between p3 peptides-lipid bilayer and ions-p3-bilayer interactions. More importantly, Ca(2+) ions are found to form ionic bridges to associate negatively charged residues of p3 with anionic headgroups of the lipid bilayer, resulting in Abeta-Ca(2+)-PO4(-) complexes. Intensive Ca(2+) bound to the lipid bilayer and Ca(2+) ionic bridges may lead to Ca(2+) hemostasis responsible for neuronal dysfunction and death. This work provides insights into the mutual structure, dynamics, and interactions of both Abeta peptides and lipid bilayers at the atomic level, which expand our understanding of the complex behavior of amyloid-induced membrane disruption.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to ethanol during developmental stages leads to several types of neurological disorders. Apoptotic neurodegeneration due to ethanol exposure is a main feature in alcoholism. Exposure of developing animals to alcohol induces apoptotic neuronal death and causes fetal alcohol syndrome. In the present study, we observed the possible protective effect of pyruvate against ethanol-induced neurodegeneration. Exposure of developing mice to ethanol (2.5 g/kg) induces apoptotic neurodegeneration and widespread neuronal cell death in the cortex and thalamus. Co-treatment of pyruvate (500 mg/kg) protects neuronal cell against ethanol by the reduced expression of caspase-3 in these brain regions. Immunohistochemical analysis and TUNNEL at 24 h showed that apoptotic cell death induced by ethanol in the cortex and thalamus is reduced by pyruvate. Histomorphological analysis at 24 h with cresyl violet staining also proved that pyruvate reduced the number of neuronal cell loss in the cortex and thalamus. The results showed that ethanol increased the expression of caspase-3 and thus induced apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing mice cortex and thalamus, while co-treatment of pyruvate inhibits the induction of caspase-3 and reduced the cell death in these brain regions. These findings, therefore, showed that treatment of pyruvate inhibits ethanol-induced neuronal cell loss in the postnatal seven (P7) developing mice brain and may appear as a safe neuroprotectant for treating neurodegenerative disorders in newborns and infants.",

    "title": "Pathogenesis of cerebral microbleeds: In vivo imaging of amyloid and subcortical ischemic small vessel disease in 226 individuals with cognitive impairment.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are a neuroimaging marker of small vessel disease (SVD) with relevance for understanding disease mechanisms in cerebrovascular disease, cognitive impairment, and normal aging. It is hypothesized that lobar CMBs are due to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and deep CMBs are due to subcortical ischemic SVD. We tested this hypothesis using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of subcortical SVD and in vivo imaging of amyloid in patients with cognitive impairment. METHODS: We included 226 patients: 89 with Alzheimer disease-related cognitive impairment (ADCI) and 137 with subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (SVCI). All subjects underwent amyloid imaging with [(11) C] Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography, and MRI to detect CMBs and markers of subcortical SVD, including the volume of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and the number of lacunes. RESULTS: Parietal and occipital lobar CMBs counts were higher in PiB(+) ADCI with moderate WMH than PiB(+) ADCI with minimal WMH, whereas PiB(-) patients with SVCI (ie, \"pure\" SVCI) showed both lobar and deep CMBs. In multivariate analyses of the whole cohort, WMH volume and lacuna counts were positively associated with both lobar and deep CMBs, whereas amyloid burden (PiB) was only associated with lobar CMBs. There was an interaction between lacuna burden and PiB retention on lobar (but not deep) CMBs (p<0.001). INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that although deep CMBs are mainly linked to subcortical SVD, both subcortical SVD and amyloid-related pathologies (eg, CAA) contribute to the pathogenesis of lobar CMBs, at least in subjects with mixed lobar and deep CMBs. Furthermore, subcortical SVD and amyloid-related pathologies interact to increase the risk of lobar CMBs.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brain is a key event in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. Apolipoprotein (Apo) E is a lipid carrier protein secreted by astrocytes, which shows inherent affinity for Abeta and has been implicated in the receptor-mediated Abeta uptake by neurons. To characterize ApoE involvement in the intraneuronal Abeta accumulation and to investigate whether blocking the ApoE/Abeta interaction could reduce intraneuronal Abeta buildup, we used a noncontact neuronal-astrocytic co-culture system, where synthetic Abeta peptides were added into the media without or with cotreatment with Abeta12-28P, which is a nontoxic peptide antagonist of ApoE/Abeta binding. Compared with neurons cultured alone, intraneuronal Abeta content was significantly increased in neurons co-cultured with wild-type but not with ApoE knockout (KO) astrocytes. Neurons co-cultured with astrocytes also showed impaired intraneuronal degradation of Abeta, increased level of intraneuronal Abeta oligomers, and marked down-regulation of several synaptic proteins. Abeta12-28P treatment significantly reduced intraneuronal Abeta accumulation, including Abeta oligomer level, and inhibited loss of synaptic proteins. Furthermore, we showed significantly reduced intraneuronal Abeta accumulation in APPSW/PS1dE9/ApoE KO mice compared with APPSW/PS1dE9/ApoE targeted replacement mice that expressed various human ApoE isoforms. Data from our co-culture and in vivo experiments indicate an essential role of ApoE in the mechanism of intraneuronal Abeta accumulation and provide evidence that ApoE/Abeta binding antagonists can effectively prevent this process.",

    "title": "Calsyntenin-3 C-terminal fragment accumulates in dystrophic neurites surrounding abeta plaques in tg2576 mouse and Alzheimer disease brains: its neurotoxic role in mediating dystrophic neurite formation.",
    "abstract": "Dystrophic neurites surrounding beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques precede neuronal death in Alzheimer disease. These neuritic alterations may be one of the initial stages for synaptic loss and dysfunction. However, intracellular pathways that cause local disruption of neuronal processes by Abeta remain to be fully elucidated. The identification of Abeta-induced genes that mediate neuritic pathology would provide considerable insight into the mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease. Previously, we reported that selective up-regulation of calsyntenin-3 (Cst-3) by Abeta and accumulation of neurotoxic Cst-3 in dystrophic neurites surrounding Abeta plaques may lead to local disruption of these neurites. Like amyloid precursor protein, Cst-3 undergoes two-step proteolytic processing: the primary cleavage with alpha-secretase generates an N-terminal ectodomain and a C-terminal fragment (CTF). The CTF is subsequently cleaved into p3 peptide and an intracellular domain via gamma-secretase. It would be interesting to know whether accumulated Cst-3 in dystrophic neurites surrounding Abeta plaques is the full-length version or a CTF. Herein, we show that the CTF but not full-length Cst-3 accumulated in dystrophic neurites surrounding Abeta plaques in Tg2576 mouse and Alzheimer disease brains. In vitro experiments with Cst-3 fragments have revealed that only the CTF resulted in acceleration of neuronal death. These results indicate that accumulation of the neurotoxic CTF in neurites surrounding Abeta plaques may lead to local disruption of neuronal processes and development of dystrophic neurites.",

    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) self-assembles into toxic oligomers. Of the two predominant Abeta alloforms, Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42, the latter is particularly strongly linked to AD. N-terminally truncated and pyroglutamated Abeta peptides were recently shown to seed Abeta aggregation and contribute significantly to Abeta-mediated toxicity, yet their folding and assembly were not explored computationally. Discrete molecular dynamics approach previously captured in vitro-derived distinct Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 oligomer size distributions and predicted that the more toxic Abeta1-42 oligomers had more flexible and solvent-exposed N-termini than Abeta1-40 oligomers. Here, we examined oligomer formation of Abeta3-40, Abeta3-42, Abeta11-40, and Abeta11-42 by the discrete molecular dynamics approach. The four N-terminally truncated peptides showed increased oligomerization propensity relative to the full-length peptides, consistent with in vitro findings. Conformations formed by Abeta3-40/42 had significantly more flexible and solvent-exposed N-termini than Abeta1-40/42 conformations. In contrast, in Abeta11-40/42 conformations, the N-termini formed more contacts and were less accessible to the solvent. The compactness of the Abeta11-40/42 conformations was in part facilitated by Val12. Two single amino acid substitutions that reduced and abolished hydrophobicity at position 12, respectively, resulted in a proportionally increased structural variability. Our results suggest that Abeta11-40 and Abeta11-42 oligomers might be less toxic than Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 oligomers and offer a plausible explanation for the experimentally observed increased toxicity of Abeta3-40 and Abeta3-42 and their pyroglutamated forms.",

The pathological hallmark of AD is accumulation of misfolded amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau) proteins in the brain. Since AD etiology remains unclear, several hypotheses have emerged to elucidate its pathological pathways. The amyloid cascade hypothesis, a leading hypothesis for AD development, advocates Abeta as the principal culprit. Additionally, evidence suggests that tau may contribute to AD pathology. Abeta and tau have also been shown to impact each other's pathology either directly or indirectly. Furthermore, metal ion dyshomeostasis is associated with these misfolded proteins. Metal interactions with Abeta and tau/ptau also influence their aggregation properties and neurotoxicity. Herein, we present current understanding on the roles of Abeta, tau, and metal ions, placing equal emphasis on each of these proposed features, as well as their inter-relationships in AD pathogenesis.",

    "title": "Leptin and ghrelin prevent hippocampal dysfunction induced by Abeta oligomers.",
    "abstract": "It was recently established that the stomach-derived ghrelin and the adipokine leptin promote learning and memory through actions within the hippocampus. Changes in the peripheral or brain levels of these peptides were described in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and were shown to correlate with the severity of cognitive decline. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that leptin or ghrelin can ameliorate amyloid and tau pathologies as well as cognitive deficits. However, the exact role of these peptides in AD is far from being elucidated. To fill this gap, our working hypothesis was that leptin and ghrelin can exert a neuroprotective role in AD suppressing hippocampal dysfunction triggered by synapto- and neurotoxic amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaO). Using primary cultured hippocampal neurons, we demonstrated that both peptides reduce AbetaO-induced production of superoxide and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, improving cell survival, and inhibit cell death through a receptor-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, it was shown that in AbetaO-treated neurons both leptin and ghrelin prevent glycogen synthase kinase 3beta activation. Therefore, the evidence gathered in this study revealed that leptin and ghrelin can act as neuroprotective agents able to rescue hippocampal neurons from AbetaO toxicity, thus highlighting their potential therapeutic role in AD.",

In Alzheimer disease (AD), these cells may affect disease progression by modulating the buildup of beta-amyloid (Abeta) or releasing proinflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic substances. Discovering agents capable of increasing Abeta uptake by phagocytic cells is of potential therapeutic interest for AD. Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) is an endogenous lipid mediator with potent anti-inflammatory properties directly involved in inflammatory resolution, an active process essential for appropriate host responses, tissue protection, and the return to homeostasis. Herein, we demonstrate that aspirin-triggered LXA4 (15 mug/kg) s.c., twice a day, reduced NF-kappaB activation and levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as increased levels of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta. Such changes in the cerebral milieu resulted in recruitment of microglia in an alternative phenotype, as characterized by the up-regulation of YM1 and arginase-1 and the down-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression. Microglia in an alternative phenotype-positive cells demonstrated improved phagocytic function, promoting clearance of Abeta deposits and ultimately leading to reduction in synaptotoxicity and improvement in cognition. Our data indicate that activating LXA4 signaling may represent a novel therapeutic approach for AD.",

It also explores the roles and unique challenges of long-distance caregivers, as well as interventions that target those challenges. An estimated 5.2 million Americans have AD. Approximately 200,000 people younger than 65 years with AD comprise the younger onset AD population; 5 million comprise the older onset AD population. Throughout the coming decades, the baby boom generation is projected to add about 10 million to the total number of people in the United States with AD. Today, someone in America develops AD every 68 seconds. By 2050, one new case of AD is expected to develop every 33 seconds, or nearly a million new cases per year, and the total estimated prevalence is expected to be 13.8 million. AD is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in Americans age 65 years or older. Between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of deaths resulting from heart disease, stroke, and prostate cancer decreased 16%, 23%, and 8%, respectively, whereas the proportion resulting from AD increased 68%. The number of deaths from AD as determined by official death certificates (83,494 in 2010) likely underrepresents the number of AD-related deaths in the United States. A projected 450,000 older Americans with AD will die in 2013, and a large proportion will die as a result of complications of AD. In 2012, more than 15 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 17.5 billion hours of care to people with AD and other dementias, a contribution valued at more than $216 billion. Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 years and older with AD and other dementias are three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are 19 times as great. Total payments in 2013 for health care, long-term care, and hospice services for people age 65 years and older with dementia are expected to be $203 billion (not including the contributions of unpaid caregivers). An estimated 2.3 million caregivers of people with AD and other dementias live at least 1 hour away from the care recipient. These \"long-distance caregivers\" face unique challenges, including difficulty in assessing the care recipient's true health condition and needs, high rates of family disagreement regarding caregiving decisions, and high out-of-pocket expenses for costs related to caregiving. Out-of-pocket costs for long-distance caregivers are almost twice as high as for local caregivers.",

    "abstract": "The coexistence of neuronal mitochondrial pathology and synaptic dysfunction is an early pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cyclophilin D (CypD), an integral part of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), is involved in amyloid beta (Abeta)-instigated mitochondrial dysfunction. Blockade of CypD prevents Abeta-induced mitochondrial malfunction and the consequent cognitive impairments. Here, we showed the elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by antioxidants probucol or superoxide dismutase (SOD)/catalase blocks Abeta-mediated inactivation of protein kinase A (PKA)/cAMP regulatory-element-binding (CREB) signal transduction pathway and loss of synapse, suggesting the detrimental effects of oxidative stress on neuronal PKA/CREB activity. Notably, neurons lacking CypD significantly attenuate Abeta-induced ROS. Consequently, CypD-deficient neurons are resistant to Abeta-disrupted PKA/CREB signaling by increased PKA activity, phosphorylation of PKA catalytic subunit (PKA C), and CREB. In parallel, lack of CypD protects neurons from Abeta-induced loss of synapses and synaptic dysfunction. Furthermore, compared to the mAPP mice, CypD-deficient mAPP mice reveal less inactivation of PKA-CREB activity and increased synaptic density, attenuate abnormalities in dendritic spine maturation, and improve spontaneous synaptic activity. These findings provide new insights into a mechanism in the crosstalk between the CypD-dependent mitochondrial oxidative stress and signaling cascade, leading to synaptic injury, functioning through the PKA/CREB signal transduction pathway.",

Alterations in tissue structure caused by the presence of Abeta may cause localised changes that can be detected by quantitative T1 and T2 relaxation time measurements averaged over larger areas of tissue than that of individual plaques. We constructed depth profiles of the T1 and T2 relaxation times of the cerebral cortex with subjacent white matter and hippocampus in six 5xFAD transgenic and six control mice at 11 months of age. We registered these profiles with corresponding profiles of three immunohistochemical markers: beta-amyloid; neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN), a marker of neuronal cell load; and myelin basic protein (MBP), a marker of myelin load. We found lower T1 in the 5xFAD transgenic mice compared to wild type control mice at all depths, with maximum sensitivity for detection at specific layers. T1 negatively correlated with Abeta staining intensity in the 5xFAD mice which had no changes in NeuN and MBP staining compared to wild type mice. We postulate that these relaxation time changes are due to the presence of beta-amyloid in the transgenic mice. It may be clinically feasible to develop a similar layered analysis protocol as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease in humans.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) may differ from those with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in cognitive impairment profiles and clinical course. Postmortem studies also reported that EOAD has a greater pathologic burden than LOAD. We examined the effects of age at onset on the burden and distribution of amyloid plaques in patients with AD, using a statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and regions of interest (ROIs) analyses of the Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET. METHODS: We initially recruited 72 patients with AD who had completed the [11C] PiB-PET scan, but four patients were excluded due to familial AD or incomplete MRI data. Of the 68 patients, 61 were classified as PiB-positive (PiB+) and seven as PiB-negative (PiB-) using the measured global PiB uptake ratio values. Of the 61 patients with PiB+ AD, in order to maximize the effect of onset age, we excluded 20 patients in their 60 s. Thus among the remaining 41 patients, the amyloid deposition of only 17 patients with EOAD (age onset <60 years) and 24 patients with LOAD (onset age >=70 years) were compared. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the global mean PiB index between EOAD and LOAD patients, whereas SPM and ROIs analyses showed that those with EOAD retained higher levels of PiB in the bilateral basal ganglia, bilateral thalamus, left superior temporal cortex, and left cuneus compared to those with LOAD. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that EOAD patients differed from those with LOAD in the topography of amyloid deposition, which may partly account for the findings from previous studies that extrapyramidal symptoms and frontal dysfunction are more common in EOAD than in LOAD patients.",

    "abstract": "Neurogenesis in the adult brain is important for memory and learning, and the alterations in neural stem cells (NSCs) may be an important part of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway has been suggested to play an important role in neuronal cell survival and is highly involved in adult neurogenesis. Recently, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) was found to affect the PI3K pathway. We investigated whether CoQ10 could restore amyloid beta (Abeta)25-35 oligomer-inhibited proliferation of NSCs by focusing on the PI3K pathway. To evaluate the effects of CoQ10 on Abeta25-35 oligomer-inhibited proliferation of NSCs, NSCs were treated with several concentrations of CoQ10 and/or Abeta25-35 oligomers. BrdU labeling, Colony Formation Assays, and immunoreactivity of Ki-67, a marker of proliferative activity, showed that NSC proliferation decreased with Abeta25-35 oligomer treatment, but combined treatment with CoQ10 restored it. Western blotting showed that CoQ10 treatment increased the expression levels of p85alpha PI3K, phosphorylated Akt (Ser473), phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (Ser9), and heat shock transcription factor, which are proteins related to the PI3K pathway in Abeta25-35 oligomers-treated NSCs. To confirm a direct role for the PI3K pathway in CoQ10-induced restoration of proliferation of NSCs inhibited by Abeta25-35 oligomers, NSCs were pretreated with a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002; the effects of CoQ10 on the proliferation of NSCs inhibited by Abeta25-35 oligomers were almost completely blocked. Together, these results suggest that CoQ10 restores Abeta25-35 oligomer-inhibited proliferation of NSCs by activating the PI3K pathway.",

    "abstract": "The assembly and deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in brain is a key pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. Factors have been identified that can either promote or inhibit Abeta assembly in brain. We previously reported that myelin basic protein (MBP) is a potent inhibitor of Abeta fibrillar assembly [Hoos, M. D., et al. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 9952-9961; Hoos, M. D., et al. (2009) Biochemistry 48, 4720-4727]. Moreover, the region on MBP responsible for this activity was localized to the 64 N-terminal amino acids (MBP1-64) [Liao, M. C., et al. (2010) J. Biol. Chem. 285, 35590-35598]. In the study presented here, we sought to further define the site on MBP1-64 involved in this activity. Deletion mapping studies showed that the C-terminal region (residues 54-64) is required for the ability of MBP1-64 to bind Abeta and inhibit fibril assembly. Alanine scanning mutagenesis revealed that amino acids K54, R55, G56, and K59 within MBP1-64 are important for both Abeta binding and inhibition of fibril assembly as assessed by solid phase binding, thioflavin T binding and fluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy studies. Strong spectral shifts are observed by solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of specific N-terminal residues (E3, R5, D7, E11, and Q15) of Abeta42 upon the interaction with MBP1-64. Although the C-terminal region of MBP1-64 is required for interactions with Abeta, a synthetic MBP50-64 peptide was itself devoid of activity. These studies identify key residues in MBP and Abeta involved in their interactions and provide structural insight into how MBP regulates Abeta fibrillar assembly.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide is a key trigger in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In humans, amyloid deposition precedes the appearance of intracellular inclusion pathology formed by cytosolic proteins such as Tau, alpha-synuclein and TDP-43. These secondary pathologies have not been observed in mice that model Alzheimer-type amyloidosis by expressing mutant amyloid precursor protein, with or without mutant presenilin 1. The lack of secondary pathology in these models has made it difficult to establish how amyloid deposition initiates the cascade of events that leads to secondary intracellular pathology that characterizes human AD. In transgenic mice that model Alzheimer-type amyloidosis, we sought to determine whether there is evidence of altered cytosolic protein folding by assessing whether amyloid deposition causes normally soluble proteins to misfold. Using a method that involved detergent extraction and sedimentation coupled with proteomic approaches, we identified numerous cytosolic proteins that show specific losses in solubility as amyloid accumulates. The proteins identified included glycolytic enzymes and members of the 14-3-3 chaperone family. A substantial accumulation of lysine 48-linked polyubiquitin was also detected. Overall, the data demonstrate that the accumulation of amyloid by some manner causes the loss of solubility intracellular cytosolic proteins.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent age-dependent form of dementia, characterized by extracellular amyloid deposits comprising amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in the cerebral cortex. Increasing evidence has indicated that ganglioside GM1 (GM1) in lipid rafts plays a pivotal role in amyloid deposition of Abeta and the related cytotoxicity in AD. Despite recent efforts to characterize Abeta-lipid interactions, the effect of Abeta aggregation on dynamic properties and organization of lipid membranes is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the aggregation of Abeta on supported lipid bilayers containing raft components (i.e., cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and GM1) and its effects on the membrane properties. We showed that the lateral fluidity of membranes was significantly affected by membrane binding and subsequent aggregation of Abeta. Microscopic observations of the membrane surfaces demonstrated an enhancement in phase separation of lipids as a result of interactions between Abeta and GM1 during induced aggregation of Abeta. The uptake of GM1 into Abeta aggregates and the attendant membrane damage were also observed under a microscope when the membrane-anchored aggregates were formed. On the basis of these observations, we propose that Abeta aggregates formed in the presence of lipid membranes have a latent ability to trigger the uptake of raft components accompanied by phase separation of lipids.",

By limiting glutamate escape into the surrounding neuropil, GLT-1 preserves the spatial specificity of synaptic signaling. Here we show that the amyloid-beta peptide Abeta1-42 markedly prolongs the extracellular lifetime of synaptically released glutamate by reducing GLT-1 surface expression in mouse astrocytes and that this effect is prevented by the vitamin E derivative Trolox. These findings indicate that astrocytic glutamate transporter dysfunction may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and suggest possible mechanisms by which several current treatment strategies could protect against the disease.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a high prevalence (55%) of Abeta deposition in a cohort of individuals remaining dementia-free into their 9th and 10th decades is associated with cognitive decline prior to imaging. METHODS: A total of 194 participants (mean age 85.5 years, range 82-95) who completed the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study (GEMS) and remained dementia-free subsequently completed Pittsburgh compound B-PET imaging. We examined cross-sectional associations between Abeta status and performance on a broad neuropsychological test battery completed at GEMS entry 7-9 years prior to neuroimaging. We also longitudinally examined cognition over annual evaluations using linear mixed models. RESULTS: At GEMS screening (2000-2002), participants who were Abeta-positive in 2009 had lower performance on the Stroop test (p < 0.01) and Raven's Progressive Matrices (p = 0.05), with trend level difference for Block Design (p = 0.07). Longitudinal analyses showed significant slope differences for immediate and delayed recall of the Rey-Osterrieth figure, semantic fluency, and Trail-Making Test parts A and B, indicating greater performance decline prior to neuroimaging for Abeta-positive relative to Abeta-negative participants (ps < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Highly prevalent Abeta deposition in oldest-older adults is associated with cognitive decline in visual memory, semantic fluency, and psychomotor speed beginning 7-9 years prior to neuroimaging. Mean differences in nonmemory domains, primarily executive functions, between Abeta-status groups may be detectable 7-9 years before neuroimaging.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins such as Tau is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease and fronto-temporal dementias. To link Tau pathology to cognitive impairments and defects in synaptic plasticity, we created four inducible Tau transgenic mouse models with expression of pro- and anti-aggregant variants of either full-length human Tau (hTau40/DeltaK280 and hTau40/DeltaK280/PP) or the truncated Tau repeat domain (Tau(RD)/DeltaK280 and Tau(RD)/DeltaK280/PP). Here we review the histopathological features caused by pro-aggregant Tau, and correlate them with behavioral deficits and impairments in synaptic transmission. Both pro-aggregant Tau variants cause Alzheimer-like features, including synapse loss, mis-localization of Tau into the somatodendritic compartment, conformational changes and hyperphosphorylation. However, there is a clear difference in the extent of Tau aggregation and neurotoxicity. While pro-aggregant full-length hTau40/DeltaK280 leads to a 'pre-tangle' pathology, the repeat domain Tau(RD)/DeltaK280 causes massive formation of neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss in the hippocampus. However, both Tau variants cause co-aggregation of human and mouse Tau and similar functional impairments. Thus, earlier Tau pathological stages and not necessarily neurofibrillary tangles are critical for the development of cognitive malfunctions. Most importantly, memory and synapses recover after switching off expression of pro-aggregant Tau. The rescue of functional impairments correlates with the rescue of most Tau pathological changes and most strikingly the recovery of synapses. This implies that tauopathies as such are reversible, provided that amyloidogenic Tau is removed. Therefore, our Tau transgenic mice may serve as model systems for in vivo validation of therapeutic strategies and drug candidates with regard to cognition and synaptic function.",

    "abstract": "Processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases in neurons produces amyloid-beta (Abeta), whose excess accumulation leads to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Knowledge on subcellular trafficking pathways of APP and its fragments is important for the understanding of AD pathogenesis. We designed fusion proteins comprising a C-terminal fragment of APP (app) and fluorescent proteins GFP (G) and DsRed (D) to permit the tracking of the fusion proteins and fragments in cells. CAD cells expressing these proteins emitted colocalized green and red fluorescence and produce ectodomains, sGapp and sRapp, and Abeta, whose level was reduced by inhibitors of beta- and gamma-secretases. The presence of GappR in endosomes was observed via colocalization with Rab5. These observations indicated that the fusion proteins were membrane inserted, transported in vesicles and proteolytically processed by the same mechanism for APP. By attenuating fusion protein synthesis with cycloheximide, individual fluorescent colors from the C-terminus of the fusion proteins appeared in the cytosol which was strongly suppressed by beta-secretase inhibitor, suggesting that the ectodomains exit the cell rapidly (t1/2 about 20min) while the C-terminal fragments were retained longer in cells. In live cells, we observed the fluorescence of the ectodomains located between parental fusion proteins and plasma membrane, suggesting that these ectodomain positions are part of their secretion pathway. Our results indicate that the native ectodomain does not play a decisive role for the key features of APP trafficking and processing and the new fusion proteins may lead to novel insights in intracellular activities of APP.",

Amyloid fibers contain a repetitive spine, commonly built from a pair of beta-sheets whose beta-strands run perpendicular to the fiber direction and whose side chains interdigitate, much like the teeth of a zipper. In fiber spines known as homosteric zippers, identical protein segments sharing identical packing environments make the two beta-sheets. In previous work based on atomic resolution crystal structures of homosteric zippers derived from a dozen proteins, the symmetries of homosteric zippers were categorized into eight classes. Here, it is shown through a formal derivation that each homosteric zipper class corresponds to a unique set of symmetry groups termed `zipper groups'. Furthermore, the eight previously identified classes do not account for all of the 15 possible zipper groups, which may be categorized into the complete set of ten classes. Because of their foundations in group theory, the 15 zipper groups provide a mathematically rigorous classification for homosteric zippers.",

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are mainly produced by mitochondria which can cause oxidative stress. It has been considered that mitochondrial damage induced by oxidative stress is related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Besides, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is more vulnerable to oxidative damage than other biomacromolecules, causing serious dysfunction to mitochondria. beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) is a main factor responsible for the occurrence and development of AD. Astrocytes is an important target cell for Abeta' toxicity and can be activated to neglect their normal fountain in the central nervous system. Genistein (Gen), a main active ingredient of soybean isoflavone, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects by antagonizing oxidative damage induced by Abeta. Thus, in the present study, we evaluated Abeta25-35 induced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage and the protective effect of Gen in C6 glioma cells (C6 cells). The study design was consisted of four groups: control group (vehicle), Abeta group treated with Abeta25-35, Gen + Abeta group treated with Gen + Abeta25-35 and Gen group treated with Gen only. C6 cells were pre-incubated with or without Gen (50 muM) for 2 h followed by the incubation with Abeta25-35 (25 muM) for another 24 h. Then the cells were harvested and processed to perform the analysis according to protocols. The mitochondrial ROS in C6 cells were measured by fluorescence spectrometer. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the mitochondrial reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) in C6 cells, then the ratio of GSH and GSSG was calculated. The levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in C6 cells was also detected by ELISA. In addition, mtDNA deletion was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The mRNA and protein expression of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) in both C6 cells and its mitochondria, and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in mitochondria were detected by using reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot. The results showed that the increased mitochondrial ROS accumulation in C6 cells induced by Abeta was profoundly reversed by pre-treaded with Gen (p < 0.05). The ratio of GSH and GSSG in mitochondria was significantly increased in both Gen + Abeta group and Gen group compared with Abeta group (p < 0.05). The levels of 8-OHdG in C6 cells and mtDNA deletion were decreased after pre-treated with Gen (p < 0.05). Gen could also up-regulate the mRNA and protein expression of OGG1 in both C6 cells and its mitochondria and mitochondrial MnSOD compared with the Abeta group (p < 0.05). These results confirmed that Gen could alleviate the mitochondria-targeted oxidative damage induced by beta-amyloid 25-35 in C6 cells which might be useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "title": "Clinical utility and analytical challenges in measurement of cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta(1-42) and tau proteins as Alzheimer disease biomarkers.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Over the past 2 decades, clinical studies have provided evidence that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta(1-42) (Abeta(1-42)), total tau (t-tau), and tau phosphorylated at Thr181 (p-tau(181)) are reliable biochemical markers of Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology. CONTENT: In this review, we summarize the clinical performance and describe the major challenges for the analytical performance of the most widely used immunoassay platforms [based on ELISA or microbead-based multianalyte profiling (xMAP) technology] for the measurement of CSF AD biomarkers (Abeta(1-42), t-tau, and p-tau(181)). With foundational immunoassay data providing the diagnostic and prognostic values of CSF AD biomarkers, the newly revised criteria for the diagnosis of AD include CSF AD biomarkers for use in research settings. In addition, it has been suggested that the selection of AD patients at the predementia stage by use of CSF AD biomarkers can improve the statistical power of clinical trial design. Owing to the lack of a replenishable and commutable human CSF-based standardized reference material (SRM) and significant differences across different immunoassay platforms, the diagnostic-prognostic cutpoints of CSF AD biomarker concentrations are not universal at this time. These challenges can be effectively met in the future, however, through collaborative ongoing standardization efforts to minimize the sources of analytical variability and to develop reference methods and SRMs. SUMMARY: Measurements of CSF Abeta(1-42), t-tau, and p-tau(181) with analytically qualified immunoassays reliably reflect the neuropathologic hallmarks of AD in patients at the early predementia stage of the disease and even in presymptomatic patients. Thus these CSF biomarker tests are useful for early diagnosis of AD, prediction of disease progression, and efficient design of drug intervention clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have pointed to clusterin (apolipoprotein J) as being linked to the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease (AD); studies have identified the protein as a possible biomarker. The association between clusterin and senile plaques in AD brain is well known, and clusterin levels in AD brain are 40% higher than that in control subjects. The present study investigates, immunohistochemically, the association between clusterin and Abeta peptides in AD and control cortex. A unique and specific association between clusterin and Abeta40 was observed in plaques in the cerebral cortex from AD subjects in that only plaques that contained Abeta40 showed clusterin immunoreactivity, while the many plaques with Abeta42 alone lacked clusterin labeling. Cerebrovascular Abeta in AD brain generally lacked Abeta42 but was positively labeled by both the Abeta40 and the clusterin antibodies. In control subjects, however, Abeta40 was absent from plaques, although very occasional plaques were found to be labeled by both the Abeta42 and the clusterin antibodies. Overall, in AD, but not aged control brain, clusterin was associated specifically with the Abeta40 form of Abeta in the brain. The lack of clusterin in association with Abeta42 may be a significant feature in neuronal loss and neurodegeneration in the disease state.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Differences in the level of cognitive compromise between individuals following brain injury are thought to arise from underlying differences in cognitive reserve. The level of cognitive reserve attained by an individual is influenced by both genetic and life experience factors such as educational attainment and occupational history. The Tasmanian Healthy Brain Project (THBP) is a world-first prospective study examining the capacity of university-level education to enhance cognitive reserve in older adults and subsequently reduce age-related cognitive decline and risk for neurodegenerative disease. METHODS: Up to 1,000 adults aged 50-79 years at the time of entry into the study will be recruited to participate in the THBP. All participants will be healthy and free of significant medical, psychological, or psychiatric illness. Of the participant sample, 90% will undertake a minimum of 12 months part-time university-level study as an intervention. The remaining 10% will act as a control reference group. Participants will complete an annual comprehensive assessment of neuropsychological function, medical health, socialization, and personal well-being. Premorbid estimates of past cognitive, education, occupational, and physical function will be used to account for the mediating influence of prior life experience on outcomes. Potential contributing genetic factors will also be explored. RESULTS: Participant results will be assessed annually. Participants displaying evidence of dementia on the comprehensive neuropsychological assessment will be referred to an independent psycho-geriatrician for screening and diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The THBP commenced in 2011 and is expected to run for 10-20 years duration. To date, a total of 383 participants have been recruited into the THBP.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed relationships among white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology markers, and brain volume loss. Subjects included 197 controls, 331 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 146 individuals with AD with serial volumetric 1.5-T MRI. CSF Abeta1-42 (n = 351) and tau (n = 346) were measured. Brain volume change was quantified using the boundary shift integral (BSI). We assessed the association between baseline WMH volume and annualized BSI, adjusting for intracranial volume. We also performed multiple regression analyses in the CSF subset, assessing the relationships of WMH and Abeta1-42 and/or tau with BSI. WMH burden was positively associated with BSI in controls (p = 0.02) but not MCI or AD. In multivariable models, WMH (p = 0.003) and Abeta1-42 (p = 0.001) were independently associated with BSI in controls; in MCI Abeta1-42 (p < 0.001) and tau (p = 0.04) were associated with BSI. There was no evidence of independent effects of WMH or CSF measures on BSI in AD. These data support findings that vascular damage is associated with increased brain atrophy in the context of AD pathology in pre-dementia stages.",

We found that acute treatment of cultured rat hippocampal neurons with nanomolar concentrations of Abeta oligomers reduced the recycling pool and increased the resting pool of synaptic vesicles. Endocytosis of synaptic vesicles and the regeneration of fusion-competent vesicles were also severely impaired. Furthermore, the release probability of the readily-releasable pool (RRP) was increased, and recovery of the RRP was delayed. All these effects were prevented by antibody against Abeta. Moreover reduction of the pool size was prevented by inhibiting calpain or CDK5, while the defects in endocytosis were averted by overexpressing phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate-5-kinase type I-gamma, indicating that these two downstream pathways are involved in Abeta oligomers-induced presynaptic dysfunction.",

Our results showed that treatment with IMM-H004 markedly reduced the number of apoptotic cells after exposure to Abeta25-35 or Abeta1-42, determined by MTT, TUNEL staining and Flow cytometry. Further study indicated that IMM-H004 significantly inhibited Abeta-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis by reversing Abeta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, including MMP (mitochondrial membrane potential) decrease, reactive oxygen species production, and mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. IMM-H004 can regulate the interaction between Bax and Bcl-2, decreased levels of p53 and active caspase-3 protein induced by Abeta25-35. Furthermore, IMM-H004 also reduced translocation of AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) induced by Abeta25-35. These results demonstrated that IMM-H004 was capable of protecting neuronal cells from Abeta-induced degeneration through a mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway. The results of this study lend further credence to the notion that IMM-H004 is a 'multipotent therapeutic agrent' that reduces toxic levels of brain Abeta, and holds the potential to protect neuronal mitochondrial function in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, a late-onset neurodegenerative disease, is the deposition of neuritic amyloid plaques composed of aggregated forms of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta). Abeta forms a variety of nanoscale, toxic aggregate species ranging from small oligomers to fibrils. Abeta and many of its aggregate forms strongly interact with lipid membranes, which may represent an important step in several toxic mechanisms. Understanding the role that specific regions of Abeta play in regulating its aggregation and interaction with lipid membranes may provide insights into the fundamental interaction between Abeta and cellular surfaces. We investigated the interaction and aggregation of several Abeta fragments (Abeta1-11, Abeta1-28, Abeta10-26, Abeta12-24, Abeta16-22, Abeta22-35, and Abeta1-40) in the presence of supported model total brain lipid extract (TBLE) bilayers. These fragments represent a variety of chemically unique domains within Abeta, that is, the extracellular domain, the central hydrophobic core, and the transmembrane domain. Using scanning probe techniques, we elucidated aggregate morphologies for these different Abeta fragments in free solution and in the presence of TBLE bilayers. These fragments formed a variety of oligomeric and fibrillar aggregates under free solution conditions. Exposure to TBLE bilayers resulted in distinct aggregate morphologies compared to free solution and changes in bilayer stability dependent on the Abeta sequence. Abeta10-26, Abeta16-22, Abeta22-35, and Abeta1-40 aggregated into a variety of distinct fibrillar aggregates and disrupted the bilayer structure, resulting in altered mechanical properties of the bilayer. Abeta1-11, Abeta1-28, and Abeta12-24 had minimal interaction with lipid membranes, forming only sparse oligomers.",

However, the regulation of mitAbeta metabolism is unknown. One of the proteases involved in mitAbeta catabolism is the long insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) isoform (IDE-Met(1)). However, the mechanisms of its expression are unknown, and its presence in brain is uncertain. We detected IDE-Met(1) in brain and showed that its expression is regulated by the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway (PGC-1alpha/NRF-1). A strong positive correlation between PGC-1alpha or NRF-1 and long IDE isoform transcripts was found in non-demented brains. This correlation was weaker in Alzheimer disease. In vitro inhibition of IDE increased mitAbeta and impaired mitochondrial respiration. These changes were restored by inhibition of gamma-secretase or promotion of mitochondrial biogenesis. Our results suggest that IDE-Met(1) links the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway with mitAbeta levels and organelle functionality.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is widely considered to be the major toxic agent in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, a condition which afflicts approximately 36 million people worldwide. Despite a plethora of studies stretching back over two decades, identifying the toxic Abeta species has proved difficult. Debate has centred on the Abeta fibril and oligomer. Despite support from numerous experimental models, important questions linger regarding the role of the Abeta oligomer in particular. It is likely a huge array of oligomers, rather than a single species, which cause toxicity. Reappraisal of the role of the Abeta fibril points towards a dynamic relationship with the Abeta oligomer within an integrated system, as supported by evidence from microglia. However, some continue to doubt the pathological role of amyloid beta, instead proposing a protective role. If the field is to progress, all Abeta oligomers should be characterised, the nomenclature revised and a consistent experimental protocol defined. For this to occur, collaboration will be required between major research groups and innovative analytical tools developed. Such action must surely be taken if amyloid-based therapeutic endeavour is to progress.",

Among the positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers, fluorodeoxyglucose F 18 ((18)F-FDG) is the compound most widely used in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias. However, this compound shows a level of specificity and sensitivity for early Alzheimer's disease detection that is lower than that provided by high-affinity ligands for beta-amyloid (Abeta). Among the new widely available fluorine 18 ((18)F)-labeled Abeta ligands, florbetapir F 18 ((18))F-AV-45; Amyvid ) showed clear qualitative and quantitative correlations between in vivo PET imaging and postmortem histopathologic analysis of Abeta. Florbetapir F 18 stands out for its high Abeta affinity and its pharmacokinetic properties that allow 10-minute PET scan imaging within 90 minutes after administration (dose = 370 MBq). Importantly, no safety concerns for florbetapir F 18 were found in preclinical studies. In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Amyvid as a radiotracer helpful for excluding the presence of Abeta in the brain. It was then approved earlier this year by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).",

    "abstract": "The contribution of the autosomal dominant mutations to the etiology of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) is well characterized. However, the molecular mechanisms contributing to sporadic AD are less well understood. Increased ceramide levels have been evident in AD patients. We previously reported that increased ceramide levels, regulated by increased serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), directly mediate amyloid beta (Abeta) levels. Therefore, we inhibited SPT in an AD mouse model (TgCRND8) through subcutaneous administration of L-cylcoserine. The cortical Abeta42 and hyperphosphorylated tau levels were down-regulated with the inhibition of SPT/ceramide. Positive correlations were observed among cortical SPT, ceramide, and Abeta42 levels. With no evident toxic effects observed, inhibition of SPT could be a safe therapeutic strategy to ameliorate the AD pathology. We previously observed that miR-137, -181c, -9, and 29a/b post-transcriptionally regulate SPT levels, and the corresponding miRNA levels in the blood sera are potential diagnostic biomarkers for AD. Here, we observe a negative correlation between cortical Abeta42 and sera Abeta42, and a positive correlation between cortical miRNA levels and sera miRNA levels suggesting their potential as noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers.",

The amyloidogenic aggregates were long thought to be toxic, but mounting evidence supports the notion that a variety of amyloid aggregate intermediates to fibril formation, termed oligomers, may in fact be the primary culprit leading to neuronal dysfunction and cell death. While amyloid formation is a complex, heterogeneous process, aggregates formed by diverse, diseases-related proteins share many conformational similarities, suggesting common toxic mechanisms among these diseases. Ideally, similar therapeutic strategies may be applicable.

METHODS: We measured biomarker levels in Young and Aged cynomolgus monkeys and correlated these with performance on three delayed response tasks. RESULTS: The Abeta42 concentration of the Aged monkeys was significantly lower than in the Young subjects, while the t-tau and p-tau did not significantly differ between the groups. The Young subjects performed significantly better than the Aged individuals on the memory tests. Only Abeta42 levels were significantly correlated with performance in the three delayed response tasks. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating Abeta42 levels were lower in Aged monkeys and were correlated with inferior performance on delayed response tasks in Aged animals; therefore, both measures may be useful in establishing cynomolgus monkeys as models for studies of AD.",

    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), fatal neuronal cell loss occurs long before relevant evidence can lead to a reliable diagnosis. If characteristic pathological alterations take place in the enteric nervous system (ENS), it could be one of the most promising targets for an early diagnosis, using submucosal biopsies from the gut. We therefore investigated time- and spatial-dependent changes in an amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) overexpressing transgenic mouse model to examine early changes within the ENS. Wholemount preparations and paraffin sections were analyzed for the expression of neuronal, glial, and innate immunity markers. Isolated myenteric networks were screened for differences in overall protein expression, and a motility analysis delivered functional data. The level of AbetaPP in the gut was significantly higher in the AD mouse model than in wild-type mice and also higher in the gut than in the brain at all ages investigated. The transcriptional level of Nestin, GFAP, and TLR4 increased with age with a peak at 3 months. At the protein level, human amyloid-beta was located in myenteric neurons. Myenteric networks showed a reduction of the neuronal density in AbetaPP compared to wild-type mice, which was functionally relevant as revealed by motility analysis. The ENS undergoes significant changes during the early onset of AbetaPP expression in AD mouse models that appear before those seen in the brain as demonstrated in this study. Thus, there is a chance of determining similar alterations in the human gut of AD patients, which could be used to develop early diagnostic approaches.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) binds several proteins determining metabolism, processing, and the physiological fate of the former. Among these is Fe65, a protein with specific functional significance for AbetaPP, in particular conferring stability when the latter is dephosphorylated on Thr668. Thus, it follows that phosphatases like protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) are relevant to AbetaPP processing. Consequently, the identification of AbetaPP binding proteins, which can be modulated directly or indirectly by PP1, take on added relevance in terms of biological significance. Using the yeast tri-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we describe a novel tri-complex comprising AbetaPP, Fe65 and PP1. We show that the trimeric complex (AbetaPP:Fe65:PP1gamma) occurs in COS-7 cells, rat hippocampal and cortical primary neurons, and in adult rat hippocampus and cortex. Using overlay assays, we demonstrate that Fe65 is in fact the bridging protein in the complex formed and thus we simultaneously describe another PP1 binding protein. This is singularly important given that PP1 binding proteins determine and confer subcellular localization, as well as substrate specificity, thus regulating the phosphatase activity and subsequent intracellular events. Additionally, we show that this interaction correlates with AbetaPP Thr668 phosphorylation state, consistent with the role of protein (de)phosphorylation as a key mechanism in regulating cellular events.",

    "abstract": "We recently generated an advanced mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by targeted knock-in of single-copy mutated human amyloid precursor-protein (APP) and tau genes, crossed with a non-symptomatic presenilin (PS1A246E) over-expressing mouse line. These PLB1Triple mice presented with age-dependent and AD-relevant phenotypes. Homozygous PLB1Triple mice aged 4-12 months were assessed here in a battery of spatial learning tasks: Exp.1 radial-arm water maze (spatial reference and working memory) Exp.2 open-field water maze (spatial reference memory); Exp.3 home cage observation system with spatial learning (IntelliCage); Exp.4 spontaneous object recognition (SOR; novel object and spatial object shift). A separate test with high-expression transgenic APP mice matching the design of experiment 1 was also performed. Spatial deficits in PLB1Triple mice were confirmed at 12, but not 4 months in both water maze tasks. PSAPP mice, by contrast, presented with severe yet non-progressive spatial learning deficits already at 4 months. During tests of spatial learning in SOR and IntelliCage, PLB1Triple mice neither acquired the location of the water-rewarded corner, nor recognize novel or spatially shifted objects at 4 months, indicating these protocols to be more sensitive than the water maze. Collectively and in line with AD symptomatology, PLB1Triple mice present with a graded and progressive age-dependent loss of spatial memory that can be revealed by the use of a battery of tasks. With the emergence of subtle deficits progressively increasing in severity, PLB1Triple mice may offer a more patho-physiologically relevant model of dementia than aggressive expression models.",

This study examined relationships between AD biomarkers of Abeta and neurodegeneration as well as cognitive performance in cognitively normal older individuals. Abeta burden was quantified in 72 normal older human subjects from the Berkeley Aging Cohort (BAC) using [(11)C] Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography. In the same individuals, we measured hippocampal volume, as well as glucose metabolism and cortical thickness, which were extracted from a template of cortical AD-affected regions. The three functional and structural biomarkers were merged into a highly AD-sensitive multimodality biomarker reflecting neural integrity. In the normal older individuals, there was no association between elevated PIB uptake and either the single-modality or the multimodality neurodegenerative biomarkers. Lower neural integrity within the AD-affected regions and a control area (the visual cortex) was related to lower scores on memory and executive function tests; the same association was not found with PIB retention. The relationship between cognition and the multimodality AD biomarker was stronger in individuals with the highest PIB uptake. The findings indicate that neurodegeneration occurs within AD regions regardless of Abeta deposition and accounts for worse cognition in cognitively normal older people. The impact of neural integrity on cognitive functions is, however, enhanced in the presence of high Abeta burden for brain regions that are most affected in AD.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We examined agreement and disagreement between 2 biomarkers of beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition (amyloid positron emission tomography [PET] and cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] Abeta1-42 ) in normal aging and dementia in a large multicenter study. METHODS: Concurrently acquired florbetapir PET and CSF Abeta were measured in cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease participants (n = 374) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We also compared Abeta measurements in a separate group with serial CSF measurements over 3.1 +- 0.8 years that preceded a single florbetapir session. Additional biomarker and cognitive data allowed us to further examine profiles of discordant cases. RESULTS: Florbetapir and CSF Abeta were inversely correlated across all diagnostic groups, and dichotomous measurements were in agreement in 86% of subjects. Among subjects showing the most disagreement, the 2 discordant groups had different profiles: the florbetapir(+) /CSF Abeta(-) group was larger (n = 13) and was made up of only normal and early MCI subjects, whereas the florbetapir(-) /CSF Abeta(+) group was smaller (n = 7) and had poorer cognitive function and higher CSF tau, but no ApoE4 carriers. In the longitudinal sample, we observed both stable longitudinal CSF Abeta trajectories and those actively transitioning from normal to abnormal, but the final CSF Abeta measurements were in good agreement with florbetapir cortical retention. INTERPRETATION: CSF and amyloid PET measurements of Abeta were consistent in the majority of subjects in the cross-sectional and longitudinal populations. Based on our analysis of discordant subjects, the available evidence did not show that CSF Abeta regularly becomes abnormal prior to fibrillar Abeta accumulation early in the course of disease.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence supports that amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers are the major causative agents leading to neural cell death in Alzheimer's disease. The polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was recently reported to inhibit Abeta fibrillization and redirect Abeta aggregation into unstructured, off-pathway oligomers. Given the experimental challenge to characterize the structures of Abeta/EGCG complexes, we performed extensive atomistic replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations of Abeta1-42 dimer in the present and absence of EGCG in explicit solvent. Our equilibrium Abeta dimeric structures free of EGCG are consistent with the collision cross section from ion-mobility mass spectrometry and the secondary structure composition from circular dichroism experiment. In the presence of EGCG, the Abeta structures are characterized by increased inter-center-of-mass distances, reduced interchain and intrachain contacts, reduced beta-sheet content, and increased coil and alpha-helix contents. Analysis of the free energy surfaces reveals that the Abeta dimer with EGCG adopts new conformations, affecting therefore its propensity to adopt fibril-prone states. Overall, this study provides, for the first time, insights on the equilibrium structures of Abeta1-42 dimer in explicit aqueous solution and an atomic picture of the EGCG-mediated conformational change on Abeta dimer.",

Abeta is produced by the sequential cleavage of APP by BACE1 and gamma-secretase; therefore, inhibition of BACE1 represents an attractive therapeutic target to slow or prevent Alzheimer's disease. Herein we describe BACE1 inhibitors with limited molecular flexibility and molecular weight that decrease CSF Abeta in vivo, despite efflux. Starting with spirocycle 1a, we explore structure-activity relationships of core changes, P3 moieties, and Asp binding functional groups in order to optimize BACE1 affinity, cathepsin D selectivity, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Using wild type guinea pig and rat, we demonstrate a PK/PD relationship between free drug concentrations in the brain and CSF Abeta lowering. Optimization of brain exposure led to the discovery of (R)-50 which reduced CSF Abeta in rodents and in monkey.",

The family of 2-substituted 8HQs has been proposed for use in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most notably, the therapeutic PBT2 (Prana Biotechnology Ltd.) has been shown to act as an efficient metal chaperone, disaggregate metal-enriched amyloid plaques comprised of the Abeta peptide, inhibit Cu/Abeta redox chemistry, and reverse the AD phenotype in transgenic animal models. Yet surprisingly little is known about the molecular interactions at play. In this study, we show that the homologous ligand 2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-8-hydroxyquinoline (HL) forms a CuL complex with a conditional (apparent) dissociation constant of 0.33 nM at pH 6.9 and is capable of forming ternary Cu(2+) complexes with neurotransmitters including histamine (HA), glutamic acid (Glu), and glycine (Gly), with glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and with histidine (His) side chains of proteins and peptides including the Abeta peptide. Our findings suggest a molecular basis for the strong metal chaperone activity of PBT2, its ability to attenuate Cu(2+)/Abeta interactions, and its potential to promote neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the major neurological diseases of the elderly. The deposition of Abeta peptide, which can induce neuronal oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis, plays important roles in neuronal degeneration in AD. Currently, there are no effective drug treatment options for preventing or even slowing Alzheimer's disease. Bilobalide (BB) is one of the major active compounds extracted from Ginkgo biloba leaves. This study explored the neuroprotective effects of BB on Abeta25-35 intrahippocampal injection induced AD model in rats. Our results showed that BB (4, 8 mg/kg) significantly protected against learning and memory impairments induced by Abeta25-35 in Morris water maze. Besides, BB (4, 8 mg/kg) was able to attenuate the neuronal damage and apoptosis in frontal cortex and hippocampus CA1 in rats. In addition, the inhibition of TNF-alpha and Abeta1-40 expression is also involved in the action mechanisms of BB in this experimental model. This study provided an experimental basis for the clinical application of BB in AD therapy.",

    "title": "Detection of beta-amyloid oligomers as a predictor of neurological outcome after brain injury.",
    "abstract": "OBJECT: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is known to be a risk factor for Alzheimer-like dementia. In previous studies, an increase in beta-amyloid (Abeta) monomers, such as beta-amyloid 42 (Abeta42), in the CSF of patients with TBI has been shown to correlate with a decrease in amyloid plaques in the brain and improved neurological outcomes. In this study, the authors hypothesized that the levels of toxic high-molecular-weight beta-amyloid oligomers are increased in the brain and are detectable within the CSF of TBI patients with poor neurological outcomes. METHODS: Samples of CSF were collected from 18 patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale Scores 3-8) and a ventriculostomy. In all cases the CSF was collected within 72 hours of injury. The CSF levels of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and Abeta42 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The levels of high-molecular-weight beta-amyloid oligomers were measured using Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Patients with good outcomes showed an increase in the levels of CSF Abeta42 (p = 0.003). Those with bad outcomes exhibited an increase in CSF levels of beta-amyloid oligomers (p = 0.009) and NSE (p = 0.001). In addition, the CSF oligomer levels correlated with the scores on the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (r = -0.89, p = 0.0001), disability rating scale scores (r = 0.77, p = 0.005), CSF Abeta42 levels (r = -0.42, p = 0.12), and CSF NSE levels (r = 0.70, p = 0.004). Additionally, the receiver operating characteristic curve yielded an area under the curve for beta-amyloid oligomers of 0.8750 +- 0.09. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of beta-amyloid oligomers may someday become a useful clinical tool for determining injury severity and neurological outcomes in patients with TBI.",

    "abstract": "Pathological cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) alterations like changes in amyloid-beta1-42 and tau protein concentration are typical in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains unclear, if the composition of known or unknown pathological factors in native CSF has a functional significance in AD. In this pilot study, we used multielectrode array (MEA) neurochips to determine whether CSF of individuals with AD (AD-CSF) may have distinct neurofunctional properties that may distinguish it from that of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) - a differential diagnosis of high clinical importance. MEAs are neuronal cultures coupled to a multisite electrical recording system with the ability to reflect pharmacological or toxicological alterations on the functional level of whole neuronal networks. Collective rhythmical electrical activity was substantially enhanced after exposure to CSF of cognitively healthy subjects (controls) and of MCI individuals (MCI-CSF) alike. However, this activity increment was significantly reduced when MEAs were exposed to AD-CSF compared to MCI-CSF. Moreover, following AD-CSF exposure, networks showed significantly enhanced burst durations and less synchronous bursting, respectively. Thus, AD-CSF and MCI-CSF could be distinguished by characteristic changes of the network firing pattern on MEAs. When data of MCI individuals and AD patients were pooled, the network suppression correlated significantly with the degree of cognitive decline. The findings of this pilot study may set the stage for a unique and straightforward diagnostic bioassay of AD with particular value in the differential diagnosis to MCI and as a much needed biomarker for clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cerebral accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by alpha- or beta-secretase results in two soluble metabolites, sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta, respectively. However, previous data have shown that both alpha- and beta-secretase have multiple cleavage sites. The aim of this study was to characterize the C-termini of sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by mass spectrometry (MS) and to evaluate whether different combinations of these fragments better separate between AD patients and controls by comparing two different sAPP immunoassays. METHODS: Using immunoprecipitation and high resolution MS, the APP species present in CSF were investigated. CSF levels of sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta from patients with AD (n=43) and from non-demented controls (n=44) were measured using AlphaLISA and MSD immunoassays that employ different antibodies for C-terminal recognition of sAPPalpha. RESULTS: Four different C-terminal forms of sAPP were identified, sAPPbeta-M671, sAPPbeta-Y681, sAPPalpha-Q686, and sAPPalpha-K687 (APP770 numbering). Neither immunoassay for the sAPP species could separate the two patient groups. The correlation (R(2)) between the two immunoassays was 0.41 for sAPPalpha and 0.45 for sAPPbeta. CONCLUSION: Using high resolution MS, we show here for the first time that sAPPalpha in CSF ends at Q686 and K687. The findings also support the conclusion from several previous studies that sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta levels are unaltered in AD.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We conducted a meta-analysis of relationships between amyloid burden and cognition in cognitively normal, older adult humans. METHODS: Methods of assessing amyloid burden included were CSF or plasma assays, histopathology, and PET ligands. Cognitive domains examined were episodic memory, executive function, working memory, processing speed, visuospatial function, semantic memory, and global cognition. Sixty-four studies representing 7,140 subjects met selection criteria, with 3,495 subjects from 34 studies representing independent cohorts. Weighted effect sizes were obtained for each study. Primary analyses were conducted limiting to independent cohort studies using only the most common assessment method (Pittsburgh compound B). Exploratory analyses included all assessment methods. RESULTS: Episodic memory (r = 0.12) had a significant relationship to amyloid burden. Executive function and global cognition did not have significant relationships to amyloid in the primary analysis of Pittsburgh compound B (r = 0.05 and r = 0.08, respectively), but did when including all assessment methods (r = 0.08 and r = 0.09, respectively). The domains of working memory, processing speed, visuospatial function, and semantic memory did not have significant relationships to amyloid. Differences in the method of amyloid assessment, study design (longitudinal vs cross-sectional), or inclusion of control variables (age, etc.) had little influence. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this meta-analytic survey of the literature, increased amyloid burden has small but nontrivial associations with specific domains of cognitive performance in individuals who are currently cognitively normal. These associations may be useful for identifying preclinical Alzheimer disease or developing clinical outcome measures.",

    "title": "Monetary costs of dementia in the United States.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dementia affects a large and growing number of older adults in the United States. The monetary costs attributable to dementia are likely to be similarly large and to continue to increase. METHODS: In a subsample (856 persons) of the population in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative longitudinal study of older adults, the diagnosis of dementia was determined with the use of a detailed in-home cognitive assessment that was 3 to 4 hours in duration and a review by an expert panel. We then imputed cognitive status to the full HRS sample (10,903 persons, 31,936 person-years) on the basis of measures of cognitive and functional status available for all HRS respondents, thereby identifying persons in the larger sample with a high probability of dementia. The market costs associated with care for persons with dementia were determined on the basis of self-reported out-of-pocket spending and the utilization of nursing home care; Medicare claims data were used to identify costs paid by Medicare. Hours of informal (unpaid) care were valued either as the cost of equivalent formal (paid) care or as the estimated wages forgone by informal caregivers. RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of dementia among persons older than 70 years of age in the United States in 2010 was 14.7%. The yearly monetary cost per person that was attributable to dementia was either $56,290 (95% confidence interval [CI], $42,746 to $69,834) or $41,689 (95% CI, $31,017 to $52,362), depending on the method used to value informal care. These individual costs suggest that the total monetary cost of dementia in 2010 was between $157 billion and $215 billion. Medicare paid approximately $11 billion of this cost. CONCLUSIONS: Dementia represents a substantial financial burden on society, one that is similar to the financial burden of heart disease and cancer. (Funded by the National Institute on Aging.).",

Our previous work established that amyloidogenic peptides from the small heat shock protein alphaB crystallin (HspB5) and from amyloid beta fibrils, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, were therapeutic in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), reflecting aspects of the pathology of MS. To understand the molecular basis for the therapeutic effect, we showed a set of amyloidogenic peptides composed of six amino acids, including those from tau, amyloid beta A4, major prion protein (PrP), HspB5, amylin, serum amyloid P, and insulin B chain, to be anti-inflammatory and capable of reducing serological levels of interleukin-6 and attenuating paralysis in EAE. The chaperone function of the fibrils correlates with the therapeutic outcome. Fibrils composed of tau 623-628 precipitated 49 plasma proteins, including apolipoprotein B-100, clusterin, transthyretin, and complement C3, supporting the hypothesis that the fibrils are active biological agents.

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Identifying risk factors for increased beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition is important for targeting individuals most at risk for developing Alzheimer disease and informing clinical practice concerning prevention and early detection. OBJECTIVE: To investigate risk factors for Abeta deposition in cognitively healthy middle-aged and older adults. Specifically, we hypothesized that individuals with a vascular risk factor such as hypertension, in combination with a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease (apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele), would show greater amyloid burden than those without such risk. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eighteen well-screened and cognitively normal adults, aged 47 to 89 years. Participants were classified in the hypertension group if they reported a medical diagnosis of hypertension or if blood pressure exceeded 140 mm Hg systolic/90 mm Hg diastolic, as measured across 7 occasions at the time of study. INTERVENTION: Participants underwent Abeta positron emission tomography imaging with radiotracer fluorine 18-labeled florbetapir. Participants were genotyped for apolipoprotein E and were classified as epsilon4(+) or epsilon4(-). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Amyloid burden. RESULTS: Participants in the hypertension group with at least 1 epsilon4 allele showed significantly greater amyloid burden than those with only 1 risk factor or no risk factors. Furthermore, increased pulse pressure was strongly associated with increased mean cortical amyloid level for subjects with at least 1 epsilon4 allele. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vascular disease is a prevalent age-related condition that is highly responsive to both behavioral modification and medical treatment. Proper control and prevention of risk factors such as hypertension earlier in the life span may be one potential mechanism to ameliorate or delay neuropathological brain changes with aging.",

In this study, the effects of PEBT on cognitive impairment induced by Abeta25-35 were assessed by Morris water maze and step-down inhibitory avoidance tasks. Mice received a single intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta25-35 (3 nmol/3 mul/per site) and a daily oral administration of PEBT (1 mg/kg, for 10 days). PEBT significantly improved Abeta-induced learning deficits on the training session in the Morris water maze. At the probe trial session, PEBT significantly decreased the escape latency and increased the number of crossings in the platform local compared with the Abeta-treated group. PEBT significantly improved Abeta-induced memory impairment in the step-down inhibitory avoidance task. General locomotor activity was similar in all groups. This study showed that PEBT ameliorated the impairments of spatial and nonspatial long-term memory evaluated on Morris water maze and step-down inhibitory avoidance tasks, respectively. The results suggest that PEBT could be considered a candidate for the prevention of memory deficits such as those observed in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have suggested that long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) activity can moderate the onset or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus it has been suggested that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ), a major end-product of COX, may play a pathogenic role in AD, but the involvement of PGE synthase (PGES), a terminal enzyme downstream from COX, has not been fully elucidated. Here we found that, among three PGES enzymes, only microsomal PGES-1 (mPGES-1) is induced, and its expression is associated with beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in the cerebral cortex in human AD patients and in Tg2576 mice, a transgenic AD mouse model. Furthermore, to investigate whether mPGES-1 contributes to AD-like pathology, we bred mPGES-1-deficient mice with Tg2576 mice. We found that mPGES-1 deletion reduced the accumulation of microglia around senile plaques and attenuated learning impairments in Tg2576 mice. These results indicated that mPGES-1 is induced in the AD brain and thus plays a role in AD pathology. Blockage of mPGES-1 could form the basis for a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with AD.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulated hippocampal neurogenesis has been associated with neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which it may potentially represent an auto-reparatory mechanism that could counteract neuronal loss and cognitive impairment. We evaluated hippocampal neurogenesis in TgCRND8 mice and reported that, at 32 weeks of age, corresponding to an advanced AD-like neuropathology stage, increased numbers of proliferating cells, doublecortin-expressing progenitors/neuroblasts, and early postmitotic calretinin-expressing neurons were present compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. When hippocampal neural progenitor cells (NPCs) were isolated from TgCRND8 mice, we demonstrated that (1) their neurogenic potential was higher compared with WT NPCs; (2) medium conditioned by TgCRND8 NPC promoted neuronal differentiation of WT NPCs; and (3) the proneurogenic effect of TgCRND8-conditioned medium was counteracted by blockade of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) axis. Furthermore, we showed that beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta(1-42)) oligomers, but not monomers and fibrils, and the alarmin high-mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB-1) could promote neuronal differentiation of NPCs via activation of the RAGE/NF-kappaB axis. Altogether, these data suggest that, in AD brain, an endogenous proneurogenic response could be potentially triggered and involve signals (Abeta(1-42) oligomers and HMGB-1) and pathways (RAGE/NF-kappaB activation) that also contribute to neuroinflammation/neurotoxicity. A more detailed analysis confirmed no significant increase of new mature neurons in hippocampi of TgCRND8 compared with WT mice, suggesting reduced survival and/or integration of newborn neurons. Therapeutic strategies in AD should ideally combine the ability of sustaining hippocampal neurogenesis as well as of counteracting an hostile brain microenvironment so to promote survival of vulnerable cell populations, including adult generated neurons.",

Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism of (MeOPhSe)2 neuroprotection in cortical neurons exposed to amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide as well as in Abeta-infused mice. For this purpose, primary cultures of rat cortical neurons were pre-incubated with 10 muM of (MeOPhSe)2 or vehicle, followed by exposure to 25 muM Abeta fragment 25-35 or vehicle. Furthermore, the therapeutic effect of (MeOPhSe)2 (5 mg/kg, oral route, daily for 5 days) on memory deficits was evaluated in mice exposed to Abeta fragment 25-35 (3 nmol/3 mul/per site, intracerebroventricular infusion). The results demonstrate that (MeOPhSe)2 prevented Abeta-induced cell death in vitro, associated with inhibition of caspase-3 and -9 activities, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. Further, (MeOPhSe)2 rescued Abeta-induced memory impairment in mice.

    "title": "Abeta-induced senescent retinal pigment epithelial cells create a proinflammatory microenvironment in AMD.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Chronic inflammation is implicated in the pathogenesis of AMD. The source of chronic inflammation is often attributed to the progressive activation of immune cells over time. However, recent studies have shown that senescent cells can alter tissue microenvironment via secretion of growth factors, proteases, and inflammatory cytokines and might be an additional source of chronic inflammation. We hypothesized that altered secretory pattern in Abeta-induced senescent RPE cells may contribute to compromised RPE barrier integrity and chronic inflammation in AMD. METHODS: Senescence was assessed by measuring the SA-beta-Galactosidase activity, the expressions of p16(INK4a) and ATM, and cell cycle analysis. Expressions of IL-8 and MMPs were analyzed by RT-PCR, ELISA, and gelatin zymography. The barrier structures of RPE cells were detected by actin-tracker, ZO-1, claudin-19, occludin immunochemistry, and Western blot; barrier function was analyzed by measuring transepithelial resistance (TER) and transepithelial diffusion rate of FITC-dextran. For inhibitory studies, MMP-9 was inhibited by RNA interference strategy. RESULTS: Abeta promotes RPE cells to enter senescence and secrete higher concentrations of IL-8 and MMP-9. Secretion of MMP-9 is associated with compromised barrier integrity and with processing of IL-8 to a more activated form. Silence of MMP-9 preserved the barrier integrity of senescent RPE cells. CONCLUSIONS: The altered secretory phenotype of senescent RPE cells may contribute to age-related inflammation in AMD. Chinese Abstract.",

Here we describe an approach for modeling IDPs with similar sequences that simplifies the comparison of the ensembles by utilizing a single library of structures. The relative population weights of the structures are estimated using a Bayesian formalism, which provides measures of uncertainty in the resulting ensembles. We applied this approach to the comparison of ensembles for Abeta40 and Abeta42. Bayesian hypothesis testing finds that although both Abeta species sample beta-rich conformations in solution that may represent prefibrillar intermediates, the probability that Abeta42 samples these prefibrillar states is roughly an order of magnitude larger than the frequency in which Abeta40 samples such structures. Moreover, the structure of the soluble prefibrillar state in our ensembles is similar to the experimentally determined structure of Abeta that has been implicated as an intermediate in the aggregation pathway. Overall, our approach for comparative studies of IDPs with similar sequences provides a platform for future studies on the effect of mutations on the structure and function of disordered proteins.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) varies in length at its carboxyl terminus. The longer Abeta species, Abeta43 and Abeta42, are highly amyloidogenic and deposit more frequently than Abeta40 in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. However, the characterization of Abeta43 deposition in the brain and the relationship between Abeta43 and Abeta42 or Abeta40 remain unclear. We provide evidence that Abeta43 deposition appears earlier than Abeta42 and Abeta40 deposition in the brain of mutant amyloid precursor protein transgenic (APPtg) mice, suggesting that Abeta43 is the earliest-depositing species. In addition, we found increased Abeta43 levels and Abeta43/Abeta42 ratios in the serum of AD patients, suggesting their use as diagnostic blood biomarkers for AD. We further show that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts Abeta43 to Abeta41. Notably, this Abeta43-to-Abeta41 converting activity requires two active domains of ACE. Inhibition of ACE activity significantly enhanced Abeta43 deposition in APPtg mouse brain. Our results suggest that Abeta43 is the earliest-depositing species in brain parenchyma and that Abeta43 may trigger later Abeta42 and Abeta40 deposition or may be converted to Abeta42 and Abeta40 plaques. Activities of both ACE domains may be important for reducing Abeta43 levels in serum and reducing brain Abeta43 deposition.",

    "abstract": "AIM: Oxidative stress is considered one of the main events that lead to aging and neurodegeneration. Antioxidant treatments used to counteract oxidative damage have been associated with a wide variety of side effects or at the utmost to be ineffective. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antioxidant property of a natural mineral, the tribomechanically micronized zeolite (MZ). MAIN METHODS: Cell death and oxidative stress were assessed in retinoic acid differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, a neuronal-like cell line, after a pro-oxidant stimulus. In vivo evaluation of antioxidant activity and amyloidogenic processing of beta amyloid have been evaluated in a transgenic model of aging related neurodegeneration, the APPswePS1dE9 transgenic mice (tg mice) after a five-month long period of water supplementation with MZ. KEY FINDINGS: The study showed that 24h of cell pretreatment with MZ (1) protected the cells by radical oxygen species (ROS)-induced cell death and moreover (2) induced a reduction of the mitochondrial ROS production following a pro-oxidant stimulation. Looking for an antioxidant effect of MZ in vivo, we found (3) an increased activity of the endogenous antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the hippocampus of tg mice and (4) a reduction in amyloid levels and plaque load in MZ treated tg mice compared to control tg mice. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest MZ as a novel potential adjuvant in counteracting oxidative stress and plaque accumulation in the field of neurodegenerative diseases.",

However, FAD mutations account for only 1-2% of Alzheimer's disease cases, leaving the experience-dependent mechanisms regulating Abeta40/42 an enigma. Here we explored regulation of Abeta40/42 ratio by temporal spiking patterns in the rodent hippocampus. Spike bursts boosted Abeta40/42 through a conformational change in presenilin1 (PS1), the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase, and subsequent increase in Abeta40 production. Conversely, single spikes did not alter basal PS1 conformation and Abeta40/42. Burst-induced PS1 conformational shift was mediated by means of Ca(2+)-dependent synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Presynaptic inhibition in vitro and visual deprivation in vivo augmented synaptic and Abeta40/42 facilitation by bursts in the hippocampus. Thus, burst probability and transfer properties of synapses represent fundamental features regulating Abeta40/42 by experience and may contribute to the initiation of the common, sporadic Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Pin1 (peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase, NIMA-interacting 1) plays a key role in a number of diseases including cancer and Alzheimer disease. Previous studies have identified a wide range of phosphoproteins as Pin1 substrates. Related pathways were analyzed separately. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive picture involving Pin1 regulation. A genome-wide mRNA expression microarray was carried out using the RNA isolation from Pin1 (+/+) and Pin1 (-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. Signaling pathways regulated by Pin1 were analyzed with the utility of KEGG pathway and GO annotation. An expression pattern regulated by Pin1 was revealed. A total of 606 genes, 375 being up-regulated and 231 down-regulated, were differentially expressed when comparing Pin1 +/+ to Pin1 -/- MEF cells. Totally 48 pathways were shown to be regulated by Pin1 expression in KEGG pathway analysis. In the GO annotation system, 19 processes on biological processes, 15 processes on cellular components, and 18 processes on molecular functions were found to be in the regulation of Pin1 expression. Pathways related to immune system and cancer showed most significant association with Pin1 regulation. Pin1 is an important regulator in a wide range of signaling pathways that were related to immune system and cancer.",

    "abstract": "Incomplete response to monoaminergic antidepressants in major depressive disorder (MDD), and the phenomenon of neuroprogression, suggests a need for additional pathophysiological markers and pharmacological targets. Neuronal zinc is concentrated exclusively within glutamatergic neurons, acting as an allosteric modulator of the N-methyl D-aspartate and other receptors that regulate excitatory neurotransmission and neuroplasticity. Zinc-containing neurons form extensive associational circuitry throughout the cortex, amygdala and hippocampus, which subserve mood regulation and cognitive functions. In animal models of depression, zinc is reduced in these circuits, zinc treatment has antidepressant-like effects and dietary zinc insufficiency induces depressive behaviors. Clinically, serum zinc is lower in MDD, which may constitute a state-marker of illness and a risk factor for treatment-resistance. Marginal zinc deficiency in MDD may relate to multiple putative mechanisms underlying core symptomatology and neuroprogression (e.g. immune dysfunction, monoamine metabolism, stress response dysregulation, oxidative/nitrosative stress, neurotrophic deficits, transcriptional/epigenetic regulation of neural networks). Initial randomized trials suggest a benefit of zinc supplementation. In summary, molecular and animal behavioral data support the clinical significance of zinc in the setting of MDD.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation, through production of proinflammatory molecules and activated glial cells, is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. One such proinflammatory mediator is tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), a multifunctional cytokine produced in excess and associated with amyloid beta-driven inflammation and cognitive decline. Long-term global inhibition of TNF receptor type I (TNF-RI) and TNF-RII signaling without cell or stage specificity in triple-transgenic AD mice exacerbates hallmark amyloid and neurofibrillary tangle pathology. These observations revealed that long-term pan anti-TNF-alpha inhibition accelerates disease, cautions against long-term use of anti-TNF-alpha therapeutics for AD, and urges more selective regulation of TNF signaling. We used adeno-associated virus vector-delivered siRNAs to selectively knock down neuronal TNF-R signaling. We demonstrate divergent roles for neuronal TNF-RI and TNF-RII where loss of opposing TNF-RII leads to TNF-RI-mediated exacerbation of amyloid beta and Tau pathology in aged triple-transgenic AD mice. Dampening of TNF-RII or TNF-RI+RII leads to a stage-independent increase in Iba-1-positive microglial staining, implying that neuronal TNF-RII may act nonautonomously on the microglial cell population. These results reveal that TNF-R signaling is complex, and it is unlikely that all cells and both receptors will respond positively to broad anti-TNF-alpha treatments at various stages of disease. In aggregate, these data further support the development of cell-, stage-, and/or receptor-specific anti-TNF-alpha therapeutics for AD.",

Analysis of total amyloid-beta (Abeta) distribution in frontal cortex and posterior cingulate gyrus confirmed its statistically significant correlation with cortical [18F]FDDNP PET binding values (distribution volume ratios, DVR) (p < 0.001, R = 0.97, R2 = 0.94). Neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) distribution correlated significantly with cortical [18F]FDDNP PET DVR in the temporal lobe (p < 0.001, R = 0.87, R2 = 0.76). Linear combination of Abeta and NFT densities was highly predictive of [18F]FDDNP PET DVR through all analyzed regions of interest (p < 0.0001, R = 0.92, R2 = 0.85), and both densities contributed significantly to the model. Lewy bodies were present at a much lower level than either Abeta or NFTs and did not significantly contribute to the in vivo signal. [18F]FDG PET scan results in this patient were consistent with the distinctive DLB pattern of hypometabolism.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive deterioration of cognitive abilities, amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation, neurofibrillary tangle deposition, synaptic alterations, and oxidative injury. In AD patients, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity is low in most regions of the brain, but increased within and around amyloid plaques, where it accelerates the Abeta assembly into oligomers and fibrils, increasing its neurotoxicity. Tetrahydrohyperforin (THH), a semi-synthetic derivative of hyperforin, reduces tau phosphorylation and Abeta accumulation in AD mouse models. In the present study, we examined the effects of THH on Abeta-AChE complexes, alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7-nAChR), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) adducts, caspase-3 activation, and spatial memory in young AbetaPPSwe/PSEN1DeltaE9 (AbetaPP/PS1) transgenic mice, in order to evaluate its potential preventive effects on the development of the disease. We report here that treatment with THH prevents the association of AChE to different types of amyloid plaques; partially restores the brain distribution of AChE molecular forms; increases alpha7-nAChR levels in the hippocampus of treated mice; decreases the amount of these receptors in amyloid plaques; and reduces the oxidative damage, evidenced by 4-HNE adduct formation and caspase-3 activation on AbetaPP/PS1 mice brain; demonstrating the neuroprotective properties of THH. Finally, we found that the acute treatment of hippocampal neurons with THH, in the presence of Abeta-AChE complexes, prevents 4-HNE adduct formation and caspase-3 activation. Our data support a therapeutic potential of THH for the treatment of AD.",

    "title": "Transthyretin as both a sensor and a scavenger of beta-amyloid oligomers.",
    "abstract": "Transthyretin (TTR) is a homotetrameric transport protein, assembled from monomers that each contain two four-stranded beta-sheets and a short alpha-helix and loop. In the tetramer, the \"inner\" beta-sheet forms a hydrophobic pocket while the helix and loop are solvent-exposed. beta-Amyloid (Abeta) aggregates bind to TTR, and the level of binding is significantly reduced in mutants L82A (on the loop) and L110A (on the inner beta-sheet). Protection against Abeta toxicity was demonstrated for wild-type TTR but not L82A or L110A, providing a direct link between TTR-Abeta binding and TTR-mediated cytoprotection. Protection is afforded at substoichiometric (1:100) TTR:Abeta molar ratios, and the level of binding of Abeta to TTR is highest for partially aggregated materials and decreased for freshly prepared or heavily aggregated Abeta, suggesting that TTR binds selectively to soluble toxic Abeta aggregates. A novel technique, nanoparticle tracking, is used to show that TTR arrests Abeta aggregation by both preventing formation of new aggregates and inhibiting growth of existing aggregates. TTR tetramers are normally quite stable; tetrameric structure is necessary for the protein's transport functions, and mutations that decrease tetramer stability have been linked to TTR amyloid diseases. However, TTR monomers bind more Abeta than do tetramers, presumably because the hydrophobic inner sheet is solvent-exposed upon tetramer disassembly. Wild-type and L110A tetramers, but not L82A, were destabilized upon being co-incubated with Abeta, suggesting that binding of Abeta to L82 triggers tetramer dissociation. Taken together, these results suggest a novel mechanism of action for TTR: the EF helix/loop \"senses\" the presence of soluble toxic Abeta oligomers, triggering destabilization of TTR tetramers and exposure of the hydrophobic inner sheet, which then \"scavenges\" these toxic oligomers and prevents them from causing cell death.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between the ApoE genotype and age at onset in a cohort of hospital-based AD patients of Han population in China. METHODS: All cases were consecutive probable AD patients from the Memory and Cognitive Impairment Clinic of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 1999 to 2010. They were all Han ethnicity. They were divided into two groups according to age at onset (AAO): early onset AD (EOAD, AAO < 65 years) and late onset AD (LOAD, AAO >= 65 years). DNA was extracted and ApoE was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The linkage between ApoE polymorphism and AAO of AD were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: AAO of all cases (n = 495) was (69 +- 10) years, of EOAD (n = 149) was (58 +- 5) years and of LOAD (n = 346) was (74 +- 6) years. ApoEepsilon4(+) genotypes were not associated with AAO of EOAD [epsilon4-/-: (57 +- 5) years, n = 90; epsilon4+/-: (59 +- 5) years, n = 50; epsilon4+/+: (59 +- 5) years, n = 9; F = 0.99, P = 0.38], while they were significantly associated with AAO of LOAD [epsilon4-/-: ( 75 +- 6) years, n = 189; epsilon4+/-: (73 +- 6) years, n = 138; epsilon4+/+: (71 +- 5) years, n = 19; F = 6.51, P = 0.002]. As for all ApoE genotypes, AAO of LOAD reduced gradually in a way as follows: epsilon2/3 > epsilon3/3 > epsilon3/4 > epsilon2/4 > epsilon4/4. There was great correlation between AAO and ApoE polymorphism in LOAD without dementia family history, whereas no correlation in LOAD with dementia family history. CONCLUSION: ApoE genotypes carrying at least one epsilon4 allele maybe significantly lower AAO of LOAD in a dose-dependent manner whereas no such correlation in LOAD with dementia family history.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To understand the cleavage of the amyloid beta protein (Abeta) precursor (APP) by gamma-secretase and to determine its changes in a representative familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) mutation. METHODS: Transfected cells expressing wild-type and FAD mutant APP were analyzed for changes in the levels of the major secreted Abeta species and of the corresponding intracellular C-terminal APP fragments (APP intracellular domain, AICD) generated by gamma-secretase, whereas radio-sequencing was used to precisely identify the resulting cleavage site(s). RESULTS: The AICD fragment(s) generated by gamma-secretase cleavage comigrated in gels with a 50-residue synthetic peptide used as control, which is smaller than the 59 and 57 residues predicted from Abeta ending at positions 40 (Abeta40) and 42 (Abeta42), respectively. In agreement with previous findings, an FAD mutant form of presenilin 1 (PS1-M139V) significantly increased the longer Abeta42 while showing trends toward reducing Abeta40. AICD levels were reduced by the mutation, suggesting that gamma-secretase activity may be actually impaired by the mutation. Radiosequence analysis in cells expressing wild-type PS1 detected gamma-secretase cleavage sites at the Abeta peptide bond L(49)-V(50) to generate a 50-amino acid (aa) AICD fragment (AICD50) and the Abeta peptide bond T(48)-L(49), generating an AICD of 51 aa (AICD51). No other cleavage sites were reliably detected. CONCLUSIONS: Based on findings that the FAD mutation that increases Abeta42 also reduces AICD, we propose that gamma-secretase activity is impaired by FAD mutations and predict that physiologic and environmental agents that inhibit gamma-secretase will actually induce AD pathogenesis rather that prevent it. Furthermore, we propose that the cleavage site to generate AICD is naturally ragged and occurs predominantly at two sites 48 and 49 aa from the start of the Abeta sequence. Thus, end specific antibodies to these two sites will need to be generated to study the quantitative relationships between these two cleavages in sporadic AD and FAD.",

    "abstract": "The beta-amyloid fragment peptide 25-35 (Abeta(25-35)) is recognized as the cytotoxic sequence of the parent peptide Abeta. However, it remains unclear whether its neurotoxicity originates from its fibrillar form, how it interacts with lipid membranes, and whether cholesterol modulates these interactions. These questions have been addressed at a molecular level using various microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. The data show that Abeta(25-35) forms protofilaments at pH 7.4 at a concentration of 5 mM in the absence and presence of DMPC/DMPG model membranes. The peptide adopts a predominant aggregated beta-sheet conformation under these conditions. However, as the peptide concentration decreases, the beta-sheet structure tends to disappear for the benefit of beta-turns, suggesting that the peptide association is reversible. The beta-sheet structure formed by Abeta(25-35) appears to be atypical and characterized by the absence of intermolecular dipolar coupling and by a parallel strand configuration. The data show that Abeta(25-35)-phospholipid interactions are characterized by an increase in the conformational order of the lipid acyl chains and a change in the fluidity/elasticity of the bilayers. Concomitantly, the peptide seems to lose a few beta-sheet structures, which suggests that the interactions between Abeta(25-35) and DMPC/DMPG membranes are partly driven by peptide concentration. Interactions indeed seem to occur when part of the peptides is not involved in protofilaments and increase as the proportion of the free peptide species increases. The interactions are very similar in the presence of cholesterol, except that the concentration effect of Abeta(25-35) is cancelled, suggesting that Chol limits the penetration of the peptide inside the bilayers.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to validate the feasibility of a voxel-based analysis of in vivo amyloid-beta positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. PROCEDURES: We performed [(11)C]PiB PET imaging in 20 APP/PS1 mice and 16 age-matched controls, and histologically determined the individual amyloid-beta plaque load. Using SPM software, we performed a voxel-based group comparison plus a regression analysis between PiB retention and actual plaque load, both thresholded at p FWE < 0.05. In addition, we carried out an individual ROI analysis in every animal. RESULTS: The automated voxel-based group comparison allowed us to identify voxels with significantly increased PiB retention in the cortical and hippocampal regions in transgenic animals compared to controls. The voxel-based regression analysis revealed a significant association between this signal increase and the actual cerebral plaque load. The validity of these results was corroborated by the individual ROI-based analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Voxel-based analysis of in vivo amyloid-beta PET imaging studies in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease is feasible and allows studying the PiB retention patterns in whole brain maps. Furthermore, the selected approach in our study also allowed us to establish a quantitative relation between tracer retention and actual plaque pathology in the brain in a voxel-wise manner.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The 'amyloid cascade hypothesis' remains the leading hypothesis to explain the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Immunotherapeutic agents have been developed to remove the neurotoxic amyloid beta42 protein and prevent the hypothesized amyloid beta42-induced neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. The most notable of these immunotherapies are bapineuzumab and solanezumab. AREAS COVERED: This article briefly reviews the experimental agents in development for treatment of AD and then discusses the results of bapineuzumab and solanezumab in AD patients, as reported in preclinical studies, clinical trials and press releases. EXPERT OPINION: Phase III trials showed that bapineuzumab failed to improve cognitive and functional performances in AD patients, and was associated with a high incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Solanezumab's two Phase III trials in AD patients failed to meet endpoints when analyzed independently. However, analysis of pooled data from both trials showed a significant reduction in cognitive decline in mild AD patients. The improvement was associated with an increase in plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels and a low incidence of ARIA in solanezumab-treated patients. The marginal benefits of solanezumab are encouraging to support continued evaluation in future studies, and offer small support in favor of the ongoing viability of the 'amyloid cascade hypothesis' of AD.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients deteriorate faster than the healthy elderly population and have an increased risk of developing dementia. Certain blood molecular biomarkers have been identified as prognostic markers in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study was aimed to assess the status of the platelet amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism in MCI and AD subjects and establish to what extent any variation could have a prognostic value suggestive of predictive AD in MCI patients. Thirty-four subjects diagnosed with MCI and 45 subjects with AD were compared to 28 healthy elderly individuals for assessing for protein levels of APP, beta-APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), presenilin 1 (PS1) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-10 (ADAM-10) by western blot, and for the enzyme activities of BACE1 and gamma-secretase by using specific fluorogenic substrates, in samples of platelets. A similar pattern in the healthy elderly and MCI patients was found for BACE1 and PS1 levels. A reduction of APP levels in MCI and AD patients compared with healthy elderly individuals was found. Augmented levels of ADAM-10 in both MCI and AD were displayed in comparison with age-matched control subjects. The ratio ADAM-10/BACE1 was higher for the MCI group versus AD group. Whereas BACE1 and PS1 levels were only increased in AD regarding to controls, BACE1 and gamma-secretase activities augmented significantly in both MCI and AD groups. Finally, differences and similarities between MCI and AD patients were observed in several markers of platelet APP processing. Larger sample sets from diverse populations need to be analyzed to define a signature for the presence of MCI or AD pathology and to early detect AD at the MCI stage.",

The \"amyloid cascade hypothesis\" posits that cerebral amyloid sets neurotoxic events into motion that precipitate Alzheimer dementia (Hardy and Allsop, 1991). Yet, faithful recapitulation of all AD features in widely used transgenic (Tg) mice engineered to overproduce Abeta peptides has been elusive. We have developed a Tg rat model (line TgF344-AD) expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APPsw) and presenilin 1 (PS1DeltaE9) genes, each independent causes of early-onset familial AD. TgF344-AD rats manifest age-dependent cerebral amyloidosis that precedes tauopathy, gliosis, apoptotic loss of neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and cognitive disturbance. These results demonstrate progressive neurodegeneration of the Alzheimer type in these animals. The TgF344-AD rat fills a critical need for a next-generation animal model to enable basic and translational AD research.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: (11)C-Pittsburgh compound-B ((11)C-PiB) is the benchmark radiotracer for imaging of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque in Alzheimer disease (AD). (18)F-labeled Abeta tracers subsequently developed for clinical use show higher nonspecific white matter binding and, in some cases, lower cortical binding in AD that could lead to less accurate interpretation of scans. We compared the cortical and white matter binding of a new (18)F-labeled Abeta tracer, (18)F-AZD4694 (recently renamed NAV4694), with (11)C-PiB in the same subjects. METHODS: Forty-five participants underwent PET imaging with (11)C-PiB and (18)F-AZD4694 (25 healthy elderly controls [HCs], 10 subjects with mild cognitive impairment, 7 subjects with probable AD, and 3 subjects with probable frontotemporal dementia). Images were coregistered so that region-of-interest placement was identical on both scans, and standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) using the cerebellar cortex as a reference region were calculated between 40 and 70 min after injection for both tracers. RESULTS: (18)F-AZD4694 showed reversible binding kinetics similar to (11)C-PiB, reaching an apparent steady state at 50 min after injection. Both radiotracers showed a similar dynamic range of neocortical SUVR (1.1-3.3 and 1.0-3.2 SUVR for (11)C-PiB and (18)F-AZD4694, respectively) and identical low nonspecific white matter binding, with frontal cortex-to-white matter ratios of 0.7 +- 0.2 and 1.3 +- 0.2 for both radiotracers in HCs and AD subjects, respectively. There was an excellent linear correlation between (11)C-PiB and (18)F-AZD4694 neocortical SUVR (slope of 0.95, r = 0.99, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: (18)F-AZD4694 displays imaging characteristics nearly identical to those of (11)C-PiB. The low white matter and high cortical binding in AD indicate that this tracer is well suited to both clinical and research use.",

    "title": "Brain amyloid-beta oligomers in ageing and Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease begins about two decades before the onset of symptoms or neuron death, and is believed to be caused by pathogenic amyloid-beta aggregates that initiate a cascade of molecular events culminating in widespread neurodegeneration. The microtubule binding protein tau may mediate the effects of amyloid-beta in this cascade. Amyloid plaques comprised of insoluble, fibrillar amyloid-beta aggregates are the most characteristic feature of Alzheimer's disease. However, the correspondence between the distribution of plaques and the pattern of neurodegeneration is tenuous. This discrepancy has stimulated the investigation of other amyloid-beta aggregates, including soluble amyloid-beta oligomers. Different soluble amyloid-beta oligomers have been studied in several mouse models, but not systematically in humans. Here, we measured three amyloid-beta oligomers previously described in mouse models-amyloid-beta trimers, Abeta*56 and amyloid-beta dimers-in brain tissue from 75 cognitively intact individuals, ranging from young children to the elderly, and 58 impaired subjects with mild cognitive impairment or probable Alzheimer's disease. As in mouse models, where amyloid-beta trimers appear to be the fundamental amyloid-beta assembly unit of Abeta*56 and are present in young mice prior to memory decline, amyloid-beta trimers in humans were present in children and adolescents; their levels rose gradually with age and were significantly above baseline in subjects in their 70s. Abeta*56 levels were negligible in children and young adults, rose significantly above baseline in subjects in their 40s and increased steadily thereafter. Amyloid-beta dimers were undetectable until subjects were in their 60s; their levels then increased sharply and correlated with plaque load. Remarkably, in cognitively intact individuals we found strong positive correlations between Abeta*56 and two pathological forms of soluble tau (tau-CP13 and tau-Alz50), and negative correlations between Abeta*56 and two postsynaptic proteins (drebrin and fyn kinase), but none between amyloid-beta dimers or amyloid-beta trimers and tau or synaptic proteins. Comparing impaired with age-matched unimpaired subjects, we found the highest levels of amyloid-beta dimers, but the lowest levels of Abeta*56 and amyloid-beta trimers, in subjects with probable Alzheimer's disease. In conclusion, in cognitively normal adults Abeta*56 increased ahead of amyloid-beta dimers or amyloid-beta trimers, and pathological tau proteins and postsynaptic proteins correlated with Abeta*56, but not amyloid-beta dimers or amyloid-beta trimers. We propose that Abeta*56 may play a pathogenic role very early in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We compared the ability of molecular biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD), including amyloid imaging and CSF biomarkers (Abeta42, tau, ptau181, tau/Abeta42, ptau181/Abeta42), to predict time to incident cognitive impairment among cognitively normal adults aged 45 to 88 years and followed for up to 7.5 years. METHODS: Longitudinal data from Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center participants (N = 201) followed for a mean of 3.70 years (SD = 1.46 years) were used. Participants with amyloid imaging and CSF collection within 1 year of a clinical assessment indicating normal cognition were eligible. Cox proportional hazards models tested whether the individual biomarkers were related to time to incident cognitive impairment. \"Expanded\" models were developed using the biomarkers and participant demographic variables. The predictive values of the models were compared. RESULTS: Abnormal levels of all biomarkers were associated with faster time to cognitive impairment, and some participants with abnormal biomarker levels remained cognitively normal for up to 6.6 years. No differences in predictive value were found between the individual biomarkers (p > 0.074), nor did we find differences between the expanded biomarker models (p > 0.312). Each expanded model better predicted incident cognitive impairment than the model containing the biomarker alone (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that all AD biomarkers studied here predicted incident cognitive impairment, and support the hypothesis that biomarkers signal underlying AD pathology at least several years before the appearance of dementia symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Microglial cells closely interact with senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease and acquire the morphological appearance of an activated phenotype. The significance of this microglial phenotype and the impact of microglia for disease progression have remained controversial. To uncover and characterize putative changes in the functionality of microglia during Alzheimer's disease, we directly assessed microglial behavior in two mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Using in vivo two-photon microscopy and acute brain slice preparations, we found that important microglial functions - directed process motility and phagocytic activity - were strongly impaired in mice with Alzheimer's disease-like pathology compared to age-matched non-transgenic animals. Notably, impairment of microglial function temporally and spatially correlated with Abeta plaque deposition, and phagocytic capacity of microglia could be restored by interventionally decreasing amyloid burden by Abeta vaccination. These data suggest that major microglial functions progressively decline in Alzheimer's disease with the appearance of Abeta plaques, and that this functional impairment is reversible by lowering Abeta burden, e.g. by means of Abeta vaccination.",

Recent studies demonstrate that monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs), generated in vitro in the presence of amyloid beta1-42 peptide (Abeta1-42), show a functional alteration and an increased production of inflammatory molecules. Accordingly, MDDCs from AD patients show a more pronounced pro-inflammatory profile than DCs obtained from control subjects. In this study, we aimed at further investigating DC role in AD. Thus, we analyzed the in vitro effect of Abeta1-42 treatment on already differentiated DCs from AD patients, as compared to control subjects. We found that Abeta1-42 significantly decreases the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in DCs derived from AD patients but not from control subjects. Thus, possibly due to their Abeta-induced reduction of neurotrophic support to neurons, DCs from AD patients might contribute to brain damage by playing a part in Abeta-dependent neuronal toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress, hyperhomocysteinemia, altered DNA methylation, and insulin resistance in the brain are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the role of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in these events remains unclear. Intracellular cysteine is rate-limiting for synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH), and factors regulating cysteine uptake exert a powerful influence over cellular redox status, especially in mature neurons where cysteine synthesis via transsulfuration of homocysteine (HCY) is restricted. We investigated the effect of soluble Abeta oligomers (oAbeta) on basal and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-induced cysteine uptake mediated by the excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3) in cultured human neuronal cells. We also examined the effect of oAbeta on intracellular thiol metabolite levels, DNA methylation, and the transcription status of redox and methylation-associated genes. oAbeta inhibited EAAT3-mediated cysteine uptake, causing a decrease in intracellular cysteine and GSH levels. The ratio of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine to the methylation inhibitor S-adenosylhomocysteine was decreased, in association with an increase in HCY and a global decrease in DNA methylation, indicative of decreased activity of the redox-sensitive enzyme methionine synthase. These metabolic effects of oAbeta coincided with changes in the expression of redox and methylation pathway genes. The ability of oAbeta to modulate gene expression via their redox and methylation-dependent epigenetic effects may contribute to the pathology of AD and recognition of this mechanism may lead to novel treatment approaches. We describe a role of IGF-1 signaling in regulating redox and methylation homeostasis, and propose this to be a pathogenic target of oAbeta.",

In Alzheimer disease (AD) and individuals with mild cognitive impairment converting to AD, plasma sLRP1 levels are reduced and sLRP1 is oxidized, which results in diminished Abeta peripheral binding and higher levels of free Abeta in plasma. Experimental studies have shown that free circulating Abeta re-enters the brain and that sLRP1 and/or its recombinant wild type cluster IV (WT-LRPIV) prevent Abeta from entering the brain. Treatment of Alzheimer APPsw(+/0) mice with WT-LRPIV has been shown to reduce brain Abeta pathology. In addition to Abeta, LRPIV binds multiple ligands. To enhance LRPIV binding for Abeta relative to other LRP1 ligands, we generated a library of LRPIV-derived fragments and full-length LRPIV variants with glycine replacing aspartic acid residues 3394, 3556, and 3674 in the calcium binding sites. Compared with WT-LRPIV, a lead LRPIV-D3674G mutant had 1.6- and 2.7-fold higher binding affinity for Abeta40 and Abeta42 in vitro, respectively, and a lower binding affinity for other LRP1 ligands (e.g. apolipoprotein E2, E3, and E4 (1.3-1.8-fold), tissue plasminogen activator (2.7-fold), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (4.1-fold), and Factor Xa (3.8-fold)). LRPIV-D3674G cleared mouse endogenous brain Abeta40 and Abeta42 25-27% better than WT-LRPIV. A 3-month subcutaneous treatment of APPsw(+/0) mice with LRPIV-D3674G (40 mug/kg/day) reduced Abeta40 and Alphabeta42 levels in the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebrospinal fluid by 60-80% and improved cerebral blood flow responses and hippocampal function at 9 months of age.

    "abstract": "Although the Abeta(37-42) peptide has two opposite terminal charges, counterintuitively its current fibril amyloid structure reveals in register parallel beta-strands, as formed by the full length Abeta peptide. In this study, we carried out a replica exchange molecular dynamics simulation of 16 all-atom Abeta(37-42) peptides in explicit water starting from randomized and dispersed chains. The extensive conformational sampling (48 replicas, 460 ns/replica) with a total simulation time of 23 mus allows us to obtain a full picture on the equilibrium conformational distribution of oligomers and beta-sheet sizes and gain some insights into the oligomerization process at 300 K. At the peptide concentration of 12 mM, self-assembly is described by the condensation-polymerization mechanism with conversion from micelle-like to high beta-sheet structures. At equilibrium, the oligomer distribution consists of large aggregates and free monomers, representing 70% and 25% of all species, respectively. Though the formation/dissociation of beta-strand is high, the population of 4-5 fully parallel beta-strands, consistent with the arrangement in the current fibril, is marginal and that of 4-5 fully antiparallel beta-strands, consistent with amyloid polymorphism, is non-negligible. However, the system adopts essentially mixed parallel/antiparallel beta-strands. This indicates that a system of 16 Abeta(37-42) chains in explicit solvent still does not form more stable species that will irreversibly grow to a fibril, independently of polymorphism. Our results also suggest that the Abeta(37-42) fibril may display packing polymorphism with antiparallel beta-strands, in addition to the experimentally observed in register parallel beta-strands.",

    "title": "The case for soluble Abeta oligomers as a drug target in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Soluble Abeta oligomers are now widely recognized as key pathogenic structures in Alzheimer's disease. They inhibit synaptic function, leading to early memory deficits and synaptic degeneration, and they trigger the downstream neuronal signaling responsible for phospho-tau Alzheimer's pathology. The marginal effects observed in recent clinical studies of solanezumab, targeting monomeric Abeta, and bapineuzumab, targeting amyloid plaques, prompted expert comments that drug discovery efforts in Alzheimer's disease should focus on soluble forms of Abeta rather than fibrillar Abeta deposits found in amyloid plaques. Accumulating scientific data suggest that soluble Abeta oligomers represent the optimal intervention target within the amyloid manifold. Active drug discovery approaches include antibodies that selectively capture soluble Abeta oligomers, selective modifiers of oligomer assembly, and receptor antagonists. The onset of symptomatic clinical benefit is expected to be rapid for such agents, because neuronal memory signaling should normalize on blockage of soluble Abeta oligomers. This key feature is not shared by amyloid-lowering therapeutics, and it should translate into streamlined clinical development for oligomer-targeting drugs. Oligomer-targeting drugs should also confer long-term disease modification and slowing of disease progression, because they prevent the downstream signaling responsible for phospho-tau mediated cytoskeletal degeneration.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that several Abeta species, including Abeta40 and Abeta42, are present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Experimental results suggest that these species could play a role in Alzheimer's disease and might also have diagnostic significance. In the present work, the canine CSF beta-amyloid species profile has been identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization-time-of-flight/time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF) analysis after immunoprecipitation with different Abeta-specific antibodies. The results show that species arising from combined beta- and gamma-secretase activities in humans, such as Abeta1-33, Abeta1-34, Abeta1-37, Abeta1-38, Abeta1-39, Abeta1-40, and Abeta1-42, are also present in dogs. Species arising from combined alpha- and beta-secretase activities, as well as other Abeta-degrading enzymes, are also present in both human and canine CSF, with the exception of Abeta1-13, Abeta1-14, and Abeta1-18, which are not detected in dogs. A large number of species truncated at Glu-3 and Glu-11 have also been detected. To our knowledge, this work describes a most complete Abeta species profile from canine CSF. The similarities between the canine and human CSF Abeta profile reinforce the dog as a highly appropriate animal model for research in Alzheimer's disease.",

We hypothesized that histone H3 homeostasis is disrupted in association with the appearance of soluble Abeta at an early stage in AD progression. We identified, localized, and compared histone H3 modifications in multiple model systems (neural-like SH-SY5Y, primary neurons, Tg2576 mice, and AD neocortex), and narrowed our focus to investigate 3 key motifs associated with regulating transcriptional activation and inhibition: acetylated lysine 14, phosphorylated serine 10 and dimethylated lysine 9. Our results in vitro and in vivo indicate that multimeric soluble Abeta may be a potent signaling molecule indirectly modulating the transcriptional activity of DNA by modulating histone H3 homeostasis. These findings reveal potential loci of transcriptional disruption relevant to AD. Identifying genes that undergo significant epigenetic alterations in response to Abeta could aid in the understanding of the pathogenesis of AD, as well as suggesting possible new treatment strategies.",

Recent studies indicate that Abeta can disrupt excitatory glutamatergic synaptic function at synaptic level. However, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. In this study, we recorded evoked and spontaneous EPSCs in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons via whole-cell voltage-clamping methods and found that 1 muM Abeta can induce acute depression of basal glutamatergic synaptic transmission through both presynaptic and postsynaptic dysfunction. Moreover, we also found that Abeta-induced both presynaptic and postsynaptic dysfunction can be reversed by the inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B), FK506, whereas only postsynaptic disruption can be ameliorated by the inhibitor of PP1/PP2A, Okadaic acid (OA). These results indicate that PP1/PP2A and PP2B have overlapping but not identical functions in Abeta-induced acute depression of excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that soluble aggregates of amyloid-beta (Abeta) initiate the neurotoxicity that eventually leads to dementia in Alzheimer's disease. Knowledge on soluble aggregate structures will enhance our understanding of the relationship between structures and toxicities. Our group has reported a stable and homogeneous preparation of Abeta(1-42) oligomers that has been characterized by various biophysical techniques. Here, we have further analyzed this species by solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and compared NMR results to similar observations on amyloid fibrils. NMR experiments on Abeta(1-42) oligomers reveal chemical shifts of labeled residues that are indicative of beta-strand secondary structure. Results from two-dimensional dipolar-assisted rotational resonance experiments indicate proximities between I31 aliphatic and F19 aromatic carbons. An isotope dilution experiment further indicates that these contacts between F19 and I31 are intermolecular, contrary to models of Abeta oligomers proposed previously by others. For Abeta(1-42) fibrils, we observed similar NMR lineshapes and inter-side-chain contacts, indicating similar secondary and quaternary structures. The most prominent structural differences between Abeta(1-42) oligomers and fibrils were observed through measurements of intermolecular (13)C-(13)C dipolar couplings observed in PITHIRDS-CT experiments. PITHIRDS-CT data indicate that, unlike fibrils, oligomers are not characterized by in-register parallel beta-sheets. Structural similarities and differences between Abeta(1-42) oligomers and fibrils suggest that folded beta-strand peptide conformations form early in the course of self-assembly and that oligomers and fibrils differ primarily in schemes of intermolecular organization. Distinct intermolecular arrangements between Abeta(1-42) oligomers and fibrils may explain why this oligomeric state appears off-pathway for monomer self-assembly to fibrils.",

    "abstract": "To find out whether and how the adenine nucleotide translocator-1 (ANT-1) inhibition due to NH2htau and Abeta1-42 is due to an interplay between these two Alzheimer's peptides, ROS and ANT-1 thiols, use was made of mersalyl, a reversible alkylating agent of thiol groups that are oriented toward the external hydrophilic phase, to selectively block and protect, in a reversible manner, the -SH groups of ANT-1. The rate of ATP appearance outside mitochondria was measured as the increase in NADPH absorbance which occurs, following external addition of ADP, when ATP is produced by oxidative phosphorylation and exported from mitochondria in the presence of glucose, hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. We found that the mitochondrial superoxide anions, whose production is induced at the level of Complex I by externally added Abeta1-42 and whose release from mitochondria is significantly reduced by the addition of the VDAC inhibitor DIDS, modify the thiol group/s present at the active site of mitochondrial ANT-1, impair ANT-1 in a mersalyl-prevented manner and abrogate the toxic effect of NH2htau on ANT-1 when Abeta1-42 is already present. A molecular mechanism is proposed in which the pathological Abeta-NH2htau interplay on ANT-1 in Alzheimer's neurons involves the thiol redox state of ANT-1 and the Abeta1-42-induced ROS increase. This result represents an important innovation because it suggests the possibility of using various strategies to protect cells at the mitochondrial level, by stabilizing or restoring mitochondrial function or by interfering with the energy metabolism providing a promising tool for treating or preventing AD.",

Elucidation of the changes that may affect synapses is crucial for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms underlying AD, but ultrastructural preservation of human postmortem brain tissue is often poor, and classical methods for quantification of synapses have significant technical limitations. We previously observed changes in dendritic spines in plaque-free regions of the neuropil of the dentate gyrus of double-transgenic APP/PS1 (amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1) model mice by light microscopy. Here, we used electron microscopy to examine possible synaptic alterations in this region. We used standard stereologic techniques to determine numbers of synapses per volume. We were able to reconstruct and analyze thousands of synapses and their 3-dimensional characteristics using a focused ion beam/scanning electron microscope and 3-dimensional reconstruction software (EspINA), which performs semiautomated segmentation of synapses. Our results show that both numbers of synapses per volume and synaptic morphology are affected in plaque-free regions of APP/PS1 mice. Therefore, changes in the number and morphology of synapses seem to be widespread alterations in this animal model.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) genotype is a risk factor for poor outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly in young patients, but the underlying mechanisms are not known. By analogy to effects of APOE4 on the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD), the APOE genotype may influence beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau deposition after TBI. To test this hypothesis, we crossed 3xTG-AD transgenic mice carrying 3 human familial AD mutations (PS1(M146V), tauP(301)L, and APP(SWE)) to human ApoE2-, ApoE3-, and ApoE4-targeted replacement mice. Six- to 8-month-old 3xTG-ApoE mice were assayed by quantitative immunohistochemistry for amyloid precursor protein (APP), Abeta(1-40) (Abeta40), Abeta(1-42) (Abeta42), total human tau, and phospho-serine 199 (pS199) tau at 24 hours after moderate controlled cortical impact. There were increased numbers of APP-immunoreactive axonal varicosities in 3xTG-ApoE4 mice versus the other genotypes. This finding was repeated in a separate cohort of ApoE4-targeted replacement mice without human transgenes compared with ApoE3 and ApoE2 mice. There were no differences between genotypes in the extent of intra-axonal Abeta40 and Abeta42; none of the mice had extracellular Abeta deposition. Regardless of injury status, 3xTG-ApoE4 mice had more total human tau accumulation in both somatodendritic and intra-axonal compartments than other genotypes. These results suggest that the APOE4 genotype may have a primary effect on the severity of axonal injury in acute TBI.",

GNE-629 and GNE-892 concentrations and PD biomarkers including amyloid beta (Abeta) in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and secreted APPbeta (sAPPbeta) and secreted APPalpha (sAPPalpha) in the CSF were measured after a single oral administration of GNE-629 (100 mg/kg) or GNE-892 (30 or 100 mg/kg) in cynomolgus monkeys. A mechanistic PK-PD model was developed to simultaneously characterize the plasma Abeta and CSF Abeta, sAPPalpha, and sAPPbeta using GNE-629 in vivo data. This model was used to predict the in vivo effects of GNE-892 after adjustments based on differences in in vitro cellular activity and PK. The PK-PD model estimated GNE-629 CSF and free plasma IC50 of 0.0033 muM and 0.065 muM, respectively. These differences in CSF and free plasma IC50 suggest that different mechanisms are involved in Abeta formation in these two compartments. The predicted in vivo effects for GNE-892 using the PK-PD model were consistent with the observed data. In conclusion, a PK-PD model was developed to mechanistically describe the effects of BACE1 inhibition on Abeta, sAPPbeta, and sAPPalpha in the CSF, and Abeta in the plasma. This model can be used to prospectively predict in vivo effects of new BACE1 inhibitors using just their in vitro activity and PK data.",

Amyloid plaques are a required pathological marker for post mortem diagnosis, and Abeta peptide is regarded by most as a critical trigger at the very least. We present spectrochemical image analysis of brain tissue sections obtained with the mid-infrared beamline IRENI (InfraRed ENvironmental Imaging, Synchrotron Radiation Center, U Wisconsin-Madison), where the pixel resolution of 0.54 x 0.54 microm(2) permits analysis at sub-cellular dimensions. Spectrochemical images of dense core plaque found in hippocampus and cortex sections of two transgenic mouse models of AD (TgCRND8 and 3xTg) are compared with plaque images from a 91 year old apoE43 human AD case. Spectral analysis was done in conjunction with histochemical stains of serial sections. A lipid membrane-like spectral signature surrounded and infiltrated the dense core plaques in all cases. Remarkable compositional similarities in early stage plaques suggest similar routes to plaque formation, regardless of genetic predisposition or mammalian origin.",

Here we use multiscale simulations and analytical theory to unveil the early steps of the spontaneous self-assembly of membrane-embedded alpha-helical Abeta (1-40) peptides. Based on a simple analytical model describing the electrostatic repulsions among water-exposed charged residues, the presence of distorted structures called \"frustrated helices\" is predicted. Large scale (20 mus) Coarse Grained simulations of 36 replicas of Abeta (1-40) performed within a POPC lipid matrix confirmed the formation of supramolecular assemblies which resemble a twisted ribbon. Fully atomistic simulations have demonstrated the stability of these helical structures. Concomitant to the formation of these large assemblies, CG simulations evidenced membrane curvature and substantiate the view that these assemblies may entail mechanical stress on membrane structure. We think that these findings provide an alternative view to the traditional models that consider a conformational transition towards beta-sheet rich structures as a prerequisite for triggering membrane damage and, eventually, neurotoxicity.",

Recently, genome-wide association studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in PICALM gene as genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD). We analysed by western blotting with several anti-PICALM antibodies the pattern of expression of PICALM in human brain extracts. We found that PICALM was abnormally cleaved in AD samples and that the level of the uncleaved 65-75 kDa full-length PICALM species was significantly decreased in AD brains. Cleavage of human PICALM after activation of endogenous calpain or caspase was demonstrated in vitro. Immunohistochemistry revealed that PICALM was associated in situ with neurofibrillary tangles, co-localising with conformationally abnormal and hyperphosphorylated tau in LOAD, familial AD and Down syndrome cases. PHF-tau proteins co-immunoprecipitated with PICALM. PICALM was highly expressed in microglia in LOAD. These observations suggest that PICALM is associated with the development of AD tau pathology.

The purpose of our study was to determine the interaction between monomeric and oligomeric amyloid-beta (Abeta) and phosphorylated tau in AD neurons. Using postmortem brains from AD patients at different stages of disease progression and control subjects, and also from AbetaPP, AbetaPPxPS1, and 3xTg-AD mice, we studied the physical interaction between Abeta and phosphorylated tau. Using immunohistological and double-immunofluorescence analyses, we also studied the localization of monomeric and oligomeric Abeta with phosphorylated tau. We found monomeric and oligomeric Abeta interacted with phosphorylated tau in neurons affected by AD. Further, these interactions progressively increased with the disease process. These findings led us to conclude that Abeta interacts with phosphorylated tau and may damage neuronal structure and function, particularly synapses, leading to cognitive decline in AD patients. Our findings suggest that binding sites between Abeta and phosphorylated tau need to be identified and molecules developed to inhibit this interaction.",

    "title": "Diazoxide and cyclosporin A protect primary cholinergic neurons against beta-amyloid (1-42)-induced cytotoxicity.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Activation of mitochondrial (MitoKATP) channels was found to protect against anoxic and chemical stress in brain. This present study sought to investigate the ability of diazoxide and cyclosporin A to antagonize cytotoxicity induced by beta-amyloid peptide (A-beta1-42) in cultured rat primary basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. METHODS: Cytotoxicity was induced by A-beta1-42 (2 muM) in the presence of either diazoxide (500 muM), a selective opener of the mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel (MitoKATP), or cyclosporin A (20 muM), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MTP), or the combination of both the reagents. We determined cell morphology and cell viability using MTT assay and expression levels of anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2), pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, cytochrome C, caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3) using Western blotting at 24 hours and 72 hours. RESULTS: Cell viability decreased markedly after exposure to A-beta1-42 for 72 hours with a decrease in the expression of Bcl-2 protein and cytochrome C and an increase in the caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 levels. Both diazoxide and cyclosporin A exerted significant protective effects on cell viability by ameliorating the decrease in Bcl-2 and the increase in cytochrome c and caspase-3 activity induced by A-beta1-42. The combination of both the reagents had a greater protective effect than either one alone. CONCLUSIONS: The present research demonstrates that activation of MitoKATP channels independently or in combination with inhibitors of the MTP can elicit a protective effect against primary cholinergic neuron cytotoxicity induced by A-beta1-42. These findings suggest new mitochondrial targets for the development of therapeutic agents against A-beta-induced cytotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Active amyloid-beta (Abeta) immunotherapy is under investigation to prevent or treat early Alzheimer's disease (AD). In 2002, a Phase II clinical trial (AN1792) was halted due to meningoencephalitis in ~6% of the AD patients, possibly caused by a T-cell-mediated immunological response. Thus, generating a vaccine that safely generates high anti-Abeta antibody levels in the elderly is required. In this study, MER5101, a novel conjugate of Abeta1-15 peptide (a B-cell epitope fragment) conjugated to an immunogenic carrier protein, diphtheria toxoid (DT), and formulated in a nanoparticular emulsion-based adjuvant, was administered to 10-month-old APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 transgenic (Tg) and wild-type (Wt) mice. High anti-Abeta antibody levels were observed in both vaccinated APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 Tg and Wt mice. Antibody isotypes were mainly IgG1 and IgG2b, suggesting a Th2-biased response. Restimulation of splenocytes with the Abeta1-15:DT conjugate resulted in a strong proliferative response, whereas proliferation was absent after restimulation with Abeta1-15 or Abeta1-40/42 peptides, indicating a cellular immune response against DT while avoiding an Abeta-specific T-cell response. Moreover, significant reductions in cerebral Abeta plaque burden, accompanied by attenuated microglial activation and increased synaptic density, were observed in MER5101-vaccinated APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 Tg mice compared with Tg adjuvant controls. Last, MER5101-immunized APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 Tg mice showed improvement of cognitive deficits in both contextual fear conditioning and the Morris water maze. Our novel, highly immunogenic Abeta conjugate vaccine, MER5101, shows promise for improving Abeta vaccine safety and efficacy and therefore, may be useful for preventing and/or treating early AD.",

    "abstract": "Endosomal sorting of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a key role in the biogenesis of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. Genetic lesions underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) can act by interfering with this physiological process. Specifically, proteins involved in trafficking between endosomal compartments and the trans-Golgi network (TGN) [including the retromer complex (Vps35, Vps26) and its putative receptors (sortilin, SorL1, SorCS1)] have been implicated in the molecular pathology of late-onset AD. Previously, we demonstrated a role for SorCS1 in APP metabolism and Abeta production and, while we implicated a role for the retromer in this regulation, the underlying mechanism remained poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence for a motif within the SorCS1c cytoplasmic tail that, when manipulated, results in perturbed sorting of APP and/or its fragments to endosomal compartments, decreased retrograde TGN trafficking, and increased Abeta production in H4 neuroglioma cells. These perturbations apparently do not involve turnover of the cell surface APP pool, but rather they involve intracellular APP and/or its fragments, downstream of APP endocytosis.",

METHODS: Subjects who agreed to participate had a brain magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography scan with (11) C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) following completion of a Gb treatment clinical trial. The youngest subject in this imaging study was 82 years, and the mean age of the subjects was 85.5 years at the time of the scans; 152 (80%) were cognitively normal, and 38 (20%) were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at the time of the PiB study. RESULTS: A high proportion of the cognitively normal subjects (51%) and MCI subjects (68%) were PiB-positive. The APOE*4 allele was more prevalent in PiB-positive than in PiB-negative subjects (30% vs 6%). Measures of memory, language, and attentional functions were worse in PiB-positive than in PiB-negative subjects, when both normal and MCI cases were analyzed together; however, no significant associations were observed within either normal or MCI subject groups alone. There was no relationship between Gb treatment and Abeta deposition as determined by PiB. INTERPRETATION: The data revealed a 55% prevalence of PiB positivity in nondemented subjects age >80 years and 85% PiB positivity in the APOE*4 nondemented elderly subjects. The findings also showed that long-term exposure to Gb did not affect the prevalence of cerebral Abeta deposition.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore whether prevalence, survival, and incidence of dementia have changed from 1987-1994 to 2001-2008 in Stockholm, Sweden. METHODS: This study is based on 2 cross-sectional surveys of people aged 75 years or over conducted in central Stockholm: the Kungsholmen Project (KP) (1987-1989, n = 1,700) and the Swedish National study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K) (2001-2004, n = 1,575). In both surveys we diagnosed dementia according to DSM-III-R criteria, following the identical diagnostic procedure. Death certificates were used to determine survival status of KP participants as of December 1994 and SNAC-K participants as of June 2008. We used logistic and Cox models to compare prevalence and survival, controlling for major confounders. We inferred incidence of dementia according to its relationship with prevalence and survival. RESULTS: At baseline, 225 subjects in KP and 298 in SNAC-K were diagnosed with dementia. The age- and sex-standardized prevalence of dementia was 17.5% (12.8% in men; 19.2% in women) in KP and 17.9% (10.8% in men; 20.5% in women) in SNAC-K. The adjusted odds ratio of dementia in SNAC-K vs KP was 1.17 (95% confidence interval 0.95-1.46). The multiadjusted hazard ratio of death in SNAC-K vs KP was 0.71 (0.57-0.88) in subjects with dementia, 0.68 (0.59-0.79) in those without dementia, and 0.66 (0.59-0.74) in all participants. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of dementia was stable from the late 1980s to the early 2000s in central Stockholm, Sweden, whereas survival of patients with dementia increased. These results suggest that incidence of dementia may have decreased during this period.",

    "abstract": "Despite intense interest in the proteolysis of the beta-Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) in Alzheimer's disease, how the normal processing of this type I receptor-like glycoprotein is physiologically regulated remains ill-defined. In recent years, several candidate protein ligands for APP, including F-spondin, Reelin, beta1 Integrin, Contactins, Lingo-1, and Pancortin, have been reported. However, a cognate ligand for APP that regulates its processing by alpha- or beta-secretase has yet to be widely confirmed in multiple laboratories. Here, we developed new assays in an effort to confirm a role for one or more of these candidate ligands in regulating APP ectodomain shedding in a biologically relevant context. A comprehensive quantification of APPsalpha and APPsbeta, the immediate products of secretase processing, in both non-neuronal cell lines and primary neuronal cultures expressing endogenous APP yielded no evidence that any of these published candidate ligands stimulate ectodomain shedding. Rather, Reelin, Lingo-1, and Pancortin-1 emerged as the most consistent ligands for significantly inhibiting ectodomain shedding. These findings led us to conduct further detailed analyses of the interactions of Reelin and Lingo-1 with APP.",

    "abstract": "Activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc) and c-Fos are immediate early gene (IEG) products induced by novelty in the hippocampus and involved in the consolidation of synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. We investigated whether induction of arc and c-fos after exposure to a novel open field environment was compromised in different neocortical areas and the hippocampal formation in APP/PS1DeltaE9 transgenic mice characterized by pronounced accumulation and deposition of beta amyloid (Abeta). Notably, the basal level of Arc and c-fos mRNA in the neocortex was significantly lower in APP/PS1DeltaE9 compared to wild-type mice. Novelty exposure induced an increase in Arc and c-Fos mRNA in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), parietal cortex, and hippocampal formation in both APP/PS1DeltaE9 transgenic and wild-type mice. However, novelty-induced IEG expression did not reach the same levels in APP/PS1DeltaE9 as in the wild-type mice. In contrast, synaptophysin levels did not differ between mutant and wild type mice, suggesting that the observed effect was not due to a general decrease in the number of presynapses. These data suggest a reduction in basal and novelty-induced neuronal activity in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, which is most pronounced in cortical regions, indicating that a decreased functional response in IEG expression could be partly responsible for the cognitive deficits observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "beta-Amyloid (Abeta) oligomers impair brain-derived neurotrophic factor retrograde trafficking by down-regulating ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase, UCH-L1.",
    "abstract": "We previously found that BDNF-dependent retrograde trafficking is impaired in AD transgenic mouse neurons. Utilizing a novel microfluidic culture chamber, we demonstrate that Abeta oligomers compromise BDNF-mediated retrograde transport by impairing endosomal vesicle velocities, resulting in impaired downstream signaling driven by BDNF/TrkB, including ERK5 activation, and CREB-dependent gene regulation. Our data suggest that a key mechanism mediating the deficit involves ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), a deubiquitinating enzyme that functions to regulate cellular ubiquitin. Abeta-induced deficits in BDNF trafficking and signaling are mimicked by LDN (an inhibitor of UCH-L1) and can be reversed by increasing cellular UCH-L1 levels, demonstrated here using a transducible TAT-UCH-L1 strategy. Finally, our data reveal that UCH-L1 mRNA levels are decreased in the hippocampi of AD brains. Taken together, our data implicate that UCH-L1 is important for regulating neurotrophin receptor sorting to signaling endosomes and supporting retrograde transport. Further, our results support the idea that in AD, Abeta may down-regulate UCH-L1 in the AD brain, which in turn impairs BDNF/TrkB-mediated retrograde signaling, compromising synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival.",

Oligomers by the amyloid-beta peptide play a central role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, being implicated in synaptic dysfunction. Here we show that the oligomers formed by a protein that has no link with human disease, namely the N-terminal domain of HypF from Escherichia coli (HypF-N), are also synaptotoxic. HypF-N oligomers were found to (i) colocalize with post-synaptic densities in primary rat hippocampal neurons; (ii) induce impairment of long-term potentiation in rat hippocampal slices; and (iii) impair spatial learning of rats in the Morris Water Maze test. By contrast, the native protein and control nontoxic oligomers had none of such effects. These results raise the importance of using HypF-N oligomers as a valid tool to investigate the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, with advantages over other systems for their stability, reproducibility, and costs. The results also suggest that, in the context of a compromised protein homeostasis resulting from aggregation of the amyloid beta peptide, a number of oligomeric species sharing common synaptotoxic activity can arise and cooperate in the pathogenesis of the disease.",

In addition to plaques and tangles, an additional hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is damage to neurons that synthesize noradrenaline (NA). We characterized amyloid burden in the posterior temporal lobe of young and aged vervets, and compared that with changes in NA levels and astrocyte activation. Total amyloid beta (Abeta)40 and Abeta42 levels were increased in the aged group, as were numbers of amyloid plaques detected using antibody 6E10. Low levels of Abeta42 were detected in 1 of 5 younger animals, although diffusely stained plaques were observed in 4 of these. Increased glial fibrillary acidic protein staining and messenger RNA levels were significantly correlated with increased age, as were cortical NA levels. Levels of Abeta42 and Abeta40, and the number of 6E10-positive plaques, were correlated with NA levels. Interestingly messenger RNA levels of glial derived neurotrophic factor, important for noradrenergic neuronal survival, were reduced with age. These findings suggest that amyloid pathology in aged vervets is associated with astrocyte activation and higher NA levels.",

    "abstract": "Ginsenoside Rg1 is the main pharmacologically active compound of ginsenosides and has demonstrated pharmacological effects in the cardiovascular system, central nervous system and immune system. The involvement of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR)-dependent pathway and estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent pathway in the biological effect of ginsenoside Rg1 have been demonstrated in our previous study. The present study tested the hypothesis that the protective effects of Rg1 against Abeta25-35-induced toxicity involved activation of the IGF-IR and ER signaling pathways in PC12 cells. Treatment with Abeta25-35 decreased the cell viability in a dose-dependent manner in PC12 cells. Rg1 pretreatment resulted in an enhancement of survival and the maximum protection occurred at the concentration of 1muM. Co-treatment with IGF-IR antagonist JB-1 or ER antagonist ICI182,780 could completely block the protective effect of Rg1. The decreased Bcl-2 mRNA expression induced by Abeta25-35 could be restored by Rg1 pretreatment. Rg1 pretreatment could also restore the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential induced by Abeta25-35 and these effects could be completely blocked by JB-1 or ICI182,780. In addition, Rg1 treatment alone could significantly increase the phosphorylation level of MEK and ERK in a time-dependent manner and the functional transactivation of ERalpha in PC12 cells. The functional transactivation of ERalpha by Rg1 could be completely blocked by JB-1 or ICI182,780. Taken together, our results suggest that IGF-IR and ER signaling pathways might be involved in the protective effect of Rg1 against Abeta25-35-induced toxicity in PC12 cells.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is the major apolipoprotein present in the high-density lipoprotein-like particles in the central nervous system (CNS). ApoE is involved in various protective functions in CNS including cholesterol transport, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. An ApoE peptide would be expected to exert protective effects on neuroinflammation. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of an ApoE mimetic peptide Ac-hE18A-NH2 on amyloid-beta pathology. METHOD: Using human APP/PS1DeltaE9 transgenic mice and in vitro studies, we have evaluated the effect of an ApoE mimetic peptide, Ac-hE18A-NH2, on amyloid plaque deposition and inflammation. RESULTS: Administration of Ac-hE18A-NH2 to APP/PS1DeltaE9 mice for 6 weeks (50 mug/mouse, 3 times a week) significantly improved cognition with a concomitant decrease in amyloid plaque deposition and reduced activated microglia and astrocytes, and increased brain ApoE levels. Oligomeric Abeta42 (oAbeta42) and oxidized PAPC (ox-PAPC) inhibited secretion of ApoE in U251 cells, a human astrocyte cell line, and this effect was ameliorated in the presence of peptide Ac-hE18A-NH2. The peptide also increased Abeta42 uptake in a cell line of human macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Peptide Ac-hE18A-NH2 attenuates the effects of oxidative stress on ApoE secretion, inhibits amyloid plaque deposition, and thus could be beneficial in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Quantitative proteomic analysis of the hippocampus in the 5XFAD mouse model at early stages of Alzheimer's disease pathology.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive memory loss accompanied by synaptic and neuronal degeneration. Although research has shown that substantial neurodegeneration occurs even during the early stages of AD, the detailed mechanisms of AD pathogenesis are largely unknown because of difficulties in diagnosis and limitations of the analytical methods. The 5XFAD mouse model harbors five early-onset familial AD (FAD) mutations and displays substantial amyloid plaques and neurodegeneration. Here, we use quantitative mass spectrometry to identify proteome-wide changes in the 5XFAD mouse hippocampus during the early stages of AD pathology. A subset of the results was validated with immunoblotting. We found that the 5XFAD mice display higher expression of ApoE, ApoJ (clusterin), and nicastrin, three important proteins in AD that are known to participate in amyloid-beta processing and clearance, as well as the neurological damage/glial marker protein GFAP and other proteins. A large subset of the proteins that were up- or downregulated in 5XFAD brains have been implicated in neurological disorders and cardiovascular disease, suggesting an association between cardiovascular disease and AD. Common upstream regulator analysis of upregulated proteins suggested that the XBP1, NRF2, and p53 transcriptional pathways were activated, as was IGF-1R signaling. Protein interactome analysis revealed an interconnected network of regulated proteins, with two major sub-networks centered on AbetaPP processing membrane complexes and mitochondrial proteins. Together with a recent study on the transcriptome of 5XFAD mice, our study allows a comprehensive understanding of the molecular events occurring in 5XFAD mice during the early stages of AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease and common cause of dementias in the Western world. This study investigated the expression profile of heat-shock proteins (HSPs) involved in maintaining healthy neurons in the TASTPM AD mouse model, and whether chronic treatment with 1072 nm infra-red (IR1072) modified the expression profiles of HSPs and amyloidopathy in female TASTPM mice. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Quantitative immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were used to examine the expression of proteins such as HSPs, phosphorylated tau (tau-P), amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-amyloid1-40 (Abeta), and Abeta1-42. TASTPM mice at 3, 7 and 12 months were investigated as well as female TASTPM mice which had undergone a chronic, 5 month, IR1072 treatment. During the first 12 months of age, a critical period of AD progression, reduced HSP40 and HSP105 were observed. alphaB-crystallin, Abeta1-42 and tau-P increased over this period, particularly between 3 and 7 months. Chronic IR1072 treatment of female TASTPM mice elicited significant increases in HSP60, 70 and 105 and phosphorylated-HSP27 (P-HSP27) (50-139%), together with a concomitant profound decrease in alphaB-crystallin, APP, tau-P, Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 (43-81%) protein levels at 7 months of age. Furthermore, IR1072 treatment elicited a modest, but significant, reduction in Abeta1-42 plaques in the cerebral cortex. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS: IR1072 treatment provides a novel non-invasive and safe way to upregulate a panel of stress response proteins in the brain, known to both reduce protein aggregation and neuronal apoptosis. This approach recently entered clinical trials for AD in the USA, and may provide a novel disease modifying therapy for a range of neuropathologies.",

    "abstract": "The proteasome is the major protein degradation system within the cell, comprised of different proteolytic subunits; amyloid-beta is thought to impair its activity in Alzheimer's disease. Neuroinflammation is a prominent hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, which may implicate an activation of the immunoproteasome, a specific proteasome variant induced by immune signalling that holds slightly different proteolytic properties than the constitutive proteasome. Using a novel cell-permeable proteasome activity probe, we found that amyloid-beta enhances proteasome activity in glial and neuronal cultures. Additionally, using a subunit-specific proteasome activity assay we showed that in the cortex of the APPswePS1dE9 plaque pathology mouse model, immunoproteasome activities were strongly increased together with increased messenger RNA and protein expression in reactive glia surrounding plaques. Importantly, this elevated activity was confirmed in human post-mortem tissue from donors with Alzheimer's disease. These findings are in contrast with earlier studies, which reported impairment of proteasome activity in human Alzheimer's disease tissue and mouse models. Targeting the increased immunoproteasome activity with a specific inhibitor resulted in a decreased expression of inflammatory markers in ex vivo microglia. This may serve as a potential novel approach to modulate sustained neuroinflammation and glial dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease.",

We have created a new fluorescent bigenic mouse model of AD by crossing \"H-line\" yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) mice with the 5xFAD mouse model, which we call the 5XY mouse model. The 5xFAD mouse has been shown to have significant loss of L5 pyramidal neurons by 12 months of age. These neurons are transgenically labeled with YFP in the 5XY mouse, which enable longitudinal imaging of structural changes. In the 5XY mice, we observed an appearance of axonal dystrophies, with two distinct morphologies in the early stages of the disease progression. Simple swelling dystrophies are transient in nature and are not directly associated with amyloid plaques. Rosette dystrophies are more complex structures that remained stable throughout all imaging sessions, and always surrounded an amyloid plaque. Plaque growth was followed over 4 weeks, and significant growth was seen between weekly imaging sessions. In addition to axonal dystrophy appearance and plaque growth, we were able to follow spine stability in 4-month old 5XY mice, which revealed no significant loss of spines. 5XY mice also showed a striking shrinkage of the neocortex at older ages (12-14 months). The 5XY mouse model may be a valuable tool for studying specific events in the degeneration of the neocortex, and may suggest new avenues for therapeutic intervention.",

OBJECTIVE: To unveil differences in CSF concentrations of Abeta42, sAbetaPPalpha, sAbetaPPbeta, tTau, and SORL1 between patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who were categorized according to expert interpretation of FDG scans. METHODS: PET results were classified as suggesting high likelihood for AD (MCI-AD high), intermediate likelihood for AD (MCI-AD intermediate), or little likelihood for AD (MCI-AD unlikely). An AD dementia group was also included. Differences between the groups were tested by Kruskal- Wallis test, Mann-Whitney test, or chi2. Provided statistically significant differences were detected, multiple linear regression models were employed. RESULTS: Abeta42 levels in patients with MCI-AD high (n = 15) were lower compared to MCI-AD intermediate (n = 18) and MCI-AD unlikely patients (n = 25) (p = 0.002), while they did not differ from patients with AD dementia (n = 17). The regression model revealed a significant impact of the metabolic pattern on Abeta42 concentrations. SORL1, tTau, sAbetaPPalpha, and sAbetaPPbeta concentrations did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSION: These findings point to linkages between plaque pathology and glucose cerebral hypometabolism.",

    "abstract": "Many peptides and proteins can form fibrillar aggregates in vitro, but only a limited number of them are forming pathological amyloid structures in vivo. We studied the fibrillization of four peptides--Alzheimer's amyloid-beta (Abeta) 1-40 and 1-42, amylin and insulin. In all cases, intensive mechanical agitation of the solution initiated fast fibrillization. However, when the mixing was stopped during the fibril growth phase, the fibrillization of amylin and insulin was practically stopped, and the rate for Abeta40 substantially decreased, whereas the fibrillization of Abeta42 peptide continued to proceed with almost the same rate as in the agitated conditions. The reason for the different sensitivity of the in vitro fibrillization of these peptides towards agitation in the fibril growth phase remains elusive.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia in humans and is related to the accumulation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and its interaction with metals (Cu, Fe, and Zn) in the brain. Crystallographic structural information about Abeta peptide deposits and the details of the metal-binding site is limited owing to the heterogeneous nature of aggregation states formed by the peptide. Here, we present a crystal structure of Abeta residues 1-16 fused to the N-terminus of the Escherichia coli immunity protein Im7, and stabilized with the fragment antigen binding fragment of the anti-Abeta N-terminal antibody WO2. The structure demonstrates that Abeta residues 10-16, which are not in complex with the antibody, adopt a mixture of local polyproline II-helix and turn type conformations, enhancing cooperativity between the two adjacent histidine residues His13 and His14. Furthermore, this relatively rigid region of Abeta (residues, 10-16) appear as an almost independent unit available for trapping metal ions and provides a rationale for the His13-metal-His14 coordination in the Abeta1-16 fragment implicated in Abeta metal binding. This novel structure, therefore, has the potential to provide a foundation for investigating the effect of metal ion binding to Abeta and illustrates a potential target for the development of future Alzheimer's disease therapeutics aimed at stabilizing the N-terminal monomer structure, in particular residues His13 and His14, and preventing Abeta metal-binding-induced neurotoxicity.",

Understanding the sequelae of events that leads to cell death would provide insight into neuroprotective approaches. We imaged neurons in the living brain of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease that overexpresses mutant human amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 and followed the death of individual neurons in real time. This mouse model exhibited limited neurodegeneration and atrophy, but we were able to identify a small fraction of vulnerable cells that would not have been detectable by using standard approaches. By exploiting a genetically encoded reporter of oxidative stress, we identified susceptible neurons by their increased redox potential. The oxidative stress was most dramatic in neurites near plaques, propagated to cell bodies, and preceded activation of caspases that led to cell death within 24 h. Thus, local oxidative stress surrounding plaques contributes to long-range toxicity and selective neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Toward the molecular mechanism(s) by which EGCG treatment remodels mature amyloid fibrils.",
    "abstract": "Protein misfolding and/or aggregation has been implicated as the cause of several human diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and familial amyloid polyneuropathy. These maladies are referred to as amyloid diseases, named after the cross-beta-sheet amyloid fibril aggregates or deposits common to these disorders. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the principal polyphenol present in green tea, has been shown to be effective at preventing aggregation and is able to remodel amyloid fibrils comprising different amyloidogenic proteins, although the mechanistic underpinnings are unclear. Herein, we work toward an understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) by which EGCG remodels mature amyloid fibrils made up of Abeta(1-40), IAPP(8-24), or Sup35NM(7-16). We show that EGCG amyloid remodeling activity in vitro is dependent on auto-oxidation of the EGCG. Oxidized and unoxidized EGCG binds to amyloid fibrils, preventing the binding of thioflavin T. This engagement of the hydrophobic binding sites in Abeta(1-40), IAPP(8-24), or Sup35NM(Ac7-16) Y F amyloid fibrils seems to be sufficient to explain the majority of the amyloid remodeling observed by EGCG treatment, although how EGCG oxidation drives remodeling remains unclear. Oxidized EGCG molecules react with free amines within the amyloid fibril through the formation of Schiff bases, cross-linking the fibrils, which may prevent dissociation and toxicity, but these aberrant post-translational modifications do not appear to be the major driving force for amyloid remodeling by EGCG treatment. These insights into the molecular mechanism of action of EGCG provide boundary conditions for exploring amyloid remodeling in more detail.",

    "abstract": "Recently, small peptides have been shown to modulate aggregation and toxicity of the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta). As such, these new scaffolds may help discover a new class of biotherapeutics useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Many of these inhibitory peptide sequences have been derived from natural sources or from Abeta itself (e.g., C-terminal Abeta fragments). In addition, much earlier work indicates that tachykinins, a broad class of neuropeptides, display neurotrophic properties, presumably through direct interactions with either Abeta or its receptors. Based on this work, we undertook a limited screen of neuropeptides using ion mobility-mass spectrometry to search for similar such peptides with direct Abeta binding properties. Our results reveal that the neuropeptides leucine enkephalin (LE) and galanin interact with both the monomeric and small oligomeric forms of Abeta(1-40) to create a range of complexes having diverse stoichiometries, while some tachyknins (i.e., substance P) do not. LE interacts with Abeta more strongly than galanin, and we utilized ion mobility-mass spectrometry, molecular dynamics simulations, gel electrophoresis/Western blot, and transmission electron microscopy to study the influence of this peptide on the structure of Abeta monomer, small Abeta oligomers, as well as the eventual formation of Abeta fibrils. We find that LE binds selectively within a region of Abeta between its N-terminal tail and hydrophobic core. Furthermore, our data indicate that LE modulates fibril generation, producing shorter fibrillar aggregates when added in stoichiometric excess relative to Abeta.",

Prefoldin (PFD) is a molecular chaperone that prevents aggregation of misfolded proteins. Here we investigated the role of PFD in Abeta aggregation. First, we demonstrated that PFD is expressed in mouse brain by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry and found that PFD is upregulated in AD model APP23 transgenic mice. Then we investigated the effect of recombinant human PFD (hPFD) on Abeta(1-42) aggregation in vitro and found that hPFD inhibited Abeta fibrillation and induced formation of soluble Abeta oligomers. Interestingly, cell viability measurements using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay showed that Abeta oligomers formed by hPFD were 30-40% less toxic to cultured rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells or primary cortical neurons from embryonic C57BL/6CrSlc mice than previously reported Abeta oligomers (formed by archaeal PFD) and Abeta fibrils (p < 0.001). Thioflavin T measurements and immunoblotting indicated different structural properties for the different Abeta oligomers. Our findings show a relation between cytotoxicity of Abeta oligomers and structure and suggest a possible protective role of PFD in AD.",

    "title": "Development and mechanism of gamma-secretase modulators for Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "gamma-Secretase is an aspartyl intramembranal protease composed of presenilin, Nicastrin, Aph1, and Pen2 with 19 transmembrane domains. gamma-Secretase cleaves the amyloid precursor proteins (APP) to release Abeta peptides that likely play a causative role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, gamma-secretase cleaves Notch and other type I membrane proteins. gamma-Secretase inhibitors (GSIs) have been developed and used for clinical studies. However, clinical trials have shown adverse effects of GSIs that are potentially linked with nondiscriminatory inhibition of Notch signaling, overall APP processing, and other substrate cleavages. Therefore, these findings call for the development of disease-modifying agents that target gamma-secretase activity to lower levels of Abeta42 production without blocking the overall processing of gamma-secretase substrates. gamma-Secretase modulators (GSMs) originally derived from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) display such characteristics and are the focus of this review. However, first-generation GSMs have limited potential because of the low potency and undesired neuropharmacokinetic properties. This generation of GSMs has been suggested to interact with the APP substrate, gamma-secretase, or both. To improve the potency and brain availability, second-generation GSMs, including NSAID-derived carboxylic acid and non-NSAID-derived heterocyclic chemotypes, as well as natural product-derived GSMs have been developed. Animal studies of this generation of GSMs have shown encouraging preclinical profiles. Moreover, using potent GSM photoaffinity probes, multiple studies unambiguously have showed that both carboxylic acid and heterocyclic GSMs specifically target presenilin, the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase. In addition, two types of GSMs have distinct binding sites within the gamma-secretase complex and exhibit different Abeta profiles. GSMs induce a conformational change of gamma-secretase to achieve modulation. Various models are proposed and discussed. Despite the progress of GSM research, many outstanding issues remain to be investigated to achieve the ultimate goal of developing GSMs as effective AD therapies.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggests that soluble amyloid beta (Abeta) is an initiator of a cascade of events eventually leading to neurodegeneration. Recently, we reported that Abeta deranged Ca(2+) homeostasis specifically in hippocampal astrocytes by targeting key elements of Ca(2+) signaling, such as mGluR5 and IP3 R1. In the present study, we dissect a cascade of signaling events by which Abeta deregulates glial Ca(2+) : (i) 100 nM Abeta leads to an increase in cytosolic calcium after 4-6 h of treatment; (ii) mGluR5 is increased after 24 h of treatment; (iii) this increase is blocked by inhibitors of calcineurin (CaN) and NF-kB. Furthermore, we show that Abeta treatment of glial cells leads to de-phosphorylation of Bcl10 and an increased CaN-Bcl10 interaction. Last, mGluR5 staining is augmented in hippocampal astrocytes of AD patients in proximity of Abeta plaques and co-localizes with nuclear accumulation of the p65 NF-kB subunit and increased staining of CaNAalpha. Taken together our data suggest that nanomolar [Abeta] deregulates Ca(2+) homeostasis via CaN and its downstream target NF-kB, possibly via the cross-talk of Bcl10 in hippocampal astrocytes.",

    "title": "A novel nicotinic mechanism underlies beta-amyloid-induced neuronal hyperexcitation.",
    "abstract": "There is a significantly elevated incidence of epilepsy in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, there is neural hyperexcitation/synchronization in transgenic mice expressing abnormal levels or forms of amyloid precursor protein and its presumed, etiopathogenic product, amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta). However, the underlying mechanisms of how Abeta causes neuronal hyperexcitation remain unclear. Here, we report that exposure to pathologically relevant levels of Abeta induces Abeta form-dependent, concentration-dependent, and time-dependent neuronal hyperexcitation in primary cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons. Similarly, Abeta exposure increases levels of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) alpha7 subunit protein on the cell surface and alpha7-nAChR function, but not alpha7 subunit mRNA, suggesting post-translational upregulation of functional alpha7-nAChRs. These effects are prevented upon coexposure to brefeldin A, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi protein transport, consistent with an effect on trafficking of alpha7 subunits and assembled alpha7-nAChRs to the cell surface. Abeta exposure-induced alpha7-nAChR functional upregulation occurs before there is expression of neuronal hyperexcitation. Pharmacological inhibition using an alpha7-nAChR antagonist or genetic deletion of nAChR alpha7 subunits prevents induction and expression of neuronal hyperexcitation. Collectively, these results, confirmed in studies using slice cultures, indicate that functional activity and perhaps functional upregulation of alpha7-nAChRs are necessary for production of Abeta-induced neuronal hyperexcitation and possibly AD pathogenesis. This novel mechanism involving alpha7-nAChRs in mediation of Abeta effects provides potentially new therapeutic targets for treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an integral component of both neural toxicity and plaque formation. Brains of the longest-lived rodents, naked mole-rats (NMRs) approximately 32 years of age, had levels of Abeta similar to those of the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD. Interestingly, there was no evidence of extracellular plaques, nor was there an age-related increase in Abeta levels in the individuals examined (2-20+ years). The NMR Abeta peptide showed greater homology to the human sequence than to the mouse sequence, differing by only 1 amino acid from the former. This subtle difference led to interspecies differences in aggregation propensity but not neurotoxicity; NMR Abeta was less prone to aggregation than human Abeta. Nevertheless, both NMR and human Abeta were equally toxic to mouse hippocampal neurons, suggesting that Abeta neurotoxicity and aggregation properties were not coupled. Understanding how NMRs acquire and tolerate high levels of Abeta with no plaque formation could provide useful insights into AD, and may elucidate protective mechanisms that delay AD progression.",

    "abstract": "Animal models have been used for decades in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) research field and have been crucial for the advancement of our understanding of the disease. Most models are based on familial AD mutations of genes involved in the amyloidogenic process, such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1). Some models also incorporate mutations in tau (MAPT) known to cause frontotemporal dementia, a neurodegenerative disease that shares some elements of neuropathology with AD. While these models are complex, they fail to display pathology that perfectly recapitulates that of the human disease. Unfortunately, this level of pre-existing complexity creates a barrier to the further modification and improvement of these models. However, as the efficacy and safety of viral vectors improves, their use as an alternative to germline genetic modification is becoming a widely used research tool. In this review we discuss how this approach can be used to better utilize common mouse models in AD research. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Animal Models of Disease.",

These lipid raft-like regions of ER are referred to as mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs), and they play an important role in, for example, lipid synthesis, calcium homeostasis, and apoptotic signaling. Perturbation of MAM function has previously been suggested in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as shown in fibroblasts from AD patients and a neuroblastoma cell line containing familial presenilin-2 AD mutation. The effect of AD pathogenesis on the ER-mitochondria interplay in the brain has so far remained unknown. Here, we studied ER-mitochondria contacts in human AD brain and related AD mouse and neuronal cell models. We found uniform distribution of MAM in neurons. Phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein-2 and sigma1 receptor, two MAM-associated proteins, were shown to be essential for neuronal survival, because siRNA knockdown resulted in degeneration. Up-regulated MAM-associated proteins were found in the AD brain and amyloid precursor protein (APP)Swe/Lon mouse model, in which up-regulation was observed before the appearance of plaques. By studying an ER-mitochondria bridging complex, inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor-voltage-dependent anion channel, we revealed that nanomolar concentrations of amyloid beta-peptide increased inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor and voltage-dependent anion channel protein expression and elevated the number of ER-mitochondria contact points and mitochondrial calcium concentrations. Our data suggest an important role of ER-mitochondria contacts and cross-talk in AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "Neuropilin tolloid-like 1 (Neto1), is a CUB domain-containing transmembrane protein that was recently identified as a novel component of the NMDA receptor complex. Here, we have investigated the possible association of Neto1 with the amyloid precursor protein (APP)695/GluN1/GluN2A and APP695/GluN1/GluN2B NMDA receptor trafficking complexes that we have previously identified. Neto1(HA) was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with assembled NMDA receptors via GluN2A or GluN2B subunits; Neto1(HA) did not co-immunoprecipitate APP695(FLAG) . Co-immunoprecipitations from mammalian cells co-transfected with APP695(FLAG) , Neto1(HA) and GluN1/GluN2A or GluN1/GluN2B revealed that all four proteins co-exist within one macromolecular complex. Immunoprecipitations from native brain tissue similarly revealed the existence of a GluN1/GluN2A or GluN2B/APP/Neto1 complex. Neto1(HA) caused a reduction in the surface expression of both NMDA receptor subtypes, but had no effect on APP695(FLAG) - or PSD-95alpha(c-Myc) enhanced surface receptor expression. The Neto1 binding domain of GluN2A was mapped using GluN1/GluN2A chimeras and GluN2A truncation constructs. The extracellular GluN2A domain does not contribute to association with Neto1(HA) but deletion of the intracellular tail resulted in a loss of Neto-1(HA) co-immunoprecipitation which was paralleled by a loss of association between GluN2A and SAP102. Thus, Neto1 is concluded to be a component of APP/NMDA receptor trafficking complexes.",

To characterize molecular systems associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), we constructed gene-regulatory networks in 1,647 postmortem brain tissues from LOAD patients and nondemented subjects, and we demonstrate that LOAD reconfigures specific portions of the molecular interaction structure. Through an integrative network-based approach, we rank-ordered these network structures for relevance to LOAD pathology, highlighting an immune- and microglia-specific module that is dominated by genes involved in pathogen phagocytosis, contains TYROBP as a key regulator, and is upregulated in LOAD. Mouse microglia cells overexpressing intact or truncated TYROBP revealed expression changes that significantly overlapped the human brain TYROBP network. Thus the causal network structure is a useful predictor of response to gene perturbations and presents a framework to test models of disease mechanisms underlying LOAD.",

We have previously shown that the CD33 gene is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we observed increased expression of CD33 in microglial cells in AD brain. The minor allele of the CD33 SNP rs3865444, which confers protection against AD, was associated with reductions in both CD33 expression and insoluble amyloid beta 42 (Abeta42) levels in AD brain. Furthermore, the numbers of CD33-immunoreactive microglia were positively correlated with insoluble Abeta42 levels and plaque burden in AD brain. CD33 inhibited uptake and clearance of Abeta42 in microglial cell cultures. Finally, brain levels of insoluble Abeta42 as well as amyloid plaque burden were markedly reduced in APP(Swe)/PS1(DeltaE9)/CD33(-/-) mice. Therefore, CD33 inactivation mitigates Abeta pathology and CD33 inhibition could represent a novel therapy for AD.",

    "abstract": "Pathological accumulation of cortical amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is an early and consistent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta levels in the brain are determined by production and catabolism. Previous studies have suggested that deficits in the brain expression of neprilysin (NEP) and the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), which are both proteases involved in amyloid degradation, may promote Abeta deposition in patients with sporadic late-onset AD. Because the incidence of AD increases after surgical intervention, we examined whether ketamine, which is a general anaesthetic with neuroprotective properties for excitotoxic ischaemic damage, is associated with Abeta degradation by inducing NEP and IDE expression. The non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine and MK801 significantly decreased the expression of NEP, but not IDE, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner through the dephosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in cultured rat astrocytes. Furthermore, NEP-reduced reagents significantly suppressed the degradation of exogenous Abeta in cultured astrocytes. These results suggested that ketamine suppresses the Abeta degradation of NEP by reducing p38 MAPK-mediated pathway activity.",

    "abstract": "The inflammatory process in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been suggested to include oxidative and nitrosative damage caused by elevated levels of nitric oxide (NO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Here, we investigated iNOS expression in cortical neurons following amyloid-beta (Abeta) treatment, vitamin D treatment, Abeta combined with vitamin D treatment, and vitamin D signaling disruption via silencing of nuclear (vitamin D receptor-VDR) or membrane vitamin D (1,25-MARRS) receptors. We observed that Abeta induced iNOS expression. Vitamin D prevented Abeta-induced cytotoxicity and iNOS upregulation in cortical neurons. Our silencing experiments suggest that vitamin D regulates iNOS via VDR, not 1,25-MARRS, in cortical neurons. Consequently, VDR absence induces iNOS expression in either the absence or presence of Abeta. While our previous work demonstrates that Abeta pathology includes VDR suppression, our present work demonstrates that Abeta induces iNOS and that this effect is mediated via disruption of the vitamin D-VDR pathway. These data suggest the existence of crosstalk between Abeta pathology and VDR. Thus, vitamin D supplementation should be considered a candidate in both the treatment and prevention of AD.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation (CAA-ri) is characterized by vasogenic edema and multiple cortical/subcortical microbleeds, sharing several aspects with the recently defined amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) passive immunization therapies. Herein, we investigated the role of anti-amyloid beta (Abeta) autoantibodies in the acute and remission phases of CAA-ri. METHODS: We used a novel ultrasensitive technique on patients from a retrospective multicenter case-control study, and evaluated the anti-Abeta autoantibody concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 10 CAA-ri, 8 CAA, 14 multiple sclerosis, and 25 control subjects. Levels of soluble Abeta40, Abeta42, tau, P-181 tau, and APOE genotype were also investigated. RESULTS: During the acute phase of CAA-ri, anti-Abeta autoantibodies were specifically increased and directly correlated with Abeta mobilization, together with augmented tau and P-181 tau. Following clinical and radiological remission, autoantibodies progressively returned to control levels, and both soluble Abeta and axonal degeneration markers decreased in parallel. INTERPRETATION: Our data support the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of CAA-ri may be mediated by a selective autoimmune reaction against cerebrovascular Abeta, directly related to autoantibody concentration and soluble Abeta. The CSF dosage of anti-Abeta autoantibodies with the technique here described can thus be proposed as a valid alternative tool for the diagnosis of CAA-ri. Moreover, given the similarities between ARIA developing spontaneously and those observed during immunization trials, anti-Abeta autoantibodies can be considered as novel potential biomarkers in future amyloid-modifying therapies for the treatment of AD and CAA.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disease with no cure. A potential therapeutic approach is to prevent or reverse the amyloid formation of Abeta42, a key pathological hallmark of AD. We examine the molecular basis for stereochemistry-dependent inhibition of the formation of Abeta fibrils in vitro by a polyol, scyllo-inositol. We present molecular dynamics simulations of the monomeric, disordered aggregate, and protofibrillar states of Abeta(16-22), an amyloid-forming peptide fragment of full-length Abeta, successively with and without scyllo-inositol and its inactive stereoisomer chiro-inositol. Both stereoisomers bind monomers and disordered aggregates with similar affinities of 10-120 mM, whereas binding to beta-sheet-containing protofibrils yields affinities of 0.2-0.5 mM commensurate with in vitro inhibitory concentrations of scyllo-inositol. Moreover, scyllo-inositol displays a higher binding specificity for phenylalanine-lined grooves on the protofibril surface, suggesting that scyllo-inositol coats the surface of Abeta protofibrils and disrupts their lateral stacking into amyloid fibrils.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid fibrils formed by the 40-residue beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta(1-40)) are highly polymorphic, with molecular structures that depend on the details of growth conditions. Underlying differences in physical properties are not well understood. Here, we investigate differences in growth kinetics and thermodynamic stabilities of two Abeta(1-40) fibril polymorphs for which detailed structural models are available from solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies. Rates of seeded fibril elongation in the presence of excess soluble Abeta(1-40) and shrinkage in the absence of soluble Abeta(1-40) are determined with atomic force microscopy (AFM). From these rates, we derive polymorph-specific values for the soluble Abeta(1-40) concentration at quasi-equilibrium, from which relative stabilities can be derived. The AFM results are supported by direct measurements by ultraviolet absorbance, using a novel dialysis system to establish quasi-equilibrium. At 24  C, the two polymorphs have significantly different elongation and shrinkage kinetics but similar thermodynamic stabilities. At 37  C, differences in kinetics are reduced, and thermodynamic stabilities are increased significantly. Fibril length distributions in AFM images provide support for an intermittent growth model, in which fibrils switch randomly between an \"on\" state (capable of elongation) and an \"off\" state (incapable of elongation). We also monitor interconversion between polymorphs at 24  C by solid-state NMR, showing that the two-fold symmetric \"agitated\" (A) polymorph is more stable than the three-fold symmetric \"quiescent\" (Q) polymorph. Finally, we show that the two polymorphs have significantly different rates of fragmentation in the presence of shear forces, a difference that helps explain the observed predominance of the A structure when fibrils are grown in agitated solutions.",

    "abstract": "The \"amyloid-beta (Abeta) hypothesis\" posits that accumulating Abeta peptides (Abetas) produced by neurons cause Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the Abetas contribution by the more numerous astrocytes remains undetermined. Previously we showed that fibrillar (f)Abeta25-35, an Abeta42 proxy, evokes a surplus endogenous Abeta42 production/accumulation in cortical adult human astrocytes. Here, by using immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, enzymatic assays, and highly sensitive sandwich ELISA kits, we investigated the effects of fAbeta25-35 and soluble (s)Abeta25-35 on Abeta42 and Abeta40 accumulation/secretion by human cortical astrocytes and HCN-1A neurons and, since the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) binds Abetas, their modulation by NPS 2143, a CaSR allosteric antagonist (calcilytic). The fAbeta25-35-exposed astrocytes and surviving neurons produced, accumulated, and secreted increased amounts of Abeta42, while Abeta40 also accrued but its secretion was unchanged. Accordingly, secreted Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio values rose for astrocytes and neurons. While slightly enhancing Abeta40 secretion by fAbeta25-35-treated astrocytes, NPS 2143 specifically suppressed the fAbeta25-35-elicited surges of endogenous Abeta42 secretion by astrocytes and neurons. Therefore, NPS 2143 addition always kept Abeta42/Abeta40 values to baseline or lower levels. Mechanistically, NPS 2143 decreased total CaSR protein complement, transiently raised proteasomal chymotrypsin activity, and blocked excess NO production without affecting the ongoing increases in BACE1/beta-secretase and gamma-secretase activity in fAbeta25-35-treated astrocytes. Compared to fAbeta25-35, sAbeta25-35 also stimulated Abeta42 secretion by astrocytes and neurons and NPS 2143 specifically and wholly suppressed this effect. Therefore, since NPS 2143 thwarts any Abeta/CaSR-induced surplus secretion of endogenous Abeta42 and hence further vicious cycles of Abeta self-induction/secretion/spreading, calcilytics might effectively prevent/stop the progression to full-blown AD.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the relationship of greater adherence to Mediterranean diet (MeD) and likelihood of incident cognitive impairment (ICI) and evaluate the interaction of race and vascular risk factors. METHODS: A prospective, population-based, cohort of individuals enrolled in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study 2003-2007, excluding participants with history of stroke, impaired cognitive status at baseline, and missing data on Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQ), was evaluated. Adherence to a MeD (scored as 0-9) was computed from FFQ. Cognitive status was evaluated at baseline and annually during a mean follow-up period of 4.0 +- 1.5 years using Six-item-Screener. RESULTS: ICI was identified in 1,248 (7%) out of 17,478 individuals fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Higher adherence to MeD was associated with lower likelihood of ICI before (odds ratio [lsqb]OR[rsqb] 0.89; 95% confidence interval [lsqb]CI[rsqb] 0.79-1.00) and after adjustment for potential confounders (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.76-1.00) including demographic characteristics, environmental factors, vascular risk factors, depressive symptoms, and self-reported health status. There was no interaction between race (p = 0.2928) and association of adherence to MeD with cognitive status. However, we identified a strong interaction of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.0134) on the relationship of adherence to MeD with ICI; high adherence to MeD was associated with a lower likelihood of ICI in nondiabetic participants (OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.70-0.94; p = 0.0066) but not in diabetic individuals (OR 1.27; 95% CI 0.95-1.71; p = 0.1063). CONCLUSIONS: Higher adherence to MeD was associated with a lower likelihood of ICI independent of potential confounders. This association was moderated by presence of diabetes mellitus.",

    "abstract": "Dementia is a global epidemic with Alzheimer's disease (AD) being the leading cause. Early identification of patients at risk of developing AD is now becoming an international priority. Neocortical Abeta (extracellular beta-amyloid) burden (NAB), as assessed by positron emission tomography (PET), represents one such marker for early identification. These scans are expensive and are not widely available, thus, there is a need for cheaper and more widely accessible alternatives. Addressing this need, a blood biomarker-based signature having efficacy for the prediction of NAB and which can be easily adapted for population screening is described. Blood data (176 analytes measured in plasma) and Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET measurements from 273 participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study were utilised. Univariate analysis was conducted to assess the difference of plasma measures between high and low NAB groups, and cross-validated machine-learning models were generated for predicting NAB. These models were applied to 817 non-imaged AIBL subjects and 82 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) for validation. Five analytes showed significant difference between subjects with high compared to low NAB. A machine-learning model (based on nine markers) achieved sensitivity and specificity of 80 and 82%, respectively, for predicting NAB. Validation using the ADNI cohort yielded similar results (sensitivity 79% and specificity 76%). These results show that a panel of blood-based biomarkers is able to accurately predict NAB, supporting the hypothesis for a relationship between a blood-based signature and Abeta accumulation, therefore, providing a platform for developing a population-based screen.",

A number of studies have been undertaken to develop GSK-3 inhibitors for clinical use. We report two novel GSK-3 inhibitors (C-7a and C-7b) showing good activity and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. IC50 of new GSK-3 inhibitors were in the range of 120-130 nM, and they effectively reduced the Abeta-oligomers induced neuronal toxicity. Also, new GSK-3 inhibitors decreased the phosphorylated tau at pThr231, pSer396, pThr181, and pSer202, and inhibited the GSK-3 activity against Abeta-oligomers induced neuronal cell toxicity. In B6;129-Psen1(tm1Mpm) Tg(APPSwe, tauP301L)1Lfa/Mmjax model of AD, oral administration of C-7a (20 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg) showed increased total arm entries and spontaneous alteration of Y-maze which was regarded as short-term memory.

    "abstract": "Stacking of beta-sheets results in a protein super secondary structure with remarkable mechanical properties. beta-Stacks are the determinants of a silk fiber's resilience and are also the building blocks of amyloid fibrils. While both silk and amyloid-type crystals are known to feature a high resistance against rupture, their structural and mechanical similarities and particularities are yet to be fully understood. Here, we systematically compare the rupture force and stiffness of amyloid and spider silk poly-alanine beta-stacks of comparable sizes using Molecular Dynamics simulations. We identify the direction of force application as the primary determinant of the rupture strength; beta-sheets in silk are orientated along the fiber axis, i.e. the pulling direction, and consequently require high forces in the several nanoNewton range for shearing beta-strands apart, while beta-sheets in amyloid are oriented vertically to the fiber, allowing a zipper-like rupture at sub-nanoNewton forces. A secondary factor rendering amyloid beta-stacks softer and weaker than their spider silk counterparts is the sub-optimal side-chain packing between beta-sheets due to the sequence variations of amyloid-forming proteins as opposed to the perfectly packed poly-alanine beta-sheets of silk. Taken together, amyloid fibers can reach the stiffness of silk fibers in spite of their softer and weaker beta-sheet arrangement as they are missing a softening amorphous matrix.",

    "abstract": "Validation of cost-effective, non-invasive methods to identify early (pre-clinical) Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly becoming a key research challenge. We have developed two ELISA sandwich colorimetric tests for the accurate detection of amyloid-beta (Abeta)1-40 and Abeta1-42: i) directly accessible (DA) in the plasma, ii) recovered from the plasma sample (RP) after diluting the plasma sample in a formulated buffer, and iii) associated with the remaining cellular pellet (CP). These tests were carried out on samples from healthy controls (n = 19) and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 27) with amnestic-hippocampal syndrome to investigate whether this comprehensive approach may help to explain the association between blood Abeta levels and MCI. A logistic regression analysis detected seven direct or calculated markers (CP 40, DA 42, RP 42, DA/CP 40, DA/RP 42, DA/CP 42, and DA 42/40) with significant odds ratios (OR) after they were dichotomized with regard to the median of the pooled population. In particular, the likelihood [OR (95% CI)] of having MCI for patients with catCP 40, catDA/RP 42, catDA/CP 42, or catDA 42/40 below the corresponding population median (\"positive test\") was 11.48 (1.87-70.52), 22.09 (3.19-152.61), 11.48 (1.87-70.50), and 9.54 (1.77-51.38)-fold higher, respectively, than in those with a \"negative test\" after adjusting for the effect of the ApoE genotype. These results are congruent with the hypothesis that changes in blood Abeta levels may be associated with the initial stages of AD. Thus, these Abeta blood biomarkers might be useful tools for screening for those at increased risk of developing AD.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: Alterations of plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides have been related to a high risk for cognitive impairment and dementia. The present study aimed to measure plasma Abeta peptides (Abeta40, Abeta42) and the Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio in a sample of drug-resistant bipolar depressed patients, as well as to explore the possible correlation between biological parameters and clinical changes along an electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) course. METHODS: Abeta40 and Abeta42 were measured by means of an ELISA assay in 25 drug-resistant bipolar depressed patients before (T0) and 1 week after (T1) the end of ECT. The patients were clinically evaluated by means of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, 21-item (HRSD-21), the Mini-Mental State Examination, and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness Scale. RESULTS: Plasma Abeta levels and the Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio were similar at T0 and T1. The Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio correlated positively with the HRSD total score at both T0 and T1. At T0, a negative correlation was found between the Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio and the improvement of depressive and cognitive symptoms. Moreover, remitters (n = 9; HRSD <=10) showed a significantly lower Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio at T0 than nonremitters. CONCLUSION: The present data suggest that a low Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio might characterize a subgroup of depressed patients who respond to ECT, while higher values of this parameter seem to be typical of more severe cases of patients with cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Because Congo red (CR) can bind to critical intermediate structural forms of amyloid beta (Abeta), it has been suggested as a potential therapeutic agent against neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. In this study, the interaction of CR with Abeta(12-28) was investigated by use of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Studies conducted between 15 and 35  C show that binding of CR to Abeta(12-28) was strongly dependent on temperature, with a decrease in CR-Abeta(12-28) complexation as temperature increases, presumably because of conformational changes within Abeta(12-28) at the highest temperatures, that conceal the CR binding sites. In fact, no CR binding was observed at 35  C. The binding of CR to Abeta(12-28) was associated with favorable changes in both enthalpy and entropy that resulted in binding constants (K) of between 10(5) and 10(6) M (-1). An early (and more intense) entropy-driven CR disaggregation phase (K ~10(7)-10(8) M (-1)) was observed before the onset of CR-Abeta(12-28) complexation. Only CR disaggregation was observed at 35  C. These results may provide further insights into the ability of CR to inhibit Abeta toxicity in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "title": "Dual cleavage of neuregulin 1 type III by BACE1 and ADAM17 liberates its EGF-like domain and allows paracrine signaling.",
    "abstract": "Proteolytic shedding of cell surface proteins generates paracrine signals involved in numerous signaling pathways. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) type III is involved in myelination of the peripheral nervous system, for which it requires proteolytic activation by proteases of the ADAM family and BACE1. These proteases are major therapeutic targets for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease because they are also involved in the proteolytic generation of the neurotoxic amyloid beta-peptide. Identification and functional investigation of their physiological substrates is therefore of greatest importance in preventing unwanted side effects. Here we investigated proteolytic processing of NRG1 type III and demonstrate that the ectodomain can be cleaved by three different sheddases, namely ADAM10, ADAM17, and BACE1. Surprisingly, we not only found cleavage by ADAM10, ADAM17, and BACE1 C-terminal to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, which is believed to play a pivotal role in signaling, but also additional cleavage sites for ADAM17 and BACE1 N-terminal to that domain. Proteolytic processing at N- and C-terminal sites of the EGF-like domain results in the secretion of this domain from NRG1 type III. The soluble EGF-like domain is functionally active and stimulates ErbB3 signaling in tissue culture assays. Moreover, the soluble EGF-like domain is capable of rescuing hypomyelination in a zebrafish mutant lacking BACE1. Our data suggest that NRG1 type III-dependent myelination is not only controlled by membrane-retained NRG1 type III, but also in a paracrine manner via proteolytic liberation of the EGF-like domain.",

After the characterization of cognitive deficits in these mice, assessment of spatial learning and memory functions revealed that treatment with tolfenamic acid attenuated long-term memory and working memory deficits, determined using Morris water maze and the Y-maze. These improvements occurred within a shorter period of exposure than that seen with clinically approved drugs. Cognitive enhancement was accompanied by reduction in the levels of the SP1 protein (but not messenger RNA [mRNA]), followed by lowering both the mRNA and the protein levels of APP and subsequent Abeta levels.

Three-month-old mice overexpressing mutated forms of amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 under the control of a neuron-specific promoter received an injection of adeno-associated virus encoding the neuronal isoform of full-length L1 (AAV-L1) or, as negative control, green fluorescent protein (AAV-GFP) into the hippocampus and occipital cortex. Four months after virus injection, the mice were analyzed for histological and biochemical parameters of AD. AAV-L1 injection decreased the Abeta plaque load, levels of Abeta42, Abeta42/40 ratio and astrogliosis compared with AAV-GFP controls. AAV-L1 injected mice also had increased densities of inhibitory synaptic terminals on pyramidal cells in the hippocampus when compared with AAV-GFP controls. Numbers of microglial cells/macrophages were similar in both groups, but numbers of microglial cells/macrophages per plaque were increased in AAV-L1 injected mice. To probe for a molecular mechanism that may underlie these effects, we analyzed whether L1 would directly and specifically interact with Abeta. In a label-free binding assay, concentration dependent binding of the extracellular domain of L1, but not of the close homolog of L1 to Abeta40 and Abeta42 was seen, with the fibronectin type III homologous repeats 1-3 of L1 mediating this effect. Aggregation of Abeta42 in vitro was reduced in the presence of the extracellular domain of L1. The combined observations indicate that L1, when overexpressed in neurons and glia, reduces several histopathological hallmarks of AD in mice, possibly by reduction of Abeta aggregation. L1 thus appears to be a candidate molecule to ameliorate the pathology of AD, when applied in therapeutically viable treatment schemes.",

    "abstract": "As nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists directly address cholinergic neurotransmission with potential impact on glutamatergic function, they are considered as potential new symptomatic treatment options for Alzheimer's disease compared to the indirectly operating acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as the current gold standard donepezil. In order to evaluate the therapeutic value of nAChR activation to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction, a direct comparison between alpha4beta2, alpha7 nAChR agonists, and donepezil was performed on the level of an ex vivo experimental model of impaired memory formation. First, we demonstrated that amyloid beta (Abeta)42 oligomers, which are believed to be the synaptotoxic Abeta-species causally involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, have a detrimental effect on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices, a widely used cellular model of learning and memory. Second, we investigated the potential of donepezil, the alpha4beta2 nAChR agonist TC-1827 and the alpha7 nAChR partial agonist SSR180711 to reverse Abeta42 oligomer induced LTP impairment. Donepezil showed only a slight reversal of Abeta42 oligomer induced impairment of early LTP, and had no effect on Abeta42 oligomer induced impairment of late LTP. The same was demonstrated for the alpha4beta2 nAChR agonist TC-1827. In contrast, the alpha7 nAChR partial agonist SSR180711 completely rescued early as well as late LTP impaired by Abeta42 oligomers. As activating alpha7 nAChRs was found to be most efficacious in restoring Abeta42 oligomer induced LTP deficits, targeting alpha7 nAChRs might represent a powerful alternative approach for symptomatic treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing body of evidence that soluble oligomeric forms of amyloid beta (Abeta) play a critical role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the importance of soluble Abeta oligomers as a therapeutic target for AD, the dynamic metabolism of these Abeta species in vivo has not been elucidated because of the difficulty in monitoring brain Abeta oligomers in living animals. Here, using a unique large pore-sized membrane microdialysis, we characterized soluble Abeta oligomers in brain interstitial fluid (ISF) of awake, freely moving APP/PS1 transgenic and control WT mice. We could detect high-molecular-weight (HMW) and low-molecular-weight (LMW) Abeta oligomers in the brain ISF of living animals, which increased dramatically in an age-dependent manner (5- to 8-fold increase, 4 vs. 17-18 mo). Notably, HMW Abeta decreased more slowly than other forms of Abeta after acute gamma-secretase inhibition [% decrease from the baseline (HMW vs. LMW) was 36.9 vs. 74.1% (Abeta40, P<0.05) and 25.4 vs. 88.0% (Abeta42, P<0.01)], suggesting that HMW Abeta oligomers clear more slowly than other forms from the brain. These data reveal the dynamic metabolism of neurotoxic Abeta oligomers in AD brain and could provide new insights into Abeta-targeted therapies for AD.",

Our simulation results indicated that the stable Abeta40 monomer was a random coil, while the oligomer structures became more fibril-like with the increase of the peptide strands.

    "abstract": "AIMS: Cells have developed quality control systems for protection against proteotoxicity. Misfolded and aggregation-prone proteins, which are behind the initiation and progression of many neurodegenerative diseases (ND), are known to challenge the proteostasis network of the cells. We aimed to explore the role of DNJ-27/ERdj5, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident thioredoxin protein required as a disulfide reductase for the degradation of misfolded proteins, in well-established Caenorhabditis elegans models of Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington diseases. RESULTS: We demonstrate that DNJ-27 is an ER luminal protein and that its expression is induced upon ER stress via IRE-1/XBP-1. When dnj-27 expression is downregulated by RNA interference we find an increase in the aggregation and associated pathological phenotypes (paralysis and motility impairment) caused by human beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta), alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) and polyglutamine (polyQ) proteins. In turn, DNJ-27 overexpression ameliorates these deleterious phenotypes. Surprisingly, despite being an ER-resident protein, we show that dnj-27 downregulation alters cytoplasmic protein homeostasis and causes mitochondrial fragmentation. We further demonstrate that DNJ-27 overexpression substantially protects against the mitochondrial fragmentation caused by human Abeta and alpha-syn peptides in these worm models. INNOVATION: We identify C. elegans dnj-27 as a novel protective gene for the toxicity associated with the expression of human Abeta, alpha-syn and polyQ proteins, implying a protective role of ERdj5 in Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington diseases. CONCLUSION: Our data support a scenario where the levels of DNJ-27/ERdj5 in the ER impact cytoplasmic protein homeostasis and the integrity of the mitochondrial network which might underlie its protective effects in models of proteotoxicity associated to human ND.",

Here, we combined Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize the misfolding process of an Abeta peptide. Dynamic force spectroscopy AFM analysis showed that the peptide forms stable dimers with a lifetime of ~1 s. During MD simulations, isolated monomers gradually adopt essentially similar nonstructured conformations independent from the initial structure. However, when two monomers approach their structure changes dramatically, and the conformational space for the two monomers become restricted. The arrangement of monomers in antiparallel orientation leads to the cooperative formation of beta-sheet conformation. Interactions, including hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and weakly polar interactions of side chains stabilize the structure of the dimer. Under the applied force, the dimer, as during the AFM experiments, dissociates in a cooperative manner. Thus, misfolding of the Abeta peptide proceeds via the loss of conformational flexibility and formation of stable dimers suggesting their key role in the subsequent Abeta aggregation process.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampus volumetry currently is the best-established imaging biomarker for AD. However, the effect of multicenter acquisition on measurements of hippocampus volume needs to be explicitly considered when it is applied in large clinical trials, for example by using mixed-effects models to take the clustering of data within centers into account. The marker needs further validation in respect of the underlying neurobiological substrate and potential confounds such as vascular disease, inflammation, hydrocephalus, and alcoholism, and with regard to clinical outcomes such as cognition but also to demographic and socioeconomic outcomes such as mortality and institutionalization. The use of hippocampus volumetry for risk stratification of predementia study samples will further increase with the availability of automated measurement approaches. An important step in this respect will be the development of a standard hippocampus tracing protocol that harmonizes the large range of presently available manual protocols. In the near future, regionally differentiated automated methods will become available together with an appropriate statistical model, such as multivariate analysis of deformation fields, or techniques such as cortical-thickness measurements that yield a meaningful metrics for the detection of treatment effects. More advanced imaging protocols, including DTI, DSI, and functional MRI, are presently being used in monocenter and first multicenter studies. In the future these techniques will be relevant for the risk stratification in phase IIa type studies (small proof-of-concept trials). By contrast, the application of the broader established structural imaging biomarkers, such as hippocampus volume, for risk stratification and as surrogate end point is already today part of many clinical trial protocols. However, clinical care will also be affected by these new technologies. Radiologic expert centers already offer \"dementia screening\" for well-off middle-aged people who undergo an MRI scan with subsequent automated, typically VBM-based analysis, and determination of z-score deviation from a matched control cohort. Next-generation scanner software will likely include radiologic expert systems for automated segmentation, deformation-based morphometry, and multivariate analysis of anatomic MRI scans for the detection of a typical AD pattern. As these developments will start to change medical practice, first for selected subject groups that can afford this type of screening but later eventually also for other cohorts, clinicians must become aware of the potentials and limitations of these technologies. It is decidedly unclear to date how a middle-aged cognitively intact subject with a seemingly AD-positive MRI scan should be clinically advised. There is no evidence for individual risk prediction and even less for specific treatments. Thus, the development of preclinical diagnostic imaging poses not only technical but also ethical problems that must be critically discussed on the basis of profound knowledge. From a neurobiological point of view, the main determinants of cognitive impairment in AD are the density of synapses and neurons in distributed cortical and subcortical networks. MRI-based measures of regional gray matter volume and associated multivariate analysis techniques of regional interactions of gray matter densities provide insight into the onset and temporal dynamics of cortical atrophy as a close proxy for regional neuronal loss and a basis of functional impairment in specific neuronal networks. From the clinical point of view, clinicians must bear in mind that patients do not suffer from hippocampus atrophy or disconnection but from memory impairment, and that dementia screening in asymptomatic subjects should not be used outside of clinical studies.",

The diagnosis should, therefore, be implemented in the clinical stage of the disease, relying on the essence of the new IWG diagnostic criteria in the recognition of this dual aspect of AD: a specific clinical presentation that is related to a well-defined underlying pathology. Biomarkers measured by PET or CSF correlate with high sensitivity and specificity with AD pathologic features; episodic memory properly measured also presents high specificity to detect patients who develop AD dementia, and clinical studies have demonstrated that these criteria applied in a clinical setting present good specificity, making feasible a diagnosis in the prodromal stage of the disease. From an ethical perspective, the governing principle for early prodromal diagnosis should be autonomy, because the decision of wishing to know or not to know should be performed individually by a competent individual. Furthermore, the potential benefit of an early diagnosis may be mediated through an autonomous decision.",

METHODS: New Jersey Medicaid claims data (1997-2009) were used retrospectively to study the effect of treatment on time to institutionalization. Observed Medicaid payments were used to calculate savings from delayed institutionalization, adjusting for cost offsets resulting from concurrent changes in use of other medical services. RESULTS: Initiation of existing therapies at earliest symptomatic onset is predicted to delay institutionalization by 91 days, reducing Medicaid costs by $19,108/institutionalized patient. Incorporating an 18.5% cost offset from increased use of other medical services as well as drug costs associated with earlier treatment results in net savings of $12,687/patient. Projected annual Medicaid savings exceed $1 billion. CONCLUSION: Earlier treatment leads to a small delay in institutionalization among AD patients, resulting in significant costs savings to Medicaid.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been applied to characterize the pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a mouse model, although little is known about whether these features are structure specific. Voxel-based analysis (VBA) and atlas-based analysis (ABA) are good complementary tools for whole-brain DTI analysis. The purpose of this study was to identify the spatial localization of disease-related pathology in an AD mouse model. METHODS: VBA and ABA quantification were used for the whole-brain DTI analysis of nine APP/PS1 mice and wild-type (WT) controls. Multiple scalar measurements, including fractional anisotropy (FA), trace, axial diffusivity (DA), and radial diffusivity (DR), were investigated to capture the various types of pathology. The accuracy of the image transformation applied for VBA and ABA was evaluated by comparing manual and atlas-based structure delineation using kappa statistics. Following the MR examination, the brains of the animals were analyzed for microscopy. RESULTS: Extensive anatomical alterations were identified in APP/PS1 mice, in both the gray matter areas (neocortex, hippocampus, caudate putamen, thalamus, hypothalamus, claustrum, amygdala, and piriform cortex) and the white matter areas (corpus callosum/external capsule, cingulum, septum, internal capsule, fimbria, and optic tract), evidenced by an increase in FA or DA, or both, compared to WT mice (p < 0.05, corrected). The average kappa value between manual and atlas-based structure delineation was approximately 0.8, and there was no significant difference between APP/PS1 and WT mice (p > 0.05). The histopathological changes in the gray matter areas were confirmed by microscopy studies. DTI did, however, demonstrate significant changes in white matter areas, where the difference was not apparent by qualitative observation of a single-slice histological specimen. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the structure-specific nature of pathological changes in APP/PS1 mouse, and also showed the feasibility of applying whole-brain analysis methods to the investigation of an AD mouse model.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) as perivascular deposits and senile plaques in the brain. The intake of the polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been associated with decreased amyloid deposition and reduced risk in AD in several epidemiological trials; however the exact underlying molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. The aim of the study was to test whether DHA can exert a direct protective effect on the elements of the neurovascular unit, such as neurons, glial cells, brain endothelial cells, and pericytes, treated with Abeta42 (15 muM). A dose-dependent high cellular toxicity was found in viability assays in all cell types and on acute hippocampal slices after treatment with Abeta42 small oligomers prepared in situ from an isopeptide precursor. The cell morphology also changed dramatically in all cell types. In brain endothelial cells, damaged barrier function and increased para- and transcellular permeability were observed after peptide treatment. The production of reactive oxygen species was elevated in pericytes and endothelial and glial cells. DHA (30 muM) significantly decreased the Abeta42-induced toxic effects in all cell types measured by viability assays, and protected the barrier integrity and functions of brain endothelial cells. DHA also decreased the elevated rhodamine 123 accumulation in brain endothelial cells pre-treated with Abeta42 indicating an effect on efflux pump activity. These results indicate for the first time that DHA can protect not only neurons but also the other elements of the neurovascular unit from the toxic effects of Abeta42 and this effect may be beneficial in AD.",

These age-related neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Attenuation of these pathological factors in AD, in addition to amyloid fibrils and neurofibrillary tangles, is critical to prevent cognitive impairment. The effects of PN401 treatment were tested in the Tg2576 and Tg2576 X P301L (TAPP) mouse models of AD. Treatment with PN401 reduced impairments in the Tg2576 mice in contextual fear conditioning and novel object recognition. In the TAPP mice, PN401 reduced the impairments in novel object recognition and social transmission of food preference. PN401 also improved motor behavior and reduced anxiety-like behavior in the TAPP mice. TAPP mouse hippocampal tau phosphorylation and lipid peroxidation were reduced by PN401 treatment. Increased tau phosphorylation was significantly correlated with worsening novel object recognition memory. PN401 did not affect amyloid plaque area in the AD mice. In other AD-related animal studies, PN401 treatment reduced blood-brain barrier damage due to intracortical LPS, elevation of serum TNFalpha due to systemic LPS, and hippocampal CA1 neuronal loss in the gerbil stroke model. Uridine dose-dependently protected cells from chemical hypoxia and ceramide, and decreased formation of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial DNA damage due to hydrogen peroxide. These protective effects were achieved by raising uridine levels to at least 25-50 muM and serum uridine levels in this range in humans were obtained with oral PN401.",

Several amyloid imaging probes with purported specificity for amyloid-beta plaques are currently at various stages of FDA approval. However, a number of factors appear to preclude these probes from clinical utilization. As the available \"amyloid specific\" positron emission tomography imaging probes have failed to demonstrate diagnostic value and have shown limited utility for monitoring therapeutic interventions in humans, a debate on their significance has emerged. The aim of this review is to identify and discuss critically the scientific issues contributing to the extensive inconsistencies reported in the literature on their purported in vivo amyloid specificity and potential utilization in patients.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Family studies of centenarians and long-lived persons have found substantial familial aggregation of survival to extreme ages; however, the extent to which such familial longevity is characterized by cognitively intact survival is not established. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether families with exceptional longevity are protected against cognitive impairment consistent with Alzheimer disease. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: Multisite study in New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1870 individuals (1510 family members and 360 spouse controls) recruited through the Long Life Family Study. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Prevalence of cognitive impairment based on a diagnostic algorithm validated using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center data set. RESULTS: The cognitive algorithm classified 546 individuals (38.5%) as having cognitive impairment consistent with Alzheimer disease. Long Life Family Study probands had a slightly but not statistically significant reduced risk of cognitive impairment compared with spouse controls (121 of 232 for probands vs 45 of 103 for spouse controls; odds ratio = 0.7; 95% CI, 0.4-1.4), whereas Long Life Family Study sons and daughters had a clearly reduced risk of cognitive impairment (11 of 213 for sons and daughters vs 28 of 216 for spouse controls; odds ratio = 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9). Restriction to nieces and nephews in the offspring generation attenuated this effect (37 of 328 for nieces and nephews vs 28 of 216 for spouse controls; odds ratio = 0.8; 95% CI, 0.4-1.4). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Rates of cognitive impairment characteristic of Alzheimer disease were relatively high. In the proband generation, rates were comparable across family members and spouse controls, whereas sons and daughters of probands had significantly lower rates than spouse controls. Results suggest a delayed onset of cognitive impairment in families with exceptional longevity, but assessment of age-specific incidence rates is required to confirm this hypothesis.",

Curcumin has been shown to reduce astrocyte reactivity, though the exact pathways underlying these effects are incompletely understood. Here we investigated the role of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugation in mediating this effect of curcumin. In beta-amyloid (Abeta)-treated astrocytes, morphological changes and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) confirmed reactivity, which was accompanied by c-jun N-terminal kinase activation. Moreover, the levels of SUMO-1 conjugated proteins, as well as the conjugating enzyme, Ubc9, were decreased, with concomitant treatment with curcumin preventing these effects. Increasing SUMOylation in astrocytes, by over-expression of constitutively active SUMO-1, but not its inactive mutant, abrogated Abeta-induced increase in GFAP, suggesting astrocytes require SUMO-1 conjugation to remain non-reactive.",

One-year brain changes with a distinct frontotemporal pattern have been shown in older adults. However, it is not clear to what extent these changes may have been affected by undetected, early AD. To address this, we estimated 1-year atrophy by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 132 healthy elderly persons who had remained free of diagnosed mild cognitive impairment or AD for at least 3 years. We found significant volumetric reductions throughout the brain. The sample was further divided into low-risk groups based on clinical, biomarker, genetic, or cognitive criteria. Although sample sizes varied, significant reductions were observed in all groups, with rates and topographical distribution of atrophy comparable to that of the full sample. Volume reductions were especially pronounced in the default mode network, closely matching the previously described frontotemporal pattern of changes in healthy aging. Atrophy in the hippocampus predicted change in memory, with no additional default mode network contributions. In conclusion, reductions in regional brain volumes can be detected over the course of 1 year even in older adults who are unlikely to be in a presymptomatic stage of AD.",

    "abstract": "Profound synapse loss is one of the major pathological hallmarks associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and might underlie memory impairment. Our previous work demonstrated that the magnesium ion is a critical factor in controlling synapse density/plasticity. Here, we investigated whether elevation of brain magnesium by the use of a recently developed compound, magnesium-l-threonate (MgT), can ameliorate the AD-like pathologies and cognitive deficits in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, a transgenic (Tg) mouse model of AD. MgT treatment reduced Abeta plaque and prevented synapse loss and memory decline in the Tg mice. Strikingly, MgT treatment was effective even when given to the mice at the end stage of their AD-like pathological progression. To explore how elevation of brain magnesium ameliorates the AD-like pathologies in the brains of Tg mice, we studied molecules critical for APP metabolism and signaling pathways implicated in synaptic plasticity/density. In the Tg mice, the NMDAR/CREB/BDNF signaling was downregulated, whereas calpain/calcineurin/Cdk5 neurodegenerative signaling and beta-secretase (BACE1) expression were upregulated. MgT treatment prevented the impairment of these signaling pathways, stabilized BACE1 expression, and reduced soluble APPbeta and beta-C-terminal fragments in the Tg mice. At the molecular level, elevation of extracellular magnesium prevented the high-Abeta-induced reductions in synaptic NMDARs by preventing calcineurin overactivation in hippocampal slices. Correlation studies suggested that the protection of NMDAR signaling might underlie the stabilization of BACE1 expression. Our results suggest that elevation of brain magnesium exerts substantial synaptoprotective effects in a mouse model of AD and may have therapeutic potential for treating AD in humans.",

The anticipated dramatic rise in affected individuals over the next decades necessitates the development of diagnostic tests applicable to living individuals, which depends on identification of disease biomarkers. Diagnostics based on blood protein biomarkers are particularly desired since these would allow for economical, rapid and non-invasive analysis of individual biomarker profiles. Research is actively ongoing in this field and has led to the identification of autoantibodies and various proteins in the blood that may represent a disease-specific blood signature of AD.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) fundamentally represents a metabolic disease associated with brain insulin resistance. TNF-alpha/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling plays a central role in serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a potent antioxidant, has been verified to attenuate peripheral insulin resistance by reducing IRS-1 signaling blockage. This study aimed to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of EGCG on central IRS-1 signaling in vivo. APP/PS1 mice were treated with EGCG, and spatial memory was assessed by the Morris water maze test. Levels of soluble and insoluble Abeta42 in the hippocampus were determined by ELISA. The activation of NF-alpha/JNK and IRS signaling was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Our results showed that EGCG ameliorated the impaired learning and memory in APP/PS1 mice. Notably, we found a significant reduction of IRS-1pS636 level accompanied with decreased Abeta42 levels in the hippocampus of 13-month-old female APP/PS1 mice after treatment with EGCG (2 or 6 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. Furthermore, EGCG treatment inhibited TNF-alpha/JNK signaling and increased the phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that long-term consumption of EGCG may alleviate AD-related cognitive deficits by effectively attenuating central insulin resistance.",

    "title": "Insights on the binding of Thioflavin derivative markers to amyloid-like fibril models from quantum chemical calculations.",
    "abstract": "Thioflavin-T (ThT) is one of the most widely used dyes for staining and identifying amyloid fibrils, which share a common parallel in register beta-sheet structure. Unfortunately, ThT is a charged molecule, which limits its ability to cross the blood brain barrier and its use as an efficient dye for in vivo detection of amyloid fibrils. For this reason, several uncharged ThT derivatives have been designed and their binding properties to Abeta fibrils studied by fluorescence assays. However, there are still many unknowns on the binding mechanism and the role of noncovalent interactions on the affinity of these ligands toward beta-sheet structures. The present contribution analyzes the binding of ThT (1) and neutral ThT derivatives (2-7) to a beta-sheet model by means of quantum chemical B3LYP-D calculations and including solvent effects with the continuum CPCM method. Results show that, in all cases, ligand binding is mainly driven by dispersion interactions. In addition, ligands with -NH groups display hydrogen bond interactions with CO groups of the peptide strand, increasing the intrinsic affinity toward the beta-sheet surface. Solvent effects notably reduce the affinity of charged ThT, as compared to neutral systems, due to its larger solvation energy. As a result, neutral derivatives display significantly higher affinities than ThT in solution, in agreement with experimental observations. Analysis of the hydrogen bonding network of the beta-sheet structure indicates that stacking interactions upon ligand binding induce a shortening of interstrand hydrogen bonding, suggesting a strengthening of the beta-sheet.",

    "title": "Detection of brain amyloid beta deposition in patients with neuropsychological impairment after traumatic brain injury: PET evaluation using Pittsburgh Compound-B.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an epigenetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition is observed histopathologically in the traumatized brain. This study was conducted to detect cerebral Abeta deposition using amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) in patients with neuropsychological impairment after TBI. METHODS: Twelve patients with post-traumatic neuropsychological impairment (11 men and one woman, age range = 21-78 years) were examined using Pittsburgh Compound B ((11)C-PIB) PET at the chronic stage after TBI (range = 5-129 months). RESULTS: (11)C-PIB was positive in three patients and negative in the other nine patients. There was no correlation between (11)C-PIB deposition and the severity of injury; initial CT findings; elapsed time from the injury; and neuropsychological test scores. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of Abeta deposition in many patients with chronic neuropsychological impairment after TBI does not support the premise that Abeta pathology progresses over time in the traumatized brain. Early and sequential (11)C-PIB PET examination may clarify the time course of Abeta deposition in the traumatized brain and the relationship between traumatic brain insult and subsequent neuropsychological impairment.",

    "title": "Ubiquilin-1 modulates gamma-secretase-mediated epsilon-site cleavage in neuronal cells.",
    "abstract": "Ubiquilin-1 is an Alzheimer's disease-associated protein, which is known to modulate amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, amyloid-beta (Abeta) secretion, and presenilin-1 (PS1) accumulation. Here, we aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which full-length transcript variant 1 of ubiquilin-1 (TV1) affects APP processing and gamma-secretase function in human neuroblastoma cells stably overexpressing APP (SH-SY5Y-APP751). We found that TV1 overexpression significantly increased the level of APP intracellular domain (AICD) generation. However, there was no increase in the levels of secreted Abeta40, Abeta42, or total Abeta, suggesting that ubiquilin-1 in particular enhances gamma-secretase-mediated epsilon-site cleavage. This is supported by the finding that TV1 also significantly increased the level of intracellular domain generation of another gamma-secretase substrate, leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) phosphatase. However, in these cells, the increase in AICD levels was abolished, suggesting a preference of the gamma-secretase for LAR over APP. TV2, another ubiquilin-1 variant that lacks the protein fragment encoded by exon 8, did not increase the level of AICD generation like TV1 did. The subcellular and plasma membrane localization of APP or gamma-secretase complex components PS1 and nicastrin was not altered in TV1-overexpressing cells. Moreover, the effects of TV1 were not mediated by altered expression or APP binding of FE65, an adaptor protein thought to regulate AICD generation and stability. These data suggest that ubiquilin-1 modulates gamma-secretase-mediated epsilon-site cleavage and thus may play a role in regulating gamma-secretase cleavage of various substrates.",

    "abstract": "Classic cardio-metabolic risk factors such as hypertension, stroke, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia all increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. We found increased transcription of beta-secretase/BACE1, the rate-limiting enzyme for Abeta generation, in eNOS-deficient mouse brains and after feeding mice a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet. Up- or downregulation of PGC-1alpha reciprocally regulated BACE1 in vitro and in vivo. Modest fasting in mice reduced BACE1 transcription in the brains, which was accompanied by elevated PGC-1 expression and activity. Moreover, the suppressive effect of PGC-1 was dependent on activated PPARgamma, likely via SIRT1-mediated deacetylation in a ligand-independent manner. The BACE1 promoter contains multiple PPAR-RXR sites, and direct interactions among SIRT1-PPARgamma-PGC-1 at these sites were enhanced with fasting. The interference on the BACE1 gene identified here represents a unique noncanonical mechanism of PPARgamma-PGC-1 in transcriptional repression in neurons in response to metabolic signals that may involve recruitment of corepressor NCoR.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence shows the disruption of hippocampal neurotrophins secretion leads to memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal models. Invasive injection of exogenous neurotrophins into hippocampus reverses spatial memory deficits, but its clinical application is limited by traumatic brain injury during the injection procedure. Notably, recent studies have demonstrated that noninvasive repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) increases endogenous neurotrophins contents in the brain of normal rats. Whether low-frequency rTMS can reverse Abeta(1-42)-mediated decrease in hippocampal neurotrophins contents and spatial memory impairment is still unclear. Here, we reported that severe deficit in long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial memory were observed in an Abeta(1-42)-induced toxicity rat model. Furthermore, neurotrophins (NGF and BDNF) and NMDA-receptor levels were decreased after Abeta injection. However, low-frequency rTMS markedly reversed the decrease in neurotrophins contents. And the rTMS-induced increment of neurotrophins up-regulated hippocampal NMDA-receptor expression. Moreover, low-frequency rTMS rescued deficits in LTP and spatial memory of rats with Abeta-injection. These results indicate that low-frequency rTMS noninvasively and effectively increases hippocampal neurotrophins and NMDA-receptor contents in Abeta(1-42)-induced toxicity model rats, which helps to enhance hippocampal LTP and reverses Abeta(1-42)-mediated memory deficits.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized, in part, by atrophy of the adult brain and increased presence of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques. Previous studies in our lab have shown that peripheral inflammation can lead to increased central Abeta and deficits in learning and memory. In order to determine whether Abeta accumulation in the brain is responsible for the learning deficits, we attempted to decrease peripheral production of Abeta in order to reduce central Abeta accumulation. It has previously been shown that Abeta is produced in large quantities in the liver, and is transferred across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Recent research has shown that peripheral treatment with imatinib methanesulfonate salt (IM), known to interfere with the interaction between gamma (gamma)-secretase and the gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP), decreases the cleavage of peripheral amyloid precursor protein into Abeta. Because IM poorly penetrates the BBB, we hypothesized that co-administration of IM with LPS would decrease peripheral production of Abeta in the presence of LPS-induced inflammation, leading to a decrease in Abeta accumulation in the hippocampus. We show that peripheral IM treatment eliminates hippocampal Abeta elevation that follows LPS-induced peripheral inflammation. Importantly, IM also eliminates the cognitive impairment seen following seven consecutive days of LPS administration, implicating Abeta peptides as a likely cause of these cognitive deficits.",

    "abstract": "It is assumed that the concentration of amyloid-beta1-40 (Abeta1-40) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reflects the total amount of Abeta protein in the brain and thus allows a better interpretation of inter-individual differences in Abeta quantity than the Abeta1-42 concentration. In this study, Abeta1-40 was added to the existing CSF biomarker panel of Abeta1-42, total tau (T-tau), and phosphorylated tau (P-tau181P) in order to test whether the accuracy of the differential dementia diagnosis improved. The concentration of Abeta1-40 (INNOTEST  beta-amyloid(1-40) prototype version, Innogenetics NV, Belgium) and the other biomarkers (INNOTEST ) was determined in CSF samples from 80 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, 75 non-AD dementia patients, and 30 controls. A large proportion of the study population had autopsy-confirmed neurodegeneration (AD: 73/80 = 91%; non-AD: 38/75 = 51%). The levels of Abeta1-40 were decreased in AD (10856 +- 4745 pg/mL) and non-AD patients (10519 +- 4491 pg/mL) when compared to controls (14760 +- 7846 pg/mL) (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001). The Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio was significantly decreased in AD (0.043 +- 0.021) as compared to non-AD patients (0.064 +- 0.027; p < 0.001) and controls (0.053 +- 0.023; p < 0.001). In order to differentiate AD from non-AD patients, a decision tree was constructed. The diagnostic accuracy of the decision tree that contained Abeta1-42, Abeta1-40, P-tau181P, and the Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio was significantly better than the diagnostic accuracy (80% versus 74%) of the decision tree without Abeta1-40 and the Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio (p < 0.001). In conclusion, no difference in Abeta1-40 CSF levels was found between AD and non-AD patients, but adding CSF Abeta1-40 and the CSF Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio to a biomarker-based decision tree, might have an added value for discriminating AD from non-AD patients in case of intermediate CSF P-tau181P values.",

    "abstract": "Soluble amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) oligomers have been hypothesized to be primary mediators of Alzheimer's disease progression. In this regard, reduction of soluble Abeta-oligomers levels within the brain may provide a viable means in which to treat the disease. Somatostatin receptor subtype-4 (SSTR4) agonists have been proposed to reduce Abeta levels in the brain via enhancement of enzymatic degradation. Herein we evaluated the effect of selective SSTR4 agonist NNC 26-9100 on the changes in learning and soluble Abeta42 oligomer brain content with and without co-administration of the M13-metalloproteinase family enzyme-inhibitor phosphoramidon, using the senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8) model. NNC 26-9100 treatment (0.2 microg i.c.v. in 2 microL) improved learning, which was blocked by phosphoramidon (1 and 10mM, respectively). NNC 26-9100 decreased total soluble Abeta42, an effect which was blocked by phosphoramidon (10mM). Extracellular, intracellular, and membrane fractions were then isolated from cortical tissue and assessed for soluble oligomer alterations. NNC 26-9100 decreased the Abeta42 trimeric (12 kDa) form within the extracellular and intracellular fractions, and produced a band-split effect of the Abeta42 hexameric (25 kDa) form within the extracellular fraction. These effects were also blocked by phosphoramdon (1 and 10mM, respectively). Subsequent evaluation of NNC 26-9100 in APPswe Tg2576 transgenic mice showed a similar learning improvement and corresponding reduction in soluble Abeta42 oligomers within extracellular, intracellular, and membrane fractions. These data support the hypothesis that NNC 26-9100 reduces soluble Abeta42 oligomers and enhances learning through a phosphoramidon-sensitive metalloproteinase-dependent mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, senile plaque. The Abeta peptide is cleaved from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase. Until now, many literatures have documented that the high concentration of copper is present in Abeta plaques and enhances aggregation of. The APP copper binding domain (CuBD) is located in the N-terminal next to the growth factor-like domain that gets involved in APP homodimerization. Importantly, dimerization of APP has profound effect on Abeta production. We investigated whether copper alters the state of APP dimerization and how it affects APP metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that copper enhanced APP dimerization and increased extracellular release of Abeta. Moreover, copper chelator, D-penicillamine, suppressed APP dimerization and decreased extracellular release of Abeta. These results suggest that the action of copper may be profoundly associated with the pathway of Abeta production in AD pathogenesis.",

In this study, we examined the role of APP in neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) proliferation. NSPCs derived from APP-overexpressing Tg2576 transgenic mice proliferated more rapidly than NSPCs from the corresponding background strain (C57Bl/6xSJL) wild-type mice. In contrast, NSPCs from APP knock-out (APP-KO) mice had reduced proliferation rates when compared with NSPCs from the corresponding background strain (C57Bl/6). A secreted factor, identified as cystatin C, was found to be responsible for this effect. Levels of cystatin C were higher in the Tg2576 conditioned medium and lower in the APP-KO conditioned medium. Furthermore, immunodepletion of cystatin C from the conditioned medium completely removed the ability of the conditioned medium to increase NSPC proliferation. The results demonstrate that APP expression stimulates NSPC proliferation and that this effect is mediated via an increase in cystatin C secretion.",

This study investigated whether reconstitution of amyloid-beta (Abeta) after CCI in Bace1(-/-) animals would reverse the detrimental effect of Bace1 deletion. METHODS: Bace1(-/-) and wild type Bace1(+/+) (C57Bl/6) mice were subjected to CCI (n = 14-23/group) or sham injury (n = 6/group). After injury, mice underwent intracerebroventricular injections of Abeta40 (n = 23 Bace1(-/-) and 17 Bace1(+/+) per group) or vehicle (n = 14 Bace1(-/-) and 22 Bace1(+/+) per group). Functional outcomes were assessed with wire grip (motor) and Morris water maze (spatial memory). Soluble Abeta levels were assessed at 24 hours and 21 days after CCI. Lesion volume was assessed 21 days after injury. RESULTS: At 24 hours after injury, Abeta-treated Bace1(-/-) mice had Abeta40 levels similar to vehicle-treated Bace1(+/+) mice, but by 21 days after injury there were no differences between Abeta-treated versus vehicle-treated Bace1(-/-) mice. Reconstitution with Abeta40 improved motor but not spatial memory or histopathological outcome in injured Bace1(-/-) mice. In contrast, treatment with Abeta40 worsened motor performance in Bace1(+/+) mice. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest Abeta40 may have some beneficial effects after CCI in young adult mice and that therapies targeting BACE should be approached cautiously.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating disorder that is clinically characterized by a comprehensive cognitive decline. Accumulation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD. In AD, the conversion of Abeta from a physiological soluble monomeric form into insoluble fibrillar conformation is an important event. The most toxic form of Abeta is oligomers, which is the intermediate step during the conversion of monomeric form to fibrillar form. There are at least two types of oligomers: oligomers that are immunologically related to fibrils and those that are not. In transgenic AD animal models, both active and passive anti-Abeta immunotherapies improve cognitive function and clear the parenchymal accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. In this report we studied effect of immunotherapy of two sequence-independent non-fibrillar oligomer specific monoclonal antibodies on the cognitive function, amyloid load and tau pathology in 3xTg-AD mice. Anti-oligomeric monoclonal antibodies significantly reduce the amyloid load and improve the cognition. The clearance of amyloid load was significantly correlated with reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and improvement in cognition. These results demonstrate that systemic immunotherapy using oligomer-specific monoclonal antibodies effectively attenuates behavioral and pathological impairments in 3xTg-AD mice. These findings demonstrate the potential of using oligomer specific monoclonal antibodies as a therapeutic approach to prevent and treat Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are two major pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. One is the progressive accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the form of senile plaques; the other is hyperphosphorylated tau, causing neuronal apoptosis. Some inhalation anesthetics, such as isoflurane and desflurane, have been suggested to induce Abeta accumulation and cause AD-like neuropathogenesis. Whether intravenous anesthetics have similar effects is still unclear. We therefore set out to determine the relationship between propofol and AD-like pathogenesis. METHODS: PC12 cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 12 hours prior to drug treatment. Various concentrations from 5 micromol/L to 80 micromol/L of aggregated Abeta25-35 were added to determine a proper concentration for further study. After exposure to 10 micromol/L Abeta25-35 alone or with 20 micromol/L propofol for 6 hours, PC12 cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Western blotting and immunocytochemical staining were performed to observe the protein expression of the Bcl-2 family, tau phosphorylation at different sites, and tau protein kinases and phosphatases. RESULTS: Abeta25-35 induced a decrease in PC12 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Exposure to 10 micromol/L Abeta25-35 for 6 hours resulted in the mild cell survival, accompanied by a decline in Bcl-2, and an increase in phosphorylation of GSK-3beta and tau at different sites. Compared with the Abeta25-35 group, cells treated with propofol alone showed no significant difference, while cells co-incubated with propofol and Abeta25-35 showed a significantly higher survival rate (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). Tau phosphorylation at Ser396, Ser404 and Thr231 and the level of GSK-3beta in PC12 cells increased after exposure to 10 micromol/L Abeta25-35. Co-incubation with propofol attenuated cellular apoptosis by inhibiting tau phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that propofol may protect PC12 cells from Abeta25-35-induced apoptosis and tau hyperphosphorylation through the GSK-3beta pathway, therefore it may be a safer anesthesia for AD and elderly patients.",

We previously reported that ubiquitous expression of FAD-linked PS1 variants in mice impairs environmental enrichment (EE)-induced proliferation and neuronal commitment of adult hippocampal neural progenitor cells (AHNPCs). Notably, the self-renewal and differentiation properties of cultured AHNPCs expressing either human PS1 wild-type or PS1 variants were identical, suggesting that accessory cells within the hippocampal niche expressing PS1 variants may modulate AHNPC phenotypes in vivo. We now report that nontransgenic mouse AHNPCs transduced with retroviruses harboring cDNAs that encode either human PS1 wild-type or FAD-linked PS1 variants show no differences in EE-mediated proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Moreover, conditional inactivation of a mutant PS1 transgene in type-1 primary progenitor cells failed to rescue impairments of EE-induced proliferation, survival, or neurogenesis. In contrast, conditional inactivation of the mutant PS1 transgene in excitatory neurons of the mouse forebrain largely rescued the deficits in EE-induced proliferation and survival of AHNPCs, but not their differentiation into mature neuronal phenotypes. These results persuasively argue for a noncell autonomous effect of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on EE-mediated adult hippocampal neurogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The role of the structure and dynamics of the central Abeta21-30 decapeptide region of the full-length Abeta is considered crucial in the aggregation pathway of Abeta. Here we report results of isobaric-isothermal (NPT) all-atom explicit water molecular dynamics simulations of the monomeric form of the wild-type Abeta21-30 fragment in aqueous salt environments formed by neurobiologically important group IA (NaCl, KCl) and group IIA (CaCl2, MgCl2) salts. Our simulations reveal the existence of salt-specific changes to secondary structure propensities, lifetimes, hydrogen bonding, salt-bridge formation, and decapeptide-ion contacts of this decapeptide. These results suggest that aqueous environments with the CaCl2 salt, and to a much lesser extent the MgCl2 salt, have profound effects by increasing random coil structure propensities and lifetimes and diminishing intrapeptide hydrogen bonding. These effects are rationalized in terms of direct cation-decapeptide contacts and changes to the hydration-shell water molecules. On the other side of the spectrum, environments with the NaCl and KCl salts have little influence on the decapeptide's secondary structure despite increasing hydrogen bonding, salt-bridge formation, and lifetime of turn structures. The observed enhancement of open structures by group IIA may be of importance in the folding and aggregation pathway of the full-length Abeta.",

Since Abeta is closely associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, understanding the biological function, particularly the catalytic activities of memapsin 2, would assist in a better understanding of the disease and the development of its inhibitors. The transmembrane and cytosolic domains of memapsin 2 function in cellular transport and localization, which are important regulatory mechanisms for its activity. The catalytic ectodomain contains a long substrate cleft that is responsible for substrate recognition, specificity, and peptide bond hydrolysis. The substrate cleft accommodates 11 residues of the substrate in separate binding subsites. Besides APP, a number of membrane proteins have been reported to be substrates of memapsin 2. The elucidation for the specificity of these subsites and the amino acid sequences surrounding the memapsin 2 cleavage site in these proteins has led to the establishment of a predictive model that can quantitatively estimate the efficiency of cleavage for any potential substrates. Such tools may be employed for future studies of memapsin 2 about its biological function.

We used solution NMR to determine that tranilast binds to Abeta40 monomers with ~300 muM affinity. Remarkably, tranilast increases Abeta40 fibrillation more than 20-fold in the thioflavin T assay at a 1:1 molar ratio, as well as significantly reducing the lag time. Tranilast likely promotes fibrillation by shifting Abeta monomer conformations to those capable of seed formation and fibril elongation. Molecular docking results qualitatively agree with NMR chemical shift perturbation, which together indicate that hydrophobic interactions are the major driving force of the Abeta-tranilast interaction. These data suggest that AD may be a potential complication for tranilast usage in elderly patients.",

The rate limiting step in the nucleation pathway involves crossing a barrier of approximately 40 kcal/mol and is associated with the formation of a very specific interdigitation of the side chains belonging to different sheets.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) is abundantly present in the central nervous system. Although its function has been extensively interrogated in the context of peripheral inflammation, novel roles for this protein are emerging in the central nervous system. The objective of our study was to investigate the functional role that FLAP plays in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with plaques and tangles (i.e., 3xTg mice). METHODS: By implementing a genetic knockout of FLAP and pharmacologic inhibition with a FLAP inhibitor (MK-591), we evaluated the effect on the AD-like neuropathology, cognition, and synaptic plasticity in the 3xTg mice. RESULTS: We show that reduction of FLAP leads to amelioration of cognition and memory along with the rescuing of synaptic dysfunction at an early age before the development of overt neuropathology. Genetic knockout and pharmacologic inhibition of FLAP also yielded an improvement in AD pathology through a reduction in Abeta via the gamma-secretase pathway and a decrease in tau phosphorylation through the cdk5 pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies identify a novel functional role for FLAP in regulating memory and synaptic plasticity. They establish this protein at the crossroad of multiple pathways that ultimately contribute to the development of the entire AD-like phenotype, making it a viable therapeutic target with disease-modifying capacity for the treatment of this disease.",

However, the onset and mechanism of declined neurogenesis are not fully elucidated. Here we show that the major decline in neurogenesis takes place during adulthood, before aging. Decline in neurogenesis takes place in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus and in the subventricular zone, and is primarily due to a reduced number of fast-proliferating neural progenitor cells. Importantly, this decline can be rescued by intraventricular injection of recombinant soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPPalpha), which regulates neural progenitor cell proliferation in the adult brain. The counterpart, sAPPbeta, a product of the amyloidogenic cleavage pathway of amyloid precursor protein, fails to exhibit a proliferative effect in vitro and in vivo, in equimolar concentrations to sAPPalpha. These observations suggest that adulthood is an appropriate time window for an intervention that upregulates neurogenesis, such as enhancement of sAPPalpha levels, for the prevention of declining brain plasticity and cognitive function.",

    "abstract": "For 20 years the amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) has placed the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), formed from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), centre stage in the process of neurodegeneration. However, no new therapeutic agents have reached the clinic through exploitation of the hypothesis. The APP metabolites, including Abeta, generated by its proteolytic processing, have distinct physiological functions. In particular, the cleaved intracellular domain of APP (AICD) regulates expression of several genes, including APP itself, the beta-secretase BACE-1 and the Abeta-degrading enzyme, neprilysin and this transcriptional regulation involves direct promoter binding of AICD. Of the three major splice isoforms of APP (APP695, APP751, APP770), APP695 is the predominant neuronal form, from which Abeta and transcriptionally-active AICD are preferentially generated by selective processing through the amyloidogenic pathway. Despite intensive research, the normal functions of the APP isoforms remain an enigma. APP plays an important role in brain development, memory and synaptic plasticity and secreted forms of APP are neuroprotective. A fuller understanding of the physiological and pathological actions of APP and its metabolic and gene regulatory network could provide new therapeutic opportunities in neurodegeneration, including AD.",

    "title": "Ferritin light chain interacts with PEN-2 and affects gamma-secretase activity.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is primarily caused by overproduction/deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brain. Dysregulation of iron in the brain also contributes to AD. Although iron affects beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression and Abeta deposition, detailed role of iron in AD requires further elucidation. Abeta is produced by sequential proteolytic cleavages of APP by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase. The gamma-secretase complex comprises presenilins (PS1 or PS2), nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2. Herein, we find that PEN-2 can interact with ferritin light chain (FTL), an important component of the iron storage protein ferritin. In addition, we show that overexpression of FTL increases the protein levels of PEN-2 and PS1 amino-terminal fragment (NTF) and promotes gamma-secretase activity for more production of Abeta and notch intracellular domain (NICD). Furthermore, iron treatments increase the levels of FTL, PEN-2 and PS1 NTF and promote gamma-secretase-mediated NICD production. Moreover, downregulation of FTL decreases the levels of PEN-2 and PS1 NTF. Together, our results suggest that iron can increase gamma-secretase activity through promoting the level of FTL that interacts with and stabilizes PEN-2, providing a new molecular link between iron, PEN-2/gamma-secretase and Abeta generation in AD.",

However, a possible role in AD aetiology has largely been neglected. In the present report, we demonstrate that Abeta4-42 rapidly forms aggregates possessing a high aggregation propensity in terms of monomer consumption and oligomer formation. Short-term treatment of primary cortical neurons indicated that Abeta4-42 is as toxic as pyroglutamate Abeta3-42 and Abeta1-42. In line with these findings, treatment of wildtype mice using intraventricular Abeta injection induced significant working memory deficits with Abeta4-42, pyroglutamate Abeta3-42 and Abeta1-42. Transgenic mice expressing Abeta4-42 (Tg4-42 transgenic line) developed a massive CA1 pyramidal neuron loss in the hippocampus. The hippocampus-specific expression of Abeta4-42 correlates well with age-dependent spatial reference memory deficits assessed by the Morris water maze test. Our findings indicate that N-truncated Abeta4-42 triggers acute and long-lasting behavioral deficits comparable to AD typical memory dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify a neuroimaging signature predictive of brain amyloidosis as a screening tool to identify individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that are most likely to have high levels of brain amyloidosis or to be amyloid-free. METHODS: The prediction model cohort included 62 MCI subjects screened with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and (11) C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PET). We identified an anatomical shape variation-based neuroimaging predictor of brain amyloidosis and defined a structural MRI-based brain amyloidosis score (sMRI-BAS). Amyloid beta positivity (Abeta(+) ) predictive power of sMRI-BAS was validated on an independent cohort of 153 MCI patients with cerebrospinal fluid Abeta1-42 biomarker data but no amyloid PET scans. We compared the Abeta(+) predictive power of sMRI-BAS to those of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype and hippocampal volume, the 2 most relevant candidate biomarkers for the prediction of brain amyloidosis. RESULTS: Anatomical shape variations predictive of brain amyloidosis in MCI embraced a characteristic spatial pattern known for high vulnerability to Alzheimer disease pathology, including the medial temporal lobe, temporal-parietal association cortices, posterior cingulate, precuneus, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, and fornix/stria terminals. Abeta(+) prediction performance of sMRI-BAS and ApoE genotype jointly was significantly better than the performance of each predictor separately (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.88 vs AUC = 0.70 and AUC = 0.81, respectively) with >90% sensitivity and specificity at 20% false-positive rate and false-negative rate thresholds. Performance of hippocampal volume as an independent predictor of brain amyloidosis in MCI was only marginally better than random chance (AUC = 0.56). INTERPRETATION: As one of the first attempts to use an imaging technique that does not require amyloid-specific radioligands for identification of individuals with brain amyloidosis, our findings could lead to development of multidisciplinary/multimodality brain amyloidosis biomarkers that are reliable, minimally invasive, and widely available.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The newly proposed National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer disease (AD) suggest a combination of clinical features and biomarker measures, but their performance in the community is not known. METHODS: The Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) is a population-based longitudinal study of nondemented subjects in Olmsted County, Minnesota. A sample of 154 MCI subjects from the MCSA was compared to a sample of 58 amnestic MCI subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) to assess the applicability of the criteria in both settings and to assess their outcomes. RESULTS: Fourteen percent of MCSA and 16% of ADNI-1 of subjects were biomarker negative. In addition, 14% of MCSA and 12% of ADNI-1 subjects had evidence for amyloid deposition only, whereas 43% of MCSA and 55% of ADNI-1 subjects had evidence for amyloid deposition plus neurodegeneration (magnetic resonance imaging atrophy, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography hypometabolism, or both). However, a considerable number of subjects had biomarkers inconsistent with the proposed AD model; for example, 29% of MCSA subjects and 17% of ADNI-1 subjects had evidence for neurodegeneration without amyloid deposition. These subjects may not be on an AD pathway. Neurodegeneration appears to be a key factor in predicting progression relative to amyloid deposition alone. INTERPRETATION: The NIA-AA criteria apply to most MCI subjects in both the community and clinical trials settings; however, a sizeable proportion of subjects had conflicting biomarkers, which may be very important and need to be explored.",

Given prior reports demonstrating benefits of GABAA modulation for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment, we wished to determine whether this agent might be beneficial for AD. CHO cells engineered to overexpress wild-type amyloid precursor protein (APP), primary culture neuronal cells from AD mice (Tg2576) and AD mice were treated with baicalein. In the cell cultures, baicalein significantly reduced the production of beta-amyloid (Abeta) by increasing APP alpha-processing. These effects were blocked by the GABAA antagonist bicuculline. Likewise, AD mice treated daily with i.p. baicalein for 8 weeks showed enhanced APP alpha-secretase processing, reduced Abeta production, and reduced AD-like pathology together with improved cognitive performance. Our findings suggest that baicalein promotes nonamyloidogenic processing of APP, thereby reducing Abeta production and improving cognitive performance, by activating GABAA receptors.",

    "title": "Structural insights into Abeta42 oligomers using site-directed spin labeling.",
    "abstract": "Oligomerization of the 42-residue peptide Abeta42 plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Despite great academic and medical interest, the structures of these oligomers have not been well characterized. Site-directed spin labeling combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy is a powerful approach for studying structurally ill-defined systems, but its application in amyloid oligomer structure study has not been systematically explored. Here we report a comprehensive structural study on a toxic Abeta42 oligomer, called globulomer, using site-directed spin labeling complemented by other techniques. Transmission electron microscopy shows that these oligomers are globular structures with diameters of ~7-8 nm. Circular dichroism shows primarily beta-structures. X-ray powder diffraction suggests a highly ordered intrasheet hydrogen-bonding network and a heterogeneous intersheet packing. Residue-level mobility analysis on spin labels introduced at 14 different positions shows a structured state and a disordered state at all labeling sites. Side chain mobility analysis suggests that structural order increases from N- to C-terminal regions. Intermolecular distance measurements at 14 residue positions suggest that C-terminal residues Gly-29-Val-40 form a tightly packed core with intermolecular distances in a narrow range of 11.5-12.5 A. These intermolecular distances rule out the existence of fibril-like parallel in-register beta-structures and strongly suggest an antiparallel beta-sheet arrangement in Abeta42 globulomers.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation and fibril formation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides onto a ganglioside-rich lipid membrane is a cause of neuro-disturbance diseases. To find out a measure for suppressing the nucleation of a seed for amyloid fibrils, the mechanism of the initial binding of Abeta to the membrane should be clarified. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to investigate the adhesion process of Abeta peptides onto a GM1-ganglioside-containing membrane. Multiple computational trials were executed to analyze the probability of occurrence of Abeta binding by using calculation models containing a mixed lipid membrane, water layer, and one, two, or three Abetas. The simulations demonstrated that Abeta peptides approached the membrane after fluctuation in the water layer and occasionally made steady contact with the membrane. Once the steady contact had been established, Abeta was unlikely to be detached from the membrane and developed into a more stably bound form. In the stably bound form, neuraminic acids on the GM1 cluster strongly held the side chain of Lys28 of Abeta, which caused deformation of the C-terminal region of the Abeta. Since the C-terminal region of the Abeta peptide contains many hydrophobic residues, its deformation on the membrane enhances the hydrophobic interaction with other Abeta peptides. The contact region of two Abetas evolved into a parallel beta-sheet form, and the third Abeta was observed to be bound to the complex of two Abetas to make a bundle of Abeta peptides. Some key structures involved in the Abeta aggregation on the GM1-containing membrane were deduced from the multiple simulations.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It has been proposed that only mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with high Abeta amyloid is indicative of incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet MCI with low Abeta amyloid may reflect other neurodegenerative processes. We aimed to determine the extent to which high Abeta amyloid influenced cognitive function in healthy older adults and adults with MCI. METHOD: Healthy controls (HC; n = 178) and adults with MCI (n = 56) enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle study, underwent positron emission tomography neuroimaging for Abeta amyloid and completed an extensive neuropsychological battery, assessing the cognitive domains of verbal and visual episodic memory, executive function, visuoconstruction, attention and processing speed, and language at baseline. RESULTS: MCI with low Abeta performed worse than MCI with high Abeta on measures of executive function, attention, visuoconstruction and language. No differences were observed between HC high and low Abeta groups. When compared with HC with low Abeta, both MCI high and low Abeta groups performed worse on measures of episodic memory. However, only the MCI low Abeta group performed worse than HC low Abeta on measures of executive function, attention, visuoconstruction, and language. CONCLUSIONS: When compared with HC with low Abeta amyloid, MCI with high Abeta amyloid present with impairments restricted to episodic memory, and the episodic memory impairments in MCI with low Abeta amyloid were accompanied by impairments in executive function, attention, visuoconstruction, and language, suggesting that MCI with high Abeta amyloid reflects prodromal AD, although further longitudinal data is required to confirm this.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of subjective memory complaints (SMCs) in the diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's type is unclear. While some studies have found an association between SMCs and cognitive decline, many have found a stronger association with depression, which raises questions about their diagnostic utility. METHODS: We examined the cross-sectional association between SMC severity (as measured using the MAC-Q, a brief SMC questionnaire) and affect, memory, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers (beta-amyloid deposition and the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOEepsilon4) allele) in healthy elderly controls (HC; M = 78.74 years, SD = 6.7) and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; M = 72.74 years, SD = 8.8). We analyzed a subset of individuals drawn from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Study of Aging. RESULTS: SMCs were more severe in MCI patients than in HCs. SMC severity was related to affective variables and the interaction between age and group membership (HC/MCI). Within the HC group, SMC severity was related to affective variables only, while severity correlated only with age in the MCI group. SMCs were not related to cognitive variables or AD biomarkers. CONCLUSION: SMCs were related to solely by poorer mood (greater depressive and anxious symptomatology) in the cognitively healthy elderly however mean levels were subclinical. This finding argues for the assessment of affective symptomatology in conjunction with cognitive assessment in elderly memory complainers. Future AIBL research will focus on assessing other AD biomarkers, such as brain atrophy and Abeta plasma markers, in relation to complaint severity. Once our 36-month follow-up data are collected, we propose to assess whether SMCs can predict future cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been hampered by a lack of sensitive and specific non-invasive diagnostic methods. Quantum dots (QD) are nano-crystals with unique photo-physical properties that bypass some of the limitations of conventional dyes and imaging tools. This study is aimed to evaluate the fluorescence properties of a QD probe conjugated with an anti-Abeta antibody (QD-Abeta-Ab). Healthy mice and mice bearing mutated human APP695swe and APP717 V-F transgenes received intracerebroventricular injection of the probe for subsequent imaging. Immunohistochemistry revealed that Abeta1-42 was distributed in the hippocampus CA1 area in the APP transgenic mice. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that fluorescence was mainly observed in the hippocampus area, the cerebral cortex, sagittal septum and striatum of APP transgenic mice. In vivo imaging of mice receiving the QD-Abeta-Ab probe showed that healthy mice exhibited a narrow range of fluorescence and lower fluorescence intensity compared with APP transgenic mice. The mean fluorescence intensity of brain tissues of healthy C57BL mice was 12.3784 +- 3.9826, which was significantly lower than that of 10- and 16-month-old APP transgenic mice (45.03 +- 2.66 and 46.69 +- 3.22, respectively; P < 0.05). In this study we present the first direct evidence that QD-Abeta-Ab conjugate probes can track in vivo state of Abeta accumulation in mice and the findings suggest that such probes may be of potential use for early molecular diagnostic imaging of AD.",

In this study, tPA and truncated tPA constructs, lacking the finger domain, were tested for their ability to bind to Abeta and AIAPP amyloid-like fibrils. Surface plasmon resonance experiments and pull-down assays clearly show that indeed tPA binds, but that the finger domain is not essential. Another possible binding mechanism via the lysine binding site on the kringle 2 domain was also not crucial for the binding. Immuno-electron microscopy studies show that tPA binds to fibril sides.

    "abstract": "beta-Amyloid peptide (Abeta) immunization is regarded as the most promising therapy to Alzheimer' s disease. The full length Abeta as antigen might induce meningoencepholontis adverse effect since the middle and C-terminal fragments of Abeta contain T cell epitopes. While N-terminal fragment of Abeta, containing B cell epitope, has weak or no immunogenicity. To improve the immunogenicity, we used HBV core antigen as carrier to make fusion protein containing 2 Abeta1-15. The fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli harboring the recombinant plasmid pET/c-2Abeta15-c. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) showed that fusion protein could form virus-like particles (VLPs). After 7-weeks immunization with Abeta-HBc VLPs through subcutaneous injection, the titer of anti-Abeta antibody in sera of BALB/c mice reached up to 10(5), higher than Abeta peptide immunization. Abeta-HBc VLPs immunization did not elicit Abeta-specific T cell proliferation. The main isotypes of antibody in mice immunized with Abeta-HBc VLPs were IgG1 and IgG2b, while isotype in mice immunized with Abeta1-42 was IgG2a. When the antisera from mice immunized with Abeta-HBc VLPs were co-incubated for 1 week at 37 C with Abeta, fibers of aggregated Abeta was reduced or diminished. The antibodies also prevented PC12 cells from injury by toxicity of Abeta. In conclusion, recombinant c-2Abeta15-c gene can be expressed in E. coli. The expressed protein could form VLPs and has strong immunogenicity. The antisera prevented Abeta fiber formation and protected the PC12 cells against toxicity of Abeta.

To study how mtDNA damage affects reactive oxygen species and amyloid beta (Abeta) pathology in vivo, we generated an Alzheimer's disease mouse model expressing an inducible mitochondrial-targeted endonuclease (Mito-PstI) in the central nervous system. Mito-PstI cleaves mtDNA causing mostly an mtDNA depletion, which leads to a partial oxidative phosphorylation defect when expressed during a short period in adulthood. We found that a mild mitochondrial dysfunction in adult neurons did not exacerbate Abeta accumulation and decreased plaque pathology. Mito-PstI expression altered the cleavage pathway of amyloid precursor protein without increasing oxidative stress in the brain. These data suggest that mtDNA damage is not a primary cause of Abeta accumulation.",

    "abstract": "The generation of toxic oligomers during the aggregation of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide Abeta42 into amyloid fibrils and plaques has emerged as a central feature of the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease, but the molecular pathways that control pathological aggregation have proved challenging to identify. Here, we use a combination of kinetic studies, selective radiolabeling experiments, and cell viability assays to detect directly the rates of formation of both fibrils and oligomers and the resulting cytotoxic effects. Our results show that once a small but critical concentration of amyloid fibrils has accumulated, the toxic oligomeric species are predominantly formed from monomeric peptide molecules through a fibril-catalyzed secondary nucleation reaction, rather than through a classical mechanism of homogeneous primary nucleation. This catalytic mechanism couples together the growth of insoluble amyloid fibrils and the generation of diffusible oligomeric aggregates that are implicated as neurotoxic agents in Alzheimer's disease. These results reveal that the aggregation of Abeta42 is promoted by a positive feedback loop that originates from the interactions between the monomeric and fibrillar forms of this peptide. Our findings bring together the main molecular species implicated in the Abeta aggregation cascade and suggest that perturbation of the secondary nucleation pathway identified in this study could be an effective strategy to control the proliferation of neurotoxic Abeta42 oligomers.",

    "abstract": "Fibrillar amyloid-beta (fAbeta) peptide causes neuronal cell death, which is known as Alzheimer's disease. One of the mechanisms for neuronal cell death is the activation of microglia which releases toxic compounds like reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to fAbeta. We observed that fAbeta rather than soluble form blocked BV2 cell proliferation of microglial cell line BV2, while N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), a scavenger of superoxide, prevented the cells from death, suggesting that cell death is induced by ROS. Indeed, both fAbeta1-42 and fAbeta25-35 induced superoxide production in BV2 cells. fAbeta25-35 produced superoxide, although fAbeta25-35 is not phagocytosed into BV2 cells. Thus, superoxide production by fAbeta does not seem to be dependent on phagocytosis of fAbeta. Herein we studied how fAbeta produces superoxide in BV2. Transfection of dominant negative (DN) RhoA (N19) cDNA plasmid, small hairpin (sh)-RhoA forming plasmid, and Y27632, an inhibitor of Rho-kinase, abrogated the superoxide formation in BV2 cells stimulated by fAbeta. Furthermore, fAbeta elevated GTP-RhoA level as well as Rac1 and Cdc42. Tat-C3 toxin, sh-RhoA, and Y27632 inhibited the phosphorylation of p47(PHOX). Moreover, peritoneal macrophages from p47(PHOX) (-/-) knockout mouse could not produce superoxide in response to fAbeta. These results suggest that RhoA closely engages in the regulation of superoxide production induced by fAbeta through phosphorylation of p47(PHOX) in microglial BV2 cells.",

    "abstract": "Gene duplication provides genetic material required for functional diversification. An interesting example is the amyloid precursor protein (APP) protein family. The APP gene family has experienced both expansion and contraction during evolution. The three mammalian members have been studied quite extensively in combined knock out models. The underlying assumption is that APP, amyloid precursor like protein 1 and 2 (APLP1, APLP2) are functionally redundant. This assumption is primarily supported by the similarities in biochemical processing of APP and APLPs and on the fact that the different APP genes appear to genetically interact at the level of the phenotype in combined knockout mice. However, unique features in each member of the APP family possibly contribute to specification of their function. In the current review, we discuss the evolution and the biology of the APP protein family with special attention to the distinct properties of each homologue. We propose that the functions of APP, APLP1 and APLP2 have diverged after duplication to contribute distinctly to different neuronal events. Our analysis reveals that APLP2 is significantly diverged from APP and APLP1.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides into fibrils has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a result, in recent years, substantial efforts have been expended in the study of the mechanism of aggregation of the Abeta peptide as well as of its inhibition by potential drug molecules. In this context, we have built a model of the Abeta(17-42) deca-oligomer using the solid-state NMR (ssNMR) structure of the Abeta(17-42) penta-oligomer as a reference. Both the penta- and deca-oligomer systems have been studied by all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and used as target systems for the investigation of the mechanism of action of a trehalose-derived Abeta aggregation inhibitor. In the deca-oligomer all the main structural features of the putative fibrillar state are retained. Moreover, the simulations reveal a remarkable gain in stability as the oligomer grows. MD studies of the inhibitor in complex with the penta- and deca-oligomers indicate a significant destabilization of the structure beyond the hampering of the addition of successive Abeta peptides at the ends of the fibril due to the presence of the inhibitor molecule. Our work provides an easy and effective approach which could be useful for the in silico development of potential drug molecules acting at different stages of the progression of Abeta-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Transgenic mice are a valuable tool in the investigation of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The triple transgenic mouse (3xTg-AD) is a model of Alzheimer's disease that possesses age-related amyloid beta plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and cell death as well as cognitive decline. Because maternal effects may interact with pup genotype in determining behavior phenotypes, we used a cross-fostering paradigm to investigate the effects of maternal genotype on behavioral development of the 3xTg-AD mouse model and its wildtype control (B6129S1F2) from 2 to 24 days of age. Developmental patterns of behavior were influenced by both pup and maternal genotype. The 3xTg-AD mice were delayed in sensory reflexes, showed less activity and poorer habituation to a novel object, but showed advanced development of motor reflexes compared to wildtype pups. While there were no differences in levels of maternal care between transgenic and control mothers, maternal genotype affected the development of several pup reflexes (body weight, hindlimb grasp reflex, loss of crossed extensor reflex, vibrissae response, righting reflex) and the number of horizontal and vertical beam breaks in an open field. This study is the first to examine neurobehavioral development and maternal behavior in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, and highlights the importance of investigating the consequences of early environmental experience as well as genetic manipulation on behavioral development.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postmortem studies have indicated the potential of high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize amyloid depositions in the cerebral cortex. The aim of this study is to test this hypothesis in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: T2*-weighted MRI was performed in 16 AD patients and 15 control subjects. All magnetic resonance images were scored qualitatively by visual assessment, and quantitatively by measuring phase shifts in the cortical gray matter and hippocampus. Statistical analysis was performed to assess differences between groups. RESULTS: Patients with AD demonstrated an increased phase shift in the cortex in the temporoparietal, frontal, and parietal regions (P < .005), and this was associated with individual Mini-Mental State Examination scores (r = -0.54, P < .05). CONCLUSION: Increased cortical phase shift in AD patients demonstrated on 7-tesla T2*-weighted MRI is a potential new biomarker for AD, which may reflect amyloid pathology in the early stages.",

    "title": "Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of the relationship between Abeta deposition, cortical thickness, and memory in cognitively unimpaired individuals and in Alzheimer disease.",
    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer disease. Abeta deposition accelerates gray matter atrophy at early stages of the disease even before objective cognitive impairment is manifested. Identification of at-risk individuals at the presymptomatic stage has become a major research interest because it will allow early therapeutic interventions before irreversible synaptic and neuronal loss occur. We aimed to further characterize the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationship between Abeta deposition, gray matter atrophy, and cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the topographical relationship of Abeta deposition, gray matter atrophy, and memory impairment in asymptomatic individuals with Alzheimer disease pathology as assessed by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET). DESIGN: Regional analysis was performed on the cortical surface to relate cortical thickness to PiB retention and episodic memory. SETTING: The Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle Study of Aging, Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-three healthy elderly control subjects (NCs) and 40 patients with Alzheimer disease from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle Study of Aging cohort. INTERVENTION: Participants underwent neuropsychological evaluation as well as magnetic resonance imaging and PiB-PET scans. Fifty-four NCs underwent repeated scans and neuropsychological evaluation 18 and 36 months later. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Correlations between cortical thickness, PiB retention, and episodic memory. RESULTS There was a significant reduction in cortical thickness in the precuneus and hippocampus associated with episodic memory impairment in the NC PiB-positive (NC+) group when compared with the NC- group. Cortical thickness was also correlated negatively with neocortical PiB in the NC+ group. Longitudinal analysis showed a faster rate of gray matter (GM) atrophy in the temporal lobe and the hippocampi of the NC+ group. Over time, GM atrophy became more extensive in the NC+ group, especially in the temporal lobe. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In asymptomatic individuals, Abeta deposition is associated with GM atrophy and memory impairment. The earliest signs of GM atrophy were detected in the hippocampus and the posterior cingulate and precuneus regions, and with disease progression, atrophy became more extensive in the temporal lobes. These findings support the notion that Abeta deposition is not a benign process and that interventions with anti-Abeta therapy at these early stages have a higher chance to be effective.",

However, previous studies used multiple sequential purification steps to isolate the isoforms individually and quantitate them based on a common mid-domain peptide. We created a method to simultaneously purify Abeta isoforms and quantitate them by the specific C-terminal peptides in order to investigate Abeta isoform physiology in the central nervous system. By using standards generated from in vitro metabolic labeling, the relative quantitation of four peptides representing total amount of Abeta (Abeta-Total), Abeta38, Abeta40, and Abeta42 were achieved both in cell culture and in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Standard curves for each isoform demonstrated good sensitivity with very low limits of detection and high accuracy. Because the assay does not require antibody development for each Abeta isoform peptide, significant improvements in the throughput and accuracy of isoform quantitation were achieved.",

Significantly, abnormalities induced by aggregated Abeta have been linked to synaptic and neuritic degeneration, consistent with the \"dying-back\" pattern of degeneration that characterizes neurons affected in AD. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the toxic effect of aggregated Abeta remain elusive. In the last 2 decades, a variety of aggregated Abeta species have been identified and their toxic properties demonstrated in diverse experimental systems. Concurrently, specific Abeta assemblies have been shown to interact and misregulate a growing number of molecular effectors with diverse physiological functions. Such pleiotropic effects of aggregated Abeta posit a mayor challenge for the identification of the most cardinal Abeta effectors relevant to AD pathology. In this review, we discuss recent experimental evidence implicating amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) as a molecular target for toxic Abeta assemblies. Based on a significant body of pathologic observations and experimental evidence, we propose a novel pathologic feed-forward mechanism linking Abeta aggregation to abnormalities in APP processing and function, which in turn would trigger the progressive loss of neuronal connectivity observed early in AD.",

Thirty male SD rats were randomly divided into control group, AD model group and triptolide-treated group. The AD model group was made with bilateral microinjection of aggregated beta-amyloid protein (Abeta)1-40 into hippocampus in rats and the control group rats were injected with normal saline in the same way. The triptolide-treated group rats were administered triptolide intraperitoneally for 30 days after microinjection of aggregated Abeta1-40 into hippocampus. Dendritic morphology of hippocampal neurons in each group was analyzed using Golgi staining and ImageJ software. Our data showed that the total number of intersection points of dendrites and spine density in hippocampal neurons in the AD model group were decreased as compared with the control group. However, the total number of intersection points of dendrites and spine density in hippocampal neurons in the triptolide-treated group were increased as compared with the AD model group.

    "abstract": "A fascinating yet perhaps overlooked trait of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) is its ability to bind ligands with no obvious neurotrophic function. Using cultured basal forebrain (BF) neurons, this study demonstrates selective internalization of amyloid beta (Abeta) 1-42 in conjunction with p75(NTR) (labelled with IgG192-Cy3) by cholinergic cells. Active under resting conditions, this process was enhanced by high K(+) stimulation and was insensitive to inhibitors of regulated synaptic activity-tetrodotoxin or botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT type/A and/B). Blockade of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum (SERCA) Ca(2+) ATPase with thapsigargin and CPA or chelation of Ca(2+) with EGTA-AM strongly suppressed the endocytosis of p75(NTR), implicating the role of ER released Ca(2+). The uptake of IgG192-Cy3 was also reduced by T-type Ca(2+) channel blocker mibefradil but not Cd(2+), an indiscriminate blocker of high voltage-activated Ca(2+) currents. A strong co-localization of IgG192-Cy3 with late endosome (Rab7) or lysosome (Lamp1) qualifier proteins suggest these compartments as the primary destination for internalized IgG192 and Abeta. Selective uptake and labeling of BF cholinergic cells with IgG192-Cy3 injected into the prefrontal cortex was verified also in vivo. The significance of these findings in relation to Abeta clearance in the cerebral cortex and pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease is discussed.",

    "abstract": "S-Nitrosylation is a redox-mediated posttranslational modification that regulates protein function via covalent reaction of nitric oxide (NO)-related species with a cysteine thiol group on the target protein. Under physiological conditions, S-nitrosylation can be an important modulator of signal transduction pathways, akin to phosphorylation. However, with aging or environmental toxins that generate excessive NO, aberrant S-nitrosylation reactions can occur and affect protein misfolding, mitochondrial fragmentation, synaptic function, apoptosis or autophagy. Here, we discuss how aberrantly S-nitrosylated proteins (SNO-proteins) play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Insight into the pathophysiological role of aberrant S-nitrosylation pathways will enhance our understanding of molecular mechanisms leading to neurodegenerative diseases and point to potential therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress and amyloid-beta (Abeta) formation are important processes that occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid formation is associated with the aggregation and precipitation of the Abeta peptide, while oxidative stress results from an imbalance in pro-oxidant/antioxidant homeostasis that produces harmful reactive oxygen species. The methionine-35 (Met35) residue of the Abeta peptide plays an important role in AD oxidative stress events and the associated neurotoxicity. We and other research groups previously demonstrated that in vitro oxidation of the Met35 side-chain to the sulfoxide (Met35red   Met35ox) impedes assembly and aggregation of monomeric Abeta peptide into protofibrils, the latter being the immediate precursors of amyloid plaques. Here, we report that Met35 oxidation state affects the stability of preexisting amyloid fibrils and plaques, where the Met35red   Met35ox process leads to changes in the morphology of filaments, protofibrils, mature fibrils, and loss of Congo red birefringence in senile plaques isolated from the brains of AD patients. The most notable differences were in fibril flexibility, as evidenced by changes from straight fibrils to irregularly shaped, rope-like fibrils. These findings suggest that the Met35 oxidation state and amyloid plaque formation may be intimately linked.",

Lastly, studies of the mechanism of tau fibril formation are reviewed, and the physiological significance of these studies with reference to how they can clarify many aspects of disease progression is described. The aim of this review is to underscore how mechanistic studies reveal the complexity of the tau fibril formation pathway and the plethora of species populated on or off the pathway of aggregation, and how this information can be beneficial in the design of inhibitors or drugs that ameliorate neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Here, we tried to elucidate the possible role of autophagy against H2O2 and Amyloid beta (Abeta) induced neurotoxicity using retinoic acid differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. We found that H2O2 disrupted neurite outgrowth concomitant with production of Abeta. Furthermore, we showed that H2O2 could increase the apoptotic factors such as Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, caspase-3 level, and PARP activity in a time course manner. These findings were confirmed by acridine orange/ethidium bromide and Hoechst staining. In addition, we observed that H2O2 led to conversion of LC3 protein from LC3I to LC3II and an increase in autophagy flux. Autophagy factors including LC3B, Atg7, and Atg12 increased and reached their highest level after 2h of insulting and then dropped to a lower level. Our results showed that autophagy could internalize and degrade intra- and extracellular Abeta after 3h treatment with H2O2. However, the remaining amount of Abeta accelerated morphological atrophy and, as a result, increased neuronal death (apoptosis). Inhibition of autophagy influx, using 3-methyl-adenine, increased intra- and extracellular levels of Abeta, providing more proof for a protective role of autophagy against oxidative stress. Further studies can shed light on the important role of autophagy by finding new pathways involved in Abeta degeneration.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the gene encoding the regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 2B (PPP3R1, rs1868402) and the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT, rs3785883) gene were recently associated with higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau levels in samples from the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University (WU) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In these same samples, these SNPs were also associated with faster functional decline, or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes scores (CDR-sb). We attempted to validate the latter association in an independent, population-based sample of incident AD cases from the Cache County Dementia Progression Study (DPS). METHODS: All 92 AD cases from the DPS with a global CDR-sb <=1 (mild) at initial clinical assessment who were later assessed on CDR-sb data on at least two other time points were genotyped at the two SNPs of interest (rs1868402 and rs3785883). We used linear mixed models to estimate associations between these SNPs and CDR-sb trajectory. All analyses were performed using Proc Mixed in SAS. RESULTS: Although we observed no association between rs3785883 or rs1868402 alone and change in CDR-sb (P > .10), there was a significant association between a combined genotype model and change in CDR-sb: carriers of the high-risk genotypes at both loci progressed >2.9 times faster than noncarriers (P = .015). When data from DPS were combined with previously published data from WU and ADNI, change in CDR-sb was 30% faster for each copy of the high-risk allele at rs3785883 (P = .0082) and carriers of both high-risk genotypes at both loci progressed 6 times faster (P < .0001) than all others combined. CONCLUSIONS: We replicate a previous report by Cruchaga et al that specific variations in rs3785883 and rs1868402 are associated with accelerated progression of AD. Further characterization of this association will provide a better understanding of how genetic factors influence the rate of progression of AD and could provide novel insights into preventative and therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neurodegenerative disease that occurs among the aging population and is associated with impaired cognitive function. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers initiate the pathological cascade and represent a neuropathic hallmark of AD. Therefore, an approach that inhibits Abeta aggregation is an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD. Ferulic acid (FA) is a phenolic compound that can inhibit Abeta42 fibril-induced cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. However, few studies have demonstrated that FA interacts with Abeta42 oligomers. Here, we investigated whether FA inhibits Abeta42 oligomer-induced cytotoxicity and the effect of FA on Abeta aggregation. Our results showed that FA reduced Abeta42-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, using CD spectroscopy, we found that FA inhibited the formation of the beta-sheets that are required for the Abeta42 monomer-to-oligomer transition but accelerated the Abeta42 oligomer-to-fibril transition. These phenomena were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and thioflavin T fluorescence assay. The docking analysis between FA and Abeta42 monomer showed that FA may inhibit the aggregation of Abeta42 oligomers by blocking the hydrogen bond with the forming beta-sheets. Taken together, we have identified a novel phenomenon in which FA inhibits the formation of Abeta42 oligomers while accelerating the transition of Abeta42 oligomers to fibrils, and we have shown that FA protects against Abeta42-induced toxicity in vitro by preventing Abeta42 from forming oligomers.",

Two promising candidates with respect to MHC II restriction were selected, and two transgenic mouse models of AD, P301S (H-2(b/) (k) ) and Tg2576 (H-2(b/) (s) ) animals, were immunized with one B-cell epitope in combination with two T-cell epitopes. Responders displayed an enhanced immune response compared with wild-type animals, which supports the vaccine design and the vaccination strategy. The immune response was also characterized by specific IgG subtype titers, which revealed a strong polarization toward the humoral pathway for immunization of phospho-Tau, whereas for both Abeta vaccines, a mixed cellular/humoral pathway response was observed. Despite the diversity and unpredictability of the immunogenicity of the peptide vaccines, all three peptide vaccine formulations appear to be promising constructs for future evaluation of their therapeutic properties.",

A substantial proportion of these individuals are affected by dementia, with major implications for the individual as well as society. Research on dementia in the oldest old is important for service planning, and the absence of dementia at this exceptional old age may serve as a model of successful ageing. This Review summarizes population-based epidemiological studies of dementia and its underlying neuropathology in nonagenarians and centenarians. The available data, although somewhat limited, show an age-specific and sex-specific profile of dementia status in very late life, resulting from a variety of neuropathologies that often co-occur. Extensive overlap in neuropathology between cognitively normal and cognitively impaired individuals is evident despite challenges to gathering data particular to this population. A complex picture is emerging of multiple pathogenetic mechanisms underlying dementia, and of the potential risk and protective factors for dementia that interact with genetics and lifestyle in normal and exceptional cognitive ageing.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) forms the amyloid-containing Lewy bodies found in the brain in Parkinson's disease. The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) reacts with alpha-syn to form SDS-resistant soluble, non-amyloid, and melanin-containing oligomers. Their toxicity is debated, as is the nature of their structure and their relation to amyloid-forming conformers of alpha-syn. The small-angle X-ray scattering technique in combination with modeling by the ensemble optimization method showed that the un-reacted native protein populated three broad classes of conformer, while reaction with DA gave a restricted ensemble range suggesting that the rigid melanin molecule played an important part in their structure. We found that 6 M guanidine hydrochloride did not dissociate alpha-syn DA-reacted dimers and trimers, suggesting covalent linkages. The pathological significance of covalent association is that if they are non-toxic, the oligomers would act as a sink for toxic excess DA and alpha-syn; if toxic, their stability could enhance their toxicity. We argue it is essential, therefore, to resolve the question of whether they are toxic or not.",

    "abstract": "Bath application of 200 nM amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta) to rat hippocampal slices impairs induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) of the population spike in pyramidal layer of the CA1 field of the hippocampus. Intraperitoneal injection of mitochondria-targeted plastoquinone derivative SkQ1 at very low concentrations (250 nmol/kg body weight) given 24 h before the slice preparation or 1 h treatment of hippocampal slices with 250 nM SkQ1 prevents the deleterious effect of Abeta on LTP. To elucidate which part of the molecule is responsible for this type of neuroprotective activity, the effect of the analog of SkQ1 lacking plastoquinone (C12TPP) was studied. It was found that C12TPP was much less efficient in LTP protection than SkQ1 itself. It means that the plastoquinone part of the SkQ1 molecule is responsible for the LTP rescue. To summarize, in vivo and in vitro injection of SkQ1 compensates for Abeta-induced oxidative damage of long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, which is considered to be the main reason of memory loss and impairment of other cognitive functions associated with Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, SkQ1 may be considered as a promising candidate for the treatment of early-stage Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Lack of reliable evidence for a distinctive epsilon4-related cognitive phenotype that is independent from clinical diagnostic status: findings from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study.",
    "abstract": "Individuals who carry the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 polymorphism have an increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. However, because possession of the epsilon4 allele confers an increased risk for the diagnosis of dementia, it has proven problematic in older individuals to dissociate the influence of epsilon4 on cognitive capacity per se as distinct from its influence on clinical diagnostic status. We report a statistical approach that attempts to partial out the influence of diagnostic group membership (Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, healthy control) from the influence of apolipoprotein epsilon4 genetic status on cognitive functioning. The cognitive phenotype hypothesis predicts that epsilon4-positive individuals will show cognitive deficits (relative to matched epsilon4-negative individuals) independent of the development of Alzheimer's disease. By contrast, the prodromal/preclinical Alzheimer's disease hypothesis proposes that the effect of apolipoprotein E status on cognitive performance is a function of the increased risk of dementia in individuals with the epsilon4 allele. We evaluated these hypotheses in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle cohort (n = 1112). We first determined whether previously reported findings concerning epsilon4 status and age-related neuropsychological performance could be explained by the inadvertent recruitment of people with mild cognitive impairment into the healthy control group. We then tested each diagnostic group in isolation to identify any neuropsychological patterns that may be attributed to the epsilon4 allele. Finally, as interactions between the epsilon4 allele and age have previously been reported in cognitive functioning within healthy elderly populations, we attempted to determine whether the inclusion of mild cognitively impaired individuals in the sample may drive this relationship. An extensive battery of standardized, well-validated neuropsychological tasks was administered to a final sample of 764 healthy control subjects, 131 individuals with mild cognitive impairment and 168 individuals with Alzheimer's disease. The effect of the epsilon4 allele on cognitive performance was assessed using a statistical mediation analysis and supplemented with Bayesian methods to address a number of the limitations associated with Fisherian/Neyman-Pearsonian significance testing. Our findings support the prodromal/preclinical Alzheimer's disease hypothesis and do not support the concept of a distinctive epsilon4-related cognitive phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Brain accumulation of soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaOs) has been implicated in synapse failure and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether and how oligomers of different sizes induce synapse dysfunction is a matter of controversy. Here, we report that low-molecular-weight (LMW) and high-molecular-weight (HMW) Abeta oligomers differentially impact synapses and memory. A single intracerebroventricular injection of LMW AbetaOs (10 pmol) induced rapid and persistent cognitive impairment in mice. On the other hand, memory deficit induced by HMW AbetaOs (10 pmol) was found to be reversible. While memory impairment in LMW oligomer-injected mice was associated with decreased hippocampal synaptophysin and GluN2B immunoreactivities, synaptic pathology was not detected in the hippocampi of HMW oligomer-injected mice. On the other hand, HMW oligomers, but not LMW oligomers, induced oxidative stress in hippocampal neurons. Memantine rescued both neuronal oxidative stress and the transient memory impairment caused by HMW oligomers, but did not prevent the persistent cognitive deficit induced by LMW oligomers. Results establish that different Abeta oligomer assemblies act in an orchestrated manner, inducing different pathologies and leading to synapse dysfunction. Furthermore, results suggest a mechanistic explanation for the limited efficacy of memantine in preventing memory loss in AD.",

    "abstract": "Gammagard IVIg is a therapeutic approach to treat Alzheimer's disease currently in phase 3 clinical trials. Despite the reported efficacy of the approach the mechanism of action is poorly understood. We have previously shown that intracranial injection of anti-Abeta antibodies into the frontal cortex and hippocampus reveals important information regarding the time course of events once the agent is in the brain. In the current study we compared IVIg, mouse-pooled IgG, and the anti-Abeta antibody 6E10 injected intracranially into the frontal cortex and hippocampus of 7-month-old APP/PS1 mice. We established a time course of events ranging from 1 to 21 d postinjection. IVIg and pooled mouse IgG both significantly reduced Abeta deposition to the same degree as the 6E10 anti-Abeta antibody; however, the clearance was much slower to occur, happening between the 3 and 7 d time points. In contrast, as we have previously shown, Abeta reductions were apparent with the 6E10 anti-Abeta group at the 1 d time point. Also, neuroinflammatory profiles were significantly altered by the antibody treatments. APP/PS1 transgenic mice at 7 months of age typically exhibit an M2a inflammatory phenotype. All antibody treatments stimulated an M2b response, yet anti-Abeta antibody was a more rapid change. Because the neuroinflammatory switch occurs before the detectable reductions in amyloid deposition, we hypothesize that the IVIg and pooled mouse IgG act as immune modulators and this immune modulation is responsible for the reductions in amyloid pathology.",

    "title": "Implementation and validation of an adaptive template registration method for 18F-flutemetamol imaging data.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The spatial normalization of PET amyloid imaging data is challenging because different white and gray matter patterns of negative (Abeta-) and positive (Abeta+) uptake could lead to systematic bias if a standard method is used. In this study, we propose the use of an adaptive template registration method to overcome this problem. METHODS: Data from a phase II study (n = 72) were used to model amyloid deposition with the investigational PET imaging agent (18)F-flutemetamol. Linear regression of voxel intensities on the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in a neocortical composite region for all scans gave an intercept image and a slope image. We devised a method where an adaptive template image spanning the uptake range (the most Abeta- to the most Abeta+ image) can be generated through a linear combination of these 2 images and where the optimal template is selected as part of the registration process. We applied the method to the (18)F-flutemetamol phase II data using a fixed volume of interest atlas to compute SUVRs. Validation was performed in several steps. The PET-only adaptive template registration method and the MR imaging-based method used in statistical parametric mapping were applied to spatially normalize PET and MR scans, respectively. Resulting transformations were applied to coregistered gray matter probability maps, and the quality of the registrations was assessed visually and quantitatively. For comparison of quantification results with an independent patient-space method, FreeSurfer was used to segment each subject's MR scan and the parcellations were applied to the coregistered PET scans. We then correlated SUVRs for a composite neocortical region obtained with both methods. Furthermore, to investigate whether the (18)F-flutemetamol model could be generalized to (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PIB), we applied the method to Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) (11)C-PIB scans (n = 285) and compared the PET-only neocortical composite score with the corresponding score obtained with a semimanual method that made use of the subject's MR images for the positioning of regions. RESULTS: Spatial normalization was successful on all scans. Visual and quantitative comparison of the new PET-only method with the MR imaging-based method of statistical parametric mapping indicated that performance was similar in the cortical regions although the new PET-only method showed better registration in the cerebellum and pons reference region area. For the (18)F-flutemetamol quantification, there was a strong correlation between the PET-only and FreeSurfer SUVRs (Pearson r = 0.96). We obtained a similar correlation for the AIBL (11)C-PIB data (Pearson r = 0.94). CONCLUSION: The derived adaptive template registration method allows for robust, accurate, and fully automated quantification of uptake for (18)F-flutemetamol and (11)C-PIB scans without the use of MR imaging data.",

    "title": "The amyloid precursor protein (APP) triplicated gene impairs neuronal precursor differentiation and neurite development through two different domains in the Ts65Dn mouse model for Down syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Intellectual disability in Down syndrome (DS) appears to be related to severe proliferation impairment during brain development. Recent evidence shows that it is not only cellular proliferation that is heavily compromised in DS, but also cell fate specification and dendritic maturation. The amyloid precursor protein (APP), a gene that is triplicated in DS, plays a key role in normal brain development by influencing neural precursor cell proliferation, cell fate specification, and neuronal maturation. APP influences these processes via two separate domains, the APP intracellular domain (AICD) and the soluble secreted APP. We recently found that the proliferation impairment of neuronal precursors (NPCs) from the Ts65Dn mouse model for DS was caused by derangement of the Shh pathway due to overexpression of patched1(Ptch1), its inhibitory regulator. Ptch1 overexpression was related to increased levels within the APP/AICD system. The overall goal of this study was to determine whether APP contributes to neurogenesis impairment in DS by influencing in addition to proliferation, cell fate specification, and neurite development. We found that normalization of APP expression restored the reduced neuronogenesis, the increased astrogliogenesis, and the reduced neurite length of trisomic NPCs, indicating that APP overexpression underpins all aspects of neurogenesis impairment. Moreover, we found that two different domains of APP impair neuronal differentiation and maturation in trisomic NPCs. The APP/AICD system regulates neuronogenesis and neurite length through the Shh pathway, whereas the APP/secreted AP system promotes astrogliogenesis through an IL-6-associated signaling cascade. These results provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying brain development alterations in DS.",

    "abstract": "Microglia can exacerbate central nervous system disorders, including stroke and chronic progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease. Mounting evidence points to ion channels expressed by microglia as contributing to these neuropathologies. The Chloride Intracellular Channel (CLIC) family represents a class of chloride intracellular channel proteins, most of which are localized to intracellular membranes. CLICs are unusual in that they possess both soluble and integral membrane forms. Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) accumulation in plaques is a hallmark of familial Alzheimer disease. The truncated Abeta25-35 species was shown previously to increase the expression of CLIC1 chloride conductance in cortical microglia and to provoke microglial neurotoxicity. However, the highly pathogenic and fibrillogenic full-length Abeta1-42 species was not examined, nor was the potential role of CLIC1 in mediating microglial activation and neurotoxicity by other stimuli (e.g. ligands for the Toll-like receptors). In the present study, we utilized a two chamber Transwell  cell culture system to allow separate treatment of microglia and neurons while examining the effect of pharmacological blockade of CLIC1 in protecting cortical neurons from toxicity caused by Abeta1-42- and lipopolysaccaride-stimulated microglia. Presentation of Abeta1-42 to the upper, microglia-containing chamber resulted in a progressive loss of neurons over 3 days. Neuronal cell injury was prevented by the CLIC1 ion channel blockers IAA-94 [(R(+)-[(6,7-dichloro-2-cyclopentyl-2,3-dihydro-2-methyl-1-oxo-1H-inden-5yl)-oxy] acetic acid)] and niflumic acid (2-{[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]amino}nicotinic acid) when presented to the upper chamber only. Incubation of microglia with lipopolysaccharide plus interferon-gamma led to neuronal cell injury which, however, was insensitive to inhibition by the CLIC1 channel blockers, suggesting a degree of selectivity in agents leading to CLIC1 activation.",

    "title": "Antibodies bound to Abeta oligomers potentiate the neurotoxicity of Abeta by activating microglia.",
    "abstract": "Beta amyloid (Abeta) oligomers are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. However, clinical trials using Abeta immunization were unsuccessful due to strong brain inflammation, the mechanisms of which are poorly understood. In this study we tested whether monoclonal antibodies to oligomeric Abeta would prevent the neurotoxicity of Abeta oligomers in primary neuronal-glial cultures. However, surprisingly,the antibodies dramatically increased the neurotoxicity of Abeta. Antibodies bound to monomeric Abeta fragments were non-toxic to cultured neurons, while antibodies to other oligomeric proteins: hamster polyomavirus major capsid protein, human metapneumovirus nucleocapsid protein, and measles virus nucleocapsid protein, strongly potentiated the neurotoxicity of their antigens. The neurotoxicity of antibody-antibody oligomeric antigen complexes was abolished by removal of the Fc region from the antibodies or by removal of microglia from cultures, and was accompanied by inflammatory activation and proliferation of the microglia in culture. In conclusion, we find that immune complexes formed by Abeta oligomers or other oligomeric/multimeric antigens and their specific antibodies can cause death and loss of neurons in primary neuronal-glial cultures via Fc-dependent microglial activation. The results suggest that therapies resulting in antibodies to oligomeric Abeta or oligomeric brain virus proteins should be used with caution or with suppression of microglial activation.",

On the other side, studies on human brain specimen have elucidated that tau pathology may occur before amyloid pathology is present indicating that in principle tau pathology could also trigger Abeta aggregation. To address this question, we have crossed 5XFAD mice coexpressing human mutant APP695 with the Swedish, Florida, and London mutations and human mutant presenilin-1 (PS1) with the M146L and L286V mutations with the PS19 model overexpressing human mutant tau with the P301S mutation. The resulting triple transgenic model 5XFAD/PS19 has been characterized at 3 and 9 months of age. A dramatic aggravation of hyperphosphorylated tau pathology together with a dramatically increased inflammatory response and a loss of synapses and hippocampal CA1 neurons in aged 5XFAD/PS19 mice were observed. Extracellular amyloid deposits were unaltered. These data support the assumption of tau pathology being downstream of amyloid pathology, suggesting that both pathologies together trigger the severe neuron loss in the hippocampus in the 5XFAD/PS19 mouse model.",

    "abstract": "Cholinergic basal forebrain (BF) neurons source one of the largest modulator systems of the brain, supplying acetylcholine to the entire cerebral mantle. Ample evidence suggests a causal link between the depletion of cortical acetylcholine and the selective disruption of cognitive functions in the course of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A distinctive yet underappreciated feature of BF cholinergic neurons is their enrichment with the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)), which is also recognized as a high-affinity acceptor for the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. Herein, we critically overview the emerging data, which suggest the relevance of p75(NTR)-mediated uptake of Abeta followed by its degradation in lysosomes of BF cholinergic neurons for the homeostasis and clearance of this peptide from the cerebral cortex. We propose that via such a unique arrangement, cholinergic neurons afford their functional targets with an efficient molecular \"drain\" for Abeta. This process is suggested as the proximal cause for the greater \"wear and tear\" of the BF cholinergic system during aging and especially AD.",

    "abstract": "The 42-mer amyloid beta-protein (Abeta42) oligomers cause neurotoxicity and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously identified the toxic conformer of Abeta42 with a turn at positions 22-23 (\"toxic\" turn) to form oligomers and to induce toxicity in rat primary neurons, along with the non-toxic conformer with a turn at positions 25-26. G25P-Abeta42 and E22V-Abeta42 are non-toxic mutants that disfavor the \"toxic\" turn. Here we hypothesize that these non-toxic mutants of Abeta42 could suppress Abeta42-induced neurotoxicity, and examined their effects on the neurotoxicity, aggregation, and levels of the toxic conformer, which was evaluated by dot blotting using a monoclonal antibody (11A1) against the toxic conformer. G25P-Abeta42 and E22V-Abeta42 suppressed the neurotoxicity and aggregation of Abeta42 as well as the formation of the toxic conformer. The neurotoxicity induced by Abeta42 was also significantly reduced by the treatment of 11A1, but not of Abeta-sequence specific antibodies (6E10 and 4G8). Since recent studies indicate that Abeta oligomers contain parallel beta-sheet, the present results suggest that the non-toxic mutants of Abeta42 without the \"toxic\" turn could prevent the propagation process of the toxic conformer of Abeta42 resulting in suppression of the formation of the toxic oligomers. This could be a promising strategy for AD therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides are secreted from neurons, resulting in extracellular accumulation of Abeta and neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease. Because neuronal secretion is fundamental for the release of neurotransmitters, this study assessed the hypothesis that Abeta undergoes co-release with neurotransmitters. Model neuronal-like chromaffin cells were investigated, and results illustrate regulated, co-secretion of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) with peptide neurotransmitters (galanin, enkephalin, and NPY) and catecholamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine). Regulated secretion from chromaffin cells was stimulated by KCl depolarization and nicotine. Forskolin, stimulating cAMP, also induced co-secretion of Abeta peptides with peptide and catecholamine neurotransmitters. These data suggested the co-localization of Abeta with neurotransmitters in dense core secretory vesicles (DCSV) that store and secrete such chemical messengers. Indeed, Abeta was demonstrated to be present in DCSV with neuropeptide and catecholamine transmitters. Furthermore, the DCSV organelle contains APP and its processing proteases, beta- and gamma-secretases, that are necessary for production of Abeta. Thus, Abeta can be generated in neurotransmitter-containing DCSV. Human IMR32 neuroblastoma cells also displayed regulated secretion of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) with the galanin neurotransmitter. These findings illustrate that Abeta peptides are present in neurotransmitter-containing DCSV, and undergo co-secretion with neuropeptide and catecholamine neurotransmitters that regulate brain functions.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, starting with pyroglutamate at the third residue (pyroGlu-3 Abeta), are a major species deposited in the brain of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. Recent studies suggest that this isoform shows higher toxicity and amyloidogenecity when compared to full-length Abeta peptides. Here, we report the first comprehensive and comparative IHC evaluation of pyroGlu-3 Abeta deposition in humans and animal models. PyroGlu-3 Abeta immunoreactivity (IR) is abundant in plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy of AD and Down syndrome patients, colocalizing with general Abeta IR. PyroGlu-3 Abeta is further present in two nontransgenic mammalian models of cerebral amyloidosis, Caribbean vervets, and beagle canines. In addition, pyroGlu-3 Abeta deposition was analyzed in 12 different AD-like transgenic mouse models. In contrast to humans, all transgenic models showed general Abeta deposition preceding pyroGlu-3 Abeta deposition. The findings varied greatly among the mouse models concerning age of onset and cortical brain region. In summary, pyroGlu-3 Abeta is a major species of beta-amyloid deposited early in diffuse and focal plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in humans and nonhuman primates, whereas it is deposited later in a subset of focal and vascular amyloid in AD-like transgenic mouse models. Given the proposed decisive role of pyroGlu-3 Abeta peptides for the development of human AD pathology, this study provides insights into the usage of animal models in AD studies.",

Okadaic acid (OA), a protein phosphatase-2A inhibitor, increases tau phosphorylation, beta-amyloid deposition, and neuronal cell death, which are the pathological hallmarks of AD. To investigate the role of lysosomal activation in AD brain cells, cultured neurons were treated with OA and assessed lysosomal morphology and enzyme activity and the protective effect of cathepsin B, D, or L inhibitors. It was found that although it induced lysosomal swelling and enzyme activation, OA did not induce lysosomal rupture. While inhibition of cathepsin D and L failed to protect neurons from OA-induced cell death, CA074-Me, a cathepsin B inhibitor, conferred a protective effect. Interestingly, CA-074Me reduced amyloid precursor protein (APP) accumulation and alpha-spectrin cleavage, similar to the effect of calpain inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Caspases have critical roles in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Here we show that caspase-2 is required for the cognitive decline seen in human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice (J20). The age-related changes in behaviour and dendritic spine density observed in these mice are absent when they lack caspase-2, in spite of similar levels of amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition and inflammation. A similar degree of protection is observed in cultured hippocampal neurons lacking caspase-2, which are immune to the synaptotoxic effects of Abeta. Our studies suggest that caspase-2 is a critical mediator in the activation of the RhoA/ROCK-II signalling pathway, leading to the collapse of dendritic spines. We propose that this is controlled by an inactive caspase-2/RhoA/ROCK-II complex localized in dendrites, which dissociates in the presence of Abeta, allowing for their activation and entry in the spine. These findings directly implicate caspase-2 as key driver of synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and offer novel therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in nanotechnologies have led to wide use of nanomaterials in biomedical field. However, nanoparticles are found to interfere with protein misfolding and aggregation associated with many human diseases. It is still a controversial issue whether nanoparticles inhibit or promote protein aggregation. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulations to explore the effects of three kinds of carbon nanomaterials including graphene, carbon nanotube and C60 on the aggregation behavior of islet amyloid polypeptide fragment 22-28 (IAPP22-28). The diverse behaviors of IAPP22-28 peptides on the surfaces of carbon nanomaterials were studied. The results suggest these nanomaterials can prevent beta-sheet formation in differing degrees and further affect the aggregation of IAPP22-28. The pi-pi stacking and hydrophobic interactions are different in the interactions between peptides and different nanoparticles. The subtle differences in the interaction are due to the difference in surface curvature and area. The results demonstrate the adsorption interaction has competitive advantages over the interactions between peptides. Therefore, the fibrillation of IAPP22-28 may be inhibited at its early stage by graphene or SWCNT. Our study can not only enhance the understanding about potential effects of nanomaterials to amyloid formation, but also provide valuable information to develop potential beta-sheet formation inhibitors against type II diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Imaging fibrillar amyloid-beta deposition in the human brain in vivo by positron emission tomography has improved our understanding of the time course of amyloid-beta pathology in Alzheimer's disease. The most widely used amyloid-beta imaging tracer so far is (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B, a thioflavin derivative but other (11)C- and (18)F-labelled amyloid-beta tracers have been studied in patients with Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal control subjects. However, it has not yet been established whether different amyloid tracers bind to identical sites on amyloid-beta fibrils, offering the same ability to detect the regional amyloid-beta burden in the brains. In this study, we characterized (3)H-Pittsburgh compound B binding in autopsied brain regions from 23 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 20 control subjects (aged 50 to 88 years). The binding properties of the amyloid tracers FDDNP, AV-45, AV-1 and BF-227 were also compared with those of (3)H-Pittsburgh compound B in the frontal cortices of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Saturation binding studies revealed the presence of high- and low-affinity (3)H-Pittsburgh compound B binding sites in the frontal cortex (K(d1): 3.5 +- 1.6 nM; K(d2): 133 +- 30 nM) and hippocampus (K(d1):5.6 +- 2.2 nM; K(d2): 181 +- 132 nM) of Alzheimer's disease brains. The relative proportion of high-affinity to low-affinity sites was 6:1 in the frontal cortex and 3:1 in the hippocampus. One control showed both high- and low-affinity (3)H-Pittsburgh compound B binding sites (K(d1): 1.6 nM; K(d2): 330 nM) in the cortex while the others only had a low-affinity site (K(d2): 191 +- 70 nM). (3)H-Pittsburgh compound B binding in Alzheimer's disease brains was higher in the frontal and parietal cortices than in the caudate nucleus and hippocampus, and negligible in the cerebellum. Competitive binding studies with (3)H-Pittsburgh compound B in the frontal cortices of Alzheimer's disease brains revealed high- and low-affinity binding sites for BTA-1 (Ki: 0.2 nM, 70 nM), florbetapir (1.8 nM, 53 nM) and florbetaben (1.0 nM, 65 nM). BF-227 displaced 83% of (3)H-Pittsburgh compound B binding, mainly at a low-affinity site (311 nM), whereas FDDNP only partly displaced (40%). We propose a multiple binding site model for the amyloid tracers (binding sites 1, 2 and 3), where AV-45 (florbetapir), AV-1 (florbetaben), and Pittsburgh compound B, all show nanomolar affinity for the high-affinity site (binding site 1), as visualized by positron emission tomography. BF-227 shows mainly binding to site 3 and FDDNP shows only some binding to site 2. Different amyloid tracers may provide new insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms in the progression of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is hypothesized to be caused by an overproduction or reduced clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. Autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) caused by mutations in the presenilin (PSEN) gene have been postulated to result from increased production of Abeta42 compared to Abeta40 in the central nervous system (CNS). This has been demonstrated in rodent models of ADAD but not in human mutation carriers. We used compartmental modeling of stable isotope labeling kinetic (SILK) studies in human carriers of PSEN mutations and related noncarriers to evaluate the pathophysiological effects of PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutations on the production and turnover of Abeta isoforms. We compared these findings by mutation status and amount of fibrillar amyloid deposition as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) using the amyloid tracer Pittsburgh compound B (PIB). CNS Abeta42 to Abeta40 production rates were 24% higher in mutation carriers compared to noncarriers, and this was independent of fibrillar amyloid deposits quantified by PET PIB imaging. The fractional turnover rate of soluble Abeta42 relative to Abeta40 was 65% faster in mutation carriers and correlated with amyloid deposition, consistent with increased deposition of Abeta42 into plaques, leading to reduced recovery of Abeta42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Reversible exchange of Abeta42 peptides with preexisting unlabeled peptide was observed in the presence of plaques. These findings support the hypothesis that Abeta42 is overproduced in the CNS of humans with PSEN mutations that cause AD, and demonstrate that soluble Abeta42 turnover and exchange processes are altered in the presence of amyloid plaques, causing a reduction in Abeta42 concentrations in the CSF.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the detection rates (DRs) and false-positive rates (FPRs) in the incidental identification of trisomy 18 (T18) and trisomy 13 (T13) as part of antenatal screening for Down's syndrome (DS) using the Combined, Quadruple and Integrated test markers. METHODS: Screening marker levels on 224 T18 and 67 T13 pregnancies screened for DS were evaluated. Estimated means, standard deviations and correlation coefficients were used with published estimates for unaffected pregnancies to derive detection algorithms for the two disorders. DRs and FPRs of the algorithms were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: In T18 and T13 pregnancies first trimester nuchal translucency was raised, free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and pregnancy associated plasma protein-A reduced. In T18 pregnancies second trimester alphafetoprotein, unconjugated oestriol and free beta-hCG were reduced. In T13 pregnancies second trimester inhibin-A was raised. These markers specified T18 and T13 algorithms. The DS Combined test algorithm detected 42% of T18 and 59% of T13 (2.00% FPR); 88% and 74% by adding the T18 Combined test algorithm (2.17% FPR) and 89% and 75% by further adding the T13 Combined test algorithm (2.19% FPR). The corresponding detection rates for the Quadruple test were: 5% and 21% (2.00% FPR), 59% and 21% (2.16% FPR) and 59% and 24% (2.28% FPR), and for the Integrated test were: 40% and 60% (2.00% FPR), 92% and 68% (2.12% FPR) and 92% and 74% (2.18% FPR).[Corrected] CONCLUSIONS: Antenatal screening for DS detects about 40% of T18 and about 60% of T13 pregnancies. The addition of a T18 algorithm substantially increases the detection of both trisomies with a small increase in the FPR. The further addition of a T13 algorithm results in a small increase in the detection of T13.",

    "abstract": "Abeta, the product of APP (amyloid precursor protein), has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). beta-Site APP cleaving enzyme1 (BACE1) is the enzyme initiating the processing of the APP to Abeta peptides. Small molecule BACE1 inhibitors are expected to decrease Abeta-peptide generation and thereby reduce amyloid plaque formation in the brain, a neuropathological hallmark of AD. BACE1 inhibition thus addresses a key mechanism in AD and its potential as a therapeutic target is currently being addressed in clinical studies. Here, we report the discovery and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of BACE1 inhibitor AZ-4217, a high potency compound (IC50 160 pM in human SH-SY5Y cells) with an excellent in vivo efficacy. Central efficacy of BACE1 inhibition was observed after a single dose in C57BL/6 mice, guinea pigs, and in an APP transgenic mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis (Tg2576). Furthermore, we demonstrate that in a 1 month treatment paradigm BACE1 inhibition of Abeta production does lower amyloid deposition in 12-month-old Tg2576 mice. These results strongly support BACE1 inhibition as concretely impacting amyloid deposition and therefore potentially an important approach for therapeutic intervention in AD.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid precursor protein (APP) belongs to a family of evolutionarily conserved transmembrane glycoproteins that has been proposed to regulate multiple aspects of cell motility in the nervous system. Although APP is best known as the source of beta-amyloid fragments (Abeta) that accumulate in Alzheimer's disease, perturbations affecting normal APP signaling events may also contribute to disease progression. Previous in vitro studies showed that interactions between APP and the heterotrimeric G protein Goalpha-regulated Goalpha activity and Go-dependent apoptotic responses, independent of Abeta. However, evidence for authentic APP-Go interactions within the healthy nervous system has been lacking. To address this issue, we have used a combination of in vitro and in vivo strategies to show that endogenously expressed APP family proteins colocalize with Goalpha in both insect and mammalian nervous systems, including human brain. Using biochemical, pharmacological, and Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation assays, we have shown that insect APP (APPL) directly interacts with Goalpha in cell culture and at synaptic terminals within the insect brain, and that this interaction is regulated by Goalpha activity. We have also adapted a well characterized assay of neuronal migration in the hawkmoth Manduca to show that perturbations affecting APPL and Goalpha signaling induce the same unique pattern of ectopic, inappropriate growth and migration, analogous to defective migration patterns seen in mice lacking all APP family proteins. These results support the model that APP and its orthologs regulate conserved aspects of neuronal migration and outgrowth in the nervous system by functioning as unconventional Goalpha-coupled receptors.",

The effects of treatment with the antihypertensive propranolol on cognition and AD-related markers have been studied in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD. Propranolol, at a lower dose than that used as antihypertensive (5 mg/kg, 6 wk), attenuated cognitive impairments shown by Tg2576 mice aged 9 months in the novel object recognition and fear conditioning tests. Propranolol was also able to counteract the increases in hippocampal levels of Abeta(42) present in Tg2576 mice. This effect was accompanied by an increased expression of insulin degrading enzyme. Changes in markers of synaptic pathology, as shown by decreases in phosphorylation of Akt and in the expression of BDNF in Tg2676 mice, were also counteracted by propranolol treatment. Tau hyperphosphorylation shown by Tg2576 mice was also decreased in the hippocampus of propranolol-treated mice, an effect probably related to an increase of GSK3beta phosphorylation (inactive form) and a decreased JNK1 expression. Overall, these data further strengthen the potential of propranolol as a therapeutic agent for AD.",

BDNF Val66Met was not found to be related to rates of change in cognition or hippocampal volume in healthy adults with low Abeta. BDNF Val66Met did not relate to the amount of Abeta or to the rate of Abeta accumulation in either group. High Abeta levels coupled with Met carriage may be useful prognostic markers of accelerated cognitive decline and hippocampal degeneration in individuals in the preclinical stage of AD.",

    "abstract": "AIM: To study the conformational changes of Abeta42 and discover novel inhibitors of both Abeta42 aggregation and beta-secretase (BACE1). METHODS: A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at a microsecond level was performed to explore stable conformations of Abeta42 monomer in aqueous solution. Subsequently, structure-based virtual screening was used to search for inhibitors of both Abeta42 aggregation and BACE1. Protein purification and in vitro activity assays were performed to validate the inhibition of the compounds identified via virtual screening. RESULTS: The initial alpha-helical conformation of Abeta42, which was unstable in aqueous solution, turned into a beta-sheet mixed with a coil structure through a transient and fully random coil. The conformation of Abeta42 mainly comprising beta-sheets and coils structure was used for further virtual screening. Five compounds were identified as inhibitors for Abeta42 aggregation, and one of them, AE-848, was discovered to be a dual inhibitor of both Abeta42 aggregation and BACE1, with IC50 values of 36.95 mumol/L and 22.70 mumol/L, respectively. CONCLUSION: A helical to beta-sheet conformational change in Abeta42 occurred in a 1.8 microsecond MD simulation. The resulting beta-sheet structure of the peptide is an appropriate conformation for the virtual screening of inhibitors against Abeta42 aggregation. Five compounds were identified as inhibitors of Abeta42 aggregation by in vitro activity assays. It was particularly interesting to discover a dual inhibitor that targets both Abeta42 aggregation and BACE1, the two crucial players in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairments. Brain oscillatory activity is critical for cognitive function and is altered in AD patients. Recent evidence suggests that accumulation of soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) induces reorganization of hippocampal networks. However, whether fine changes in network activity might be present at very early stages, before Abeta overproduction, remains to be determined. We therefore assessed whether theta and gamma oscillations and their cross-frequency coupling, which are known to be essential for normal memory function, were precociously altered in the hippocampus. Electrophysiological field potential recordings were performed using complete hippocampal preparations in vitro from young transgenic CRND8 mice, a transgenic mouse model of AD. Our results indicate that a significant proportion of 1-month-old TgCRND8 mice showed robust alterations of theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling in the principal output region of the hippocampus, the subiculum. In addition we showed that, compared to controls, these mice expressed negligible levels of Abeta. Finally, these network alterations were not due to genetic factors as 15-day-old animals did not exhibit theta-gamma coupling alterations. Thus, initial alterations in hippocampal network activity arise before Abeta accumulation and may represent an early biomarker for AD.",

    "abstract": "It is well documented that neurofibrillary tangles composed of aggregated tau protein propagate in a predictable pattern in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The mechanisms underlying the propagation of tau pathology are still poorly understood. Recent studies have provided solid data demonstrating that in several neurodegenerative diseases including AD, the spreading of misfolded protein aggregates in the brain would result from prion-like cell-to-cell transmission. Consistent with this new concept, recent studies have reported that human tau can be released in the extracellular space by an active process of secretion, and can be endocytosed both in vitro and in vivo. Most importantly, it was reported that the spreading of tau pathology was observed along synaptically connected circuits in a transgenic mouse model where human tau overexpression was restricted in the entorhinal cortex. This indicates that secretion of tau by presynaptic neurons and its uptake by postsynaptic neurons could be the sequential events leading to the propagation of tau pathology in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Cleavage of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) at the Asp1 beta-secretase site of the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) domain by beta-site Abeta precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is required for the generation of Abeta, a central component of neuritic plaques in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. In this study, we found that Abeta Glu11 is the major beta-secretase site for cleavage of APP by BACE1 to generate soluble secreted APP (sAPPbeta)(606) and the C-terminal membrane-bound fragment (CTF)beta product C89. Cleavage of C89 by gamma-secretase resulted in truncated Abeta generation in a non-amyloidogenic pathway. A familial AD-associated Swedish APP mutation adjacent to Abeta Asp1 shifted the major APP beta-secretase cleavage site from Abeta Glu11 to Asp1, resulting in significant increases in sAPPbeta596 and CTFbeta C99 generation and the C99/89 ratio, in turn leading to increased Abeta production in cultured cells in vitro and transgenic AD model mouse brains in vivo. Furthermore, increased BACE1 expression facilitated APP being processed by the beta-secretase processing pathway rather than the alpha-secretase pathway, leading to more Abeta production. Our results suggest that potentiating BACE1 cleavage of APP at both the Asp1 and Glu11 sites, or shifting the cleavage from the Glu11 site to the Asp1 site, could result in increased Abeta production and facilitate neuritic plaque formation. Our study provides new insights into how alteration of BACE1 expression and beta-secretase cleavage site selection could contribute to Alzheimer pathogenesis and the pharmaceutical potential of modulating BACE1 expression and its cleavage site selection.",

    "abstract": "beta-Secretase (BACE1) cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) represents the initial step in the formation of the Alzheimer's disease associated amyloidogenic Abeta peptide. Substantive evidence indicates that APP processing by BACE1 is dependent on intracellular sorting of this enzyme. Nonetheless, knowledge of the intracellular trafficking pathway of internalised BACE1 remains in doubt. Here we show that cell surface BACE1 is rapidly internalised by the AP2/clathrin dependent pathway in transfected cells and traffics to early endosomes and Rab11-positive, juxtanuclear recycling endosomes, with very little transported to the TGN as has been previously suggested. Moreover, BACE1 is predominantly localised to the early and recycling endosome compartments in different cell types, including neuronal cells. In contrast, the majority of internalised wild-type APP traffics to late endosomes/lysosomes. To explore the relevance of the itinerary of BACE1 on APP processing, we generated a BACE1 chimera containing the cytoplasmic tail of TGN38 (BACE/TGN38), which cycles between the cell surface and TGN in an AP2-dependent manner. Wild-type BACE1 is less efficient in Abeta production than the BACE/TGN38 chimera, highlighting the relevance of the itinerary of BACE1 on APP processing. Overall the data suggests that internalised BACE1 and APP diverge at early endosomes and that Abeta biogenesis is regulated in part by the recycling itinerary of BACE1.",

Seventeen female transgenic mice (J20) were divided into the experimental (EX, n=10) and control (C, n=7) groups. In the EX group, maxillary bilateral molar teeth were extracted at the age of 6 months. In the C group, however, these teeth remained intact. Passive avoidance test was performed to evaluate learning and memory abilities right after tooth extraction (6 months old) and 4 months later (10 months old). After the test at 10 months, amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition and changes of neuronal cell number and area in the hippocampus were investigated using half of the brains. The other half was homogenized and used to determine Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels by ELISA. At the 10 months of age, learning and memory abilities were significantly impaired in the EX group compared to the C group (P<0.05). The neuronal cell number in the CA1 and CA3 regions was significantly lower in the EX group than in the C group (P<0.05). Total Abeta, Abeta40, and Abeta42 levels showed no significant intergroup difference.

In this study, male Wistar rats were used and the following groups were formed (N=6-13): (a) control, given saline solution; (b) [NMDA antagonist] MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg); (c) LiCa (350 mg/kg); (d) Abeta 25-35 (100 muM) injected into both hippocampi; and (e) Abeta 25-35+LiCa. In all cases, treatments were administered with or without reactivation of memory.

    "abstract": "Intermediate amyloidogenic states along the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) aggregation pathway have been shown to be linked to neurotoxicity. To shed more light on the different structures that may arise during Abeta aggregation, we here investigate surfactant-induced Abeta aggregation. This process leads to co-aggregates featuring a beta-structure motif that is characteristic for mature amyloid-like structures. Surfactants induce secondary structure in Abeta in a concentration-dependent manner, from predominantly random coil at low surfactant concentration, via beta-structure to the fully formed alpha-helical state at high surfactant concentration. The beta-rich state is the most aggregation-prone as monitored by thioflavin T fluorescence. Small angle x-ray scattering reveals initial globular structures of surfactant-Abeta co-aggregated oligomers and formation of elongated fibrils during a slow aggregation process. Alongside this slow (minutes to hours time scale) fibrillation process, much faster dynamic exchange (k(ex) ~1100 s(-1)) takes place between free and co-aggregate-bound peptide. The two hydrophobic segments of the peptide are directly involved in the chemical exchange and interact with the hydrophobic part of the co-aggregates. Our findings suggest a model for surfactant-induced aggregation where free peptide and surfactant initially co-aggregate to dynamic globular oligomers and eventually form elongated fibrils. When interacting with beta-structure promoting substances, such as surfactants, Abeta is kinetically driven toward an aggregation-prone state.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque deposition plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Post-mortem analysis of plaque development in mouse models of AD revealed that plaques are initially small, but then increase in size and become more numerous with age. There is evidence that plaques can grow uniformly over time; however, a complementary hypothesis of plaque development is that small plaques cluster and grow together thereby forming larger plaques. To investigate the latter hypothesis, we studied plaque formation in APPPS1 mice using in vivo two-photon microscopy and immunohistochemical analysis. We used sequential pre- and post-mortem staining techniques to label plaques at different stages of development and to detect newly emerged plaques. Post-mortem analysis revealed that a subset (22 %) of newly formed plaques appeared very close (<40 mum) to pre-existing plaques and that many close plaques (25 %) that were initially separate merged over time to form one single large plaque. Our results suggest that small plaques can cluster together, thus forming larger plaques as a complementary mechanism to simple uniform plaque growth from a single initial plaque. This study deepens our understanding of Abeta deposition and demonstrates that there are multiple mechanisms at play in plaque development.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic loss is the cardinal feature linking neuropathology to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism of synaptic damage remains incompletely understood. Here, using FRET-based glutamate sensor imaging, we show that amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) engages alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to induce release of astrocytic glutamate, which in turn activates extrasynaptic NMDA receptors (eNMDARs) on neurons. In hippocampal autapses, this eNMDAR activity is followed by reduction in evoked and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). Decreased mEPSC frequency may reflect early synaptic injury because of concurrent eNMDAR-mediated NO production, tau phosphorylation, and caspase-3 activation, each of which is implicated in spine loss. In hippocampal slices, oligomeric Abeta induces eNMDAR-mediated synaptic depression. In AD-transgenic mice compared with wild type, whole-cell recordings revealed excessive tonic eNMDAR activity accompanied by eNMDAR-sensitive loss of mEPSCs. Importantly, the improved NMDAR antagonist NitroMemantine, which selectively inhibits extrasynaptic over physiological synaptic NMDAR activity, protects synapses from Abeta-induced damage both in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "One of the primary pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's diseases (AD) is amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation and its extracellular accumulation. However, current in vitro Abeta aggregation assays require time-consuming and labor-intensive steps, which delay the process of drug discovery and understanding the mechanism of Abeta induced neurotoxicity. Here, we propose a rapid detection method for studying Abeta aggregation and inhibition under an optimized acidic perturbation condition by dual functions of gold nanoplasmonic particles (GNPs): (1) catalytic activator and (2) optical reporter. Because of roles of GNPs as effective nucleation sites for fast-catalyzing Abeta aggregation and colorimetric optical reporters for tracking Abeta aggregation, we accomplished the fast aggregation assay in less than 1 min by the naked eyes. Our detection method is based on spontaneous clustering of unconjugated (unmodified) GNPs along with the aggregated Abeta network under an aggregation-promoting condition. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we employed the acidic perturbation permitting rapid cooperative assemblies of GNPs and Abeta peptides via their surface charge modulation. Under the optimized acidic perturbation condition around pH 2 to 3, we characterized the concentration-dependent colorimetric responses for aggregation at physiologically relevant Abeta concentration levels (from 100 muM to 10 nM). We also demonstrated the GNP/acidic condition-based rapid inhibition assay of Abeta aggregation by using well-known binding reagents such as antibody and serum albumin. The proposed methodology can be a powerful alternative method for screening drugs for AD as well as studying molecular biophysics of protein aggregations, and further extended to explore other protein conformational diseases such as neurodegenerative disease.",

    "title": "Effect of apolipoprotein E genotype and diet on apolipoprotein E lipidation and amyloid peptides: randomized clinical trial.",
    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) is caused in part by decreased clearance of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide breakdown products. Lipid-depleted (LD) apolipoproteins are less effective at binding and clearing Abeta, and LD Abeta peptides are more toxic to neurons. However, not much is known about the lipid states of these proteins in human cerebrospinal fluid. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the lipidation states of Abeta peptides and apolipoprotein E in the cerebrospinal fluid in adults with respect to cognitive diagnosis and APOE epsilon4 allele carrier status and after a dietary intervention. DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Veterans Affairs Medical Center clinical research unit. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty older adults with normal cognition (mean [SD] age, 69 [7] years) and 27 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (67 [6] years). INTERVENTIONS: Randomization to a diet high in saturated fat content and with a high glycemic index (High diet; 45% of energy from fat [>25% saturated fat], 35%-40% from carbohydrates with a mean glycemic index >70, and 15%-20% from protein) or a diet low in saturated fat content and with a low glycemic index (Low diet; 25% of energy from fat [<7% saturated fat], 55%-60% from carbohydrates with a mean glycemic index <55, and 15%-20% from protein). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lipid-depleted Abeta42 and Abeta40 and apolipoprotein E in cerebrospinal fluid. RESULTS: Baseline levels of LD Abeta were greater for adults with mild cognitive impairment compared with adults with normal cognition (LD Abeta42, P = .05; LD Abeta40, P = .01). These findings were magnified in adults with mild cognitive impairment and the epsilon4 allele, who had higher LD apolipoprotein E levels irrespective of cognitive diagnosis (P < .001). The Low diet tended to decrease LD Abeta levels, whereas the High diet increased these fractions (LD Abeta42, P = .01; LD Abeta40, P = .15). Changes in LD Abeta levels with the Low diet negatively correlated with changes in cerebrospinal fluid levels of insulin (LD Abeta42 and insulin, r = -0.68 [P = .01]; LD Abeta40 and insulin, r = -0.78 [P = .002]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The lipidation states of apolipoproteins and Abeta peptides in the brain differ depending on APOE genotype and cognitive diagnosis. Concentrations can be modulated by diet. These findings may provide insight into the mechanisms through which apolipoprotein E4 and unhealthy diets impart risk for developing AD.",

Unfortunately, techniques enabling quantitative estimates of these species in patients or patient samples are still rather limited. Here we describe the in vitro and ex vivo characteristics of a new antibody-based radioactive ligand, [125I]mAb158, which binds to Abeta protofibrils with high affinity. [125I]mAb158 was specifically taken up in brain of transgenic mice expressing amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) as shown ex vivo. This was in contrast to [125I]mAb-Ly128 which does not bind to Abeta. The uptake of intraperitoneally-administered [125I]mAb158 into the brain was age- and time-dependent, and saturable in AbetaPP transgenic mice with modest Abeta deposition. Brain uptake was also found in young AbetaPP transgenic mice that were devoid of Abeta deposits, suggesting that [125I]mAb158 targets soluble Abeta protofibrils. The radioligand was diffusely located in the parenchyma, sometimes around senile plaques and only occasionally colocalized with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. A refined iodine-124-labeled version of mAb158 with much improved blood-brain barrier passage and a shorter plasma half-life might be useful for PET imaging of Abeta protofibrils.",

Male Tg+ rats were bred with female wild-type rats to generate litters of hemizygous Tg+ and Tg- offspring. Tg+ rats and Tg- littermates were tested for memory deficits at 4, 8, and 12 months old using a water-maze procedure. There were no significant behavioral differences between Tg+ rats and Tg- littermates at 4 months old but there were significant differences at 8 and 12 months old, and in probe trials at 8 and 12 months old, the Tg+ rats spent significantly less time and covered less distance in the platform zone. Under acquisition of a fixed-consecutive number schedule at 3 months old, Tg- littermates demonstrated a longer latency to learning the response rule than Tg+ rats; while this might seem paradoxical, it is consistent with the role of overexpression of AbetaPP in learning. Histological analyses revealed activated astrocytes in brains of Tg+ rats but not Tg- littermates at 6 months old, and thioflavin-S positive staining in the hippocampus and cortex of 17-month old Tg+ rats but not Tg- littermates. Quantification of Abeta load in the brain at 22 months indicated high levels of Abeta38, Abeta40, and Abeta42 in the Tg+ rats.

    "abstract": "Whereas the classical histological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are deposition of amyloid-containing plaques and development of neurofibrillary tangles, there is also clear evidence of inflammatory changes accompanied by the presence of activated microglia and astrocytosis. However, at this time, it remains uncertain whether inflammatory changes contribute to pathogenesis of the disease or if they are secondary to deposition of amyloid-beta or other pathological changes. A greater understanding of the sequence of events would clearly improve development of strategies to delay progression of the disease. There is a realistic expectation that advances in imaging technology may provide the key to uncovering this sequence. In this study, we employed non-invasive imaging techniques to examine changes in tissue state in hippocampus and cortex of transgenic mice which overexpress amyloid-beta protein precursor and presenilin 1 and show that the observed increase in T1 relaxation time was associated with astrogliosis while the decrease in T2 relaxation time was associated with microglial activation. We explored the possibility that interferon-gamma might trigger glial activation and demonstrate a genotype-related infiltration of macrophages and natural killer cells, which release interferon-gamma. The evidence suggests that IFNgamma triggers glial activation and expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and these changes, in turn, contribute to the decrease in long-term potentiation.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of fast axonal transport (FAT) is an early pathological event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaOs), increasingly recognized as proximal neurotoxins in AD, impair organelle transport in cultured neurons and transgenic mouse models. AbetaOs also stimulate hyperphosphorylation of the axonal microtubule-associated protein, tau. However, the role of tau in FAT disruption is controversial. Here we show that AbetaOs reduce vesicular transport of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampal neurons from both wild-type and tau-knockout mice, indicating that tau is not required for transport disruption. FAT inhibition is not accompanied by microtubule destabilization or neuronal death. Significantly, inhibition of calcineurin (CaN), a calcium-dependent phosphatase implicated in AD pathogenesis, rescues BDNF transport. Moreover, inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, downstream targets of CaN, prevents BDNF transport defects induced by AbetaOs. We further show that AbetaOs induce CaN activation through nonexcitotoxic calcium signaling. Results implicate CaN in FAT regulation and demonstrate that tau is not required for AbetaO-induced BDNF transport disruption.",

    "abstract": "RATIONALE: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are approved to treat the symptoms of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease by restoring acetylcholine levels at synapses where the neurotransmitter has been depleted due to neurodegeneration. This assumption is challenged by more recent clinical studies suggesting the potential for disease-modifying effects of AChEIs as well as in vitro studies showing neuroprotective effects. However, few preclinical studies have assessed whether the improvement of cognitive symptoms may be mediated by reductions in Abeta or Tau pathology. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study was to determine whether short-duration treatment with donepezil could improve spatial learning and memory in transgenic mice overexpressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) (Dewachter et al., J Neurosci 20(17):6452-6458, 2000) after amyloid pathology has fully developed, consistent with early stages of Alzheimer'sdisease in humans. In parallel, the effect of donepezil treatment on brain amyloid, Tau, and glial endpoints was measured. RESULTS: This study showed a significant improvement in reference memory in hAPP/PS1 mice along with dose-dependent reductions in brain amyloid-beta (Abeta). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the observed cognitive improvement produced by donepezil in Alzheimer's disease may be due, at least in part, to reduction of brain Abeta.",

Although the degree of stiffness of amyloid is critical to the understanding of its pathological and biological functions, current estimates of the rigidity of these beta-sheet-rich protein aggregates range from soft (10(8) Pa) to hard (10(10) Pa) depending on the method used. Here, we use time-resolved 4D EM to directly and noninvasively measure the oscillatory dynamics of freestanding, self-supporting amyloid beams and their rigidity. The dynamics of a single structure, not an ensemble, were visualized in space and time by imaging in the microscope an amyloid-dye cocrystal that, upon excitation, converts light into mechanical work. From the oscillatory motion, together with tomographic reconstructions of three studied amyloid beams, we determined the Young modulus of these highly ordered, hydrogen-bonded beta-sheet structures. We find that amyloid materials are very stiff (10(9) Pa). The potential biological relevance of the deposition of such a highly rigid biomaterial in vivo are discussed.",

The pH-dependent tetramerization and fibrillation of the central hydrophobic segment of Alzheimer amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta(12-24)) were respectively explored by all-atom replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations and by fluorescence and atomic force microscopy measurements. Our combined study shows that more beta-sheet structures in the early event of tetramerization is linked directly to the high propensity to form amyloid fibrils in the consequent fibrillation. Both tetramerization and fibrillation are strongly regulated by pH. At pH 5.0, Abeta(12-24) has two opposite terminal charges. The electrostatic attraction between the side-chains of His13/His14 and Glu22/Asp23 thus acts as a \"pattern keeper\", resulting in high propensity of amyloid formation. These results suggest that pH effects most likely by affecting the ionization properties of the Abeta(12-24) peptide. Specifically, the pH-dependent equilibrium conformational distribution of different aggregate species are well-investigated in detail.

We find that both peptides have a diverse set of secondary structure elements including turns, helices, and antiparallel and parallel beta-strands. The most significant difference in the structural ensembles of the two peptides is the type of beta-hairpins and beta-strands they populate. We find that Abeta42 forms a major antiparallel beta-hairpin involving the central hydrophobic cluster residues (16-21) with residues 29-36, compatible with known amyloid fibril forming regions, whereas Abeta40 forms an alternative but less populated antiparallel beta-hairpin between the central hydrophobic cluster and residues 9-13, that sometimes forms a beta-sheet by association with residues 35-37. Furthermore, we show that the two additional C-terminal residues of Abeta42, in particular Ile-41, directly control the differences in the beta-strand content found between the Abeta40 and Abeta42 structural ensembles. Integrating the experimental and theoretical evidence accumulated over the last decade, it is now possible to present monomeric structural ensembles of Abeta40 and Abeta42 consistent with available information that produce a plausible molecular basis for why Abeta42 exhibits greater fibrillization rates than Abeta40.",

Our biochemical analysis indicates that Bace1 processes the Ig-containing beta1 Nrg1 (IgNrg1beta1) isoform. We find that a graded reduction in IgNrg1 signal strength in vivo results in increasingly severe deficits in formation and maturation of muscle spindles, a proprioceptive organ critical for muscle coordination. Further, we show that Bace1 is required for formation and maturation of the muscle spindle. Finally, pharmacological inhibition and conditional mutagenesis in adult animals demonstrate that Bace1 and Nrg1 are essential to sustain muscle spindles and to maintain motor coordination. Our results assign to Bace1 a role in the control of coordinated movement through its regulation of muscle spindle physiology, and implicate IgNrg1-dependent processing as a molecular mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of the 42-residue amyloid beta-protein (Abeta42) is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Numerous flavonoids exhibit inhibitory activity against Abeta42 aggregation, but their mechanism remains unclear in the molecular level. Here we propose the site-specific inhibitory mechanism of (+)-taxifolin, a catechol-type flavonoid, whose 3',4'-dihydroxyl groups of the B-ring plays a critical role. Addition of sodium periodate, an oxidant, strengthened suppression of Abeta42 aggregation by (+)-taxifolin, whereas no inhibition was observed under anaerobic conditions, suggesting the inhibition to be associated with the oxidation to form o-quinone. Because formation of the Abeta42-taxifolin adduct was suggested by mass spectrometry, Abeta42 mutants substituted at Arg(5), Lys(16), and/or Lys(28) with norleucine (Nle) were prepared to identify the residues involved in the conjugate formation. (+)-Taxifolin did not suppress the aggregation of Abeta42 mutants at Lys(16) and/or Lys(28) except for the mutant at Arg(5). In addition, the aggregation of Abeta42 was inhibited by other catechol-type flavonoids, whereas that of K16Nle-Abeta42 was not. In contrast, some non-catechol-type flavonoids suppressed the aggregation of K16Nle-Abeta42 as well as Abeta42. Furthermore, interaction of (+)-taxifolin with the beta-sheet region in Abeta42 was not observed using solid-state NMR unlike curcumin of the non-catechol-type. These results demonstrate that catechol-type flavonoids could specifically suppress Abeta42 aggregation by targeting Lys residues. Although the anti-AD activity of flavonoids has been ascribed to their antioxidative activity, the mechanism that the o-quinone reacts with Lys residues of Abeta42 might be more intrinsic. The Lys residues could be targets for Alzheimer disease therapy.",

However, applications to biological solids are hampered in uniformly isotopically enriched biomacromolecules due to line broadening which yields a limited spectral resolution at cryogenic temperatures. We show here that high magnetic fields allow to overcome the broadening of resonance lines often experienced at liquid nitrogen temperatures. For a fibril sample of the Alzheimer's disease beta-amyloid peptide, we find similar line widths at low temperature and at room temperature.

Alterations in neurogenesis have been found in transgenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models, but NSC activity and neurogenesis in sporadic AD models remains to be examined. We herein describe a remarkable increase in NSC proliferation in the forebrain of SAMP8, a non-transgenic mouse strain that recapitulates the transition from healthy aging to AD. The increase in proliferation is transient, precedes AD-like symptoms such as amyloid beta 1-42 [Abeta(1-42)] increase or gliosis, and is followed by a steep decline at later stages. Interestingly, in vitro studies indicate that secreted Abeta(1-42) and PI3K signaling may account for the early boost in NSC proliferation. Our results highlight the role of soluble Abeta(1-42) peptide and PI3K in the autocrine regulation of NSCs, and further suggest that over-proliferation of NSCs before the appearance of AD pathology may underlie neurogenic failure during the age-related progression of the disease. These findings have implications for therapeutic approaches based on neurogenesis in AD.",

Nevertheless, strategies based on Abeta1-42 peptide induced encephalomyelitis and possible microhemorrhages. These outcomes were not expected from studies performed in rodents. It is critical to determine if other animal models better predict side effects of immunotherapies. Mouse lemur primates can develop amyloidosis with aging. Here we used old lemurs to study immunotherapy based on Abeta1-42 or Abeta-derivative (K6Abeta1-30). We followed anti-Abeta40 immunoglobulin G and M responses and Abeta levels in plasma. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging and histology were used to evaluate amyloidosis, neuroinflammation, vasogenic edema, microhemorrhages, and brain iron deposits. The animals responded mainly to the Abeta1-42 immunogen. This treatment induced immune response and increased Abeta levels in plasma and also microhemorrhages and iron deposits in the choroid plexus. A complementary study of untreated lemurs showed iron accumulation in the choroid plexus with normal aging. Worsening of iron accumulation is thus a potential side effect of Abeta-immunization at prodromal stages of Alzheimer's disease, and should be monitored in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Although previous studies have emphasized the vulnerability of the default mode network (DMN) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), little is known about the involvement of other functional networks and their relationship to clinical phenotype. To test whether clinicoanatomic heterogeneity in AD is driven by the involvement of specific networks, network connectivity was assessed in healthy subjects by seeding regions commonly and specifically atrophied in three clinical AD variants: early-onset AD (age at onset, <65 y; memory and executive deficits), logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (language deficits), and posterior cortical atrophy (visuospatial deficits). Four-millimeter seed regions of interest were used to obtain intrinsic connectivity maps in 131 healthy controls (age, 65.5 +- 3.5 y). Atrophy patterns in independent cohorts of AD variant patients and their correspondence to connectivity networks in controls were also assessed. The connectivity maps of commonly atrophied regions of interest support posterior DMN and precuneus network involvement across AD variants, whereas seeding regions specifically atrophied in each AD variant revealed distinct, syndrome-specific connectivity patterns. Goodness-of-fit analysis of each connectivity map with network templates showed the highest correspondence between the early-onset AD seed connectivity map and anterior salience and right executive-control networks, the logopenic aphasia seed connectivity map and the language network, and the posterior cortical atrophy seed connectivity map and the higher visual network. Connectivity maps derived from controls matched regions commonly and specifically atrophied in the patients. Our findings indicate that the posterior DMN and precuneus network are commonly affected in AD variants, whereas syndrome-specific neurodegenerative patterns are driven by the involvement of specific networks outside the DMN.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibrillary tangles, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD), are composed of paired helical filaments of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau. The accumulation of these proteinaceous aggregates in AD correlates with synaptic loss and severity of dementia. Identifying the kinases involved in the pathological phosphorylation of tau may identify novel targets for AD. We used an unbiased approach to study the effect of 352 human kinases on their ability to phosphorylate tau at epitopes associated with AD. The kinases were overexpressed together with the longest form of human tau in human neuroblastoma cells. Levels of total and phosphorylated tau (epitopes Ser(P)-202, Thr(P)-231, Ser(P)-235, and Ser(P)-396/404) were measured in cell lysates using AlphaScreen assays. GSK3alpha, GSK3beta, and MAPK13 were found to be the most active tau kinases, phosphorylating tau at all four epitopes. We further dissected the effects of GSK3alpha and GSK3beta using pharmacological and genetic tools in hTau primary cortical neurons. Pathway analysis of the kinases identified in the screen suggested mechanisms for regulation of total tau levels and tau phosphorylation; for example, kinases that affect total tau levels do so by inhibition or activation of translation. A network fishing approach with the kinase hits identified other key molecules putatively involved in tau phosphorylation pathways, including the G-protein signaling through the Ras family of GTPases (MAPK family) pathway. The findings identify novel tau kinases and novel pathways that may be relevant for AD and other tauopathies.",

In vitro studies indicated that most of the target compounds exhibit significant inhibition of self-induced beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation and Cu(II)-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation and acted as potential antioxidants and biometal chelators. In particular, compounds 5d and 10d are potential lead compounds for AD therapy (5d, IC50 = 7.56 muM and 10d, IC50 = 6.51 muM for self-induced Abeta aggregation; the oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay using fluorescein (ORAC-FL) values are 4.72 and 4.70, respectively). Moreover, these compounds are capable of disassembling the highly structured Abeta fibrils generated by self- and Cu(II)-induced Abeta aggregation. Furthermore, 5d crossed the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro and did not exhibit any acute toxicity in mice at doses of up to 2000 mg/kg. Taken together, the data indicate that 5d is a very promising lead compound for AD.",

    "abstract": "The interaction of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide with cell membranes has been shown to be influenced by Abeta conformation, membrane physicochemical properties and lipid composition. However, the effect of cholesterol and its oxidized derivatives, oxysterols, on Abeta-induced neurotoxicity to membranes is not fully understood. We employed here model membranes to investigate the localization of Abeta in membranes and the peptide-induced membrane dynamics in the presence of cholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol (7keto) or 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OH). Our results have indicated that oxysterols rendered membranes more sensitive to Abeta, in contrast to role of cholesterol in inhibiting Abeta/membrane interaction. We have demonstrated that two oxysterols had different impacts owing to distinct positions of the additional oxygen group in their structures. 7keto-containing cell-sized liposomes exhibited a high propensity toward association with Abeta, while 25OH systems were more capable of morphological changes in response to the peptide. Furthermore, we have shown that 42-amino acid Abeta (Abeta-42) pre-fibril species had higher association with membranes, and caused membrane fluctuation faster than 40-residue isoform (Abeta-40). These findings suggest the enhancing effect of oxysterols on interaction of Abeta with membranes and contribute to clarify the harmful impact of cholesterol on Abeta-induced neurotoxicity by means of its oxidation.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cortical glucose metabolism, brain amyloid beta accumulation and hippocampal atrophy imaging have all been suggested as potential biomarkers in predicting which patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will convert to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic ability of [(11)C]PIB PET, [(18)F]FDG PET and quantitative hippocampal volumes measured with MR imaging in predicting conversion to AD in patients with MCI. METHODS: The study group comprised 29 patients with MCI who underwent [(11)C]PIB PET and MR imaging. Of these, 22 also underwent [(18)F]FDG PET. All subjects were invited back for clinical evaluation after 2 years. RESULTS: During the follow-up time 17 patients had converted to AD while 12 continued to meet the criteria for MCI. The two groups did not differ in age, gender or education level, but the converter group tended to have lower MMSE and Word List learning than the nonconverter group. High [(11)C]PIB retention in the frontotemporal regions and anterior and posterior cingulate (p < 0.05) predicted conversion to AD. Also reduced [(18)F]FDG uptake in the left lateral temporal cortex (LTC) predicted conversion (p < 0.05), but quantitative hippocampal volumes did not (p > 0.1). In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis the measurements that best predicted the conversion were [(11)C]PIB retention in the lateral frontal cortex and [(18)F]FDG uptake in the left LTC. Both PET methods resulted in good sensitivity and specificity and neither was significantly superior to the other. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that [(11)C]PIB and [(18)F]FDG are superior to hippocampal volumes in predicting conversion to AD in patients with MCI.",

We use stepwise connectivity analysis of Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography images to reveal the network properties of amyloid-beta deposits in normal elderly subjects and clinical patients with Alzheimer's disease. We found that amyloid-beta accumulation in the medial temporal lobe is associated with accumulation in cortical regions such as orbitofrontal, lateral temporal and precuneus/posterior cingulate cortices in Alzheimer's disease. In normal subjects, there was a predominant association between amyloid-beta deposits in the hippocampus and the midline prefrontal/orbitofrontal regions, even in those with very low amyloid-beta burden. Moreover, the orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala nucleus and hippocampus exhibit hub properties in the amyloid-beta network that may be critical to understanding the putative spreading mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease pathology in early stages.",

Such effects are attributed to conformational transitions accessed by various types of oligomers such as steric zipper or single beta-sheet. We have studied the aggregation propensities of six NNQQNY mutants: NVVVVY, NNVVNV, NNVVNY, VIQVVY, NVVQIY, and NVQVVY in water using a combination of ion-mobility mass spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Our data show a strong correlation between the tendency to form early beta-sheet oligomers and the subsequent aggregation propensity. Our molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the stability of a steric zipper structure can enhance the propensity for fibril formation. Such stability can be attained by either hydrophobic interactions in the mutant peptide or polar side-chain interdigitations in the wild-type peptide. The overall results display only modest agreement with the aggregation propensity prediction methods such as PASTA, Zyggregator, and RosettaProfile, suggesting the need for better parametrization and model peptides for these algorithms.",

    "abstract": "There is accumulating evidence showing that lifestyle factors like diet may influence the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our previous studies suggest that a multi-nutrient diet, Fortasyn, containing nutritional precursors and cofactors for membrane synthesis, viz. docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, uridine-mono-phosphate, choline, phospholipids, folic acid, vitamins B6, B12, C, E, and selenium, has an ameliorating effect on cognitive deficits in an AD mouse model. In the present study we analyzed learning strategies and memory of 11-month-old AbetaPPswe/PS1dE9 (AbetaPP/PS1) mice in the Morris water maze (MWM) task performed after nine months of dietary intervention with a control diet or a Fortasyn diet to characterize diet-induced changes in cognitive performance. The Fortasyn diet had no significant effect on MWM task acquisition. To assess hippocampus-dependent learning, the strategies that the mice used to find the hidden platform in the MWM were analyzed using the swim path data. During the fourth day of the MWM, AbetaPP/PS1 mice on control diet more often used the non-spatial random search strategy, while on the Fortasyn diet, the transgenic animals exhibited more chaining strategy than their wild-type littermates. During the probe trial, AbetaPP/PS1 mice displayed no clear preference for the target quadrant. Notably, in both transgenic and nontransgenic mice on Fortasyn diet, the latency to reach the former platform position was decreased compared to mice on the control diet. In conclusion, this specific nutrient combination showed a tendency to improve searching behavior in AbetaPP/PS1 mice by increasing the use of a more efficient search strategy and improving their swim efficiency by decreasing the latency to reach the former platform position.",

    "title": "Tuning reactivity of diphenylpropynone derivatives with metal-associated amyloid-beta species via structural modifications.",
    "abstract": "A diphenylpropynone derivative, DPP2, has been recently demonstrated to target metal-associated amyloid-beta (metal-Abeta) species implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). DPP2 was shown to interact with metal-Abeta species and subsequently control Abeta aggregation (reactivity) in vitro; however, its cytotoxicity has limited further biological applications. In order to improve reactivity toward Abeta species and lower cytotoxicity, along with gaining an understanding of a structure-reactivity-cytotoxicity relationship, we designed, prepared, and characterized a series of small molecules (C1/C2, P1/P2, and PA1/PA2) as structurally modified DPP2 analogues. A similar metal binding site to that of DPP2 was contained in these compounds while their structures were varied to afford different interactions and reactivities with metal ions, Abeta species, and metal-Abeta species. Distinct reactivities of our chemical family toward in vitro Abeta aggregation in the absence and presence of metal ions were observed. Among our chemical series, the compound (C2) with a relatively rigid backbone and a dimethylamino group was observed to noticeably regulate both metal-free and metal-mediated Abeta aggregation to different extents. Using our compounds, cell viability was significantly improved, compared to that with DPP2. Lastly, modifications on the DPP framework maintained the structural properties for potential blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Overall, our studies demonstrated that structural variations adjacent to the metal binding site of DPP2 could govern different metal binding properties, interactions with Abeta and metal-Abeta species, reactivity toward metal-free and metal-induced Abeta aggregation, and cytotoxicity of the compounds, establishing a structure-reactivity-cytotoxicity relationship. This information could help gain insight into structural optimization for developing nontoxic chemical reagents toward targeting metal-Abeta species and modulating their reactivity in biological systems.",

Although our previous data have suggested that this assay will be useful for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, the invasive CSF sampling procedure, with associated potential complications, limits use of these samples in routine clinical practice. In this study, we have demonstrated that our ELISA can detect signals in 60% of serum samples and in 80% of CSF samples obtained from non-demented subjects. Heterophilic antibodies that are reported to be a primary confounding factor in this type of ELISA system did not affect the signals obtained. Although the levels of serum Abeta oligomers were unexpectedly high, suggesting the possible detection of non-pathological Abeta complexes associated with serum carrier proteins, they did show a significant positive correlation with the levels obtained from matched CSF samples. This correlation between CSF and serum Abeta oligomer levels implies that the levels of serum Abeta oligomers measured with our ELISA might be useful as a marker for AD that reflects an intact system of Abeta transport across the blood brain barrier.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides are a primary component of fibrils and oligomers implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the intrinsic flexibility of these peptides has frustrated efforts to investigate the secondary and tertiary structure of Abeta monomers, whose conformational landscapes directly contribute to the kinetics and thermodynamics of Abeta aggregation. In this work, de novo replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations on the microseconds-per-replica timescale are used to characterize the structural ensembles of Abeta42, Abeta40, and M35-oxidized Abeta42, three physiologically relevant isoforms with substantially different aggregation properties. J-coupling data calculated from the REMD trajectories were compared to corresponding NMR-derived values acquired through two different pulse sequences, revealing that all simulations converge on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds-per-replica toward ensembles that yield good agreement with experiment. Though all three Abeta species adopt highly heterogeneous ensembles, these are considerably more structured compared to simulations on shorter timescales. Prominent in the C-terminus are antiparallel beta-hairpins between L17-A21, A30-L36, and V39-I41, similar to oligomer and fibril intrapeptide models that expose these hydrophobic side chains to solvent and may serve as hotspots for self-association. Compared to reduced Abeta42, the absence of a second beta-hairpin in Abeta40 and the sampling of alternate beta topologies by M35-oxidized Abeta42 may explain the reduced aggregation rates of these forms. A persistent V24-K28 bend motif, observed in all three species, is stabilized by buried backbone to side-chain hydrogen bonds with D23 and a cross-region salt bridge between E22 and K28, highlighting the role of the familial AD-linked E22 and D23 residues in Abeta monomer folding. These characterizations help illustrate the conformational landscapes of Abeta monomers at atomic resolution and provide insight into the early stages of Abeta aggregation pathways.",

To clarify this issue, we analyzed the longitudinal CSF tau and Abeta biomarker data from 142 of the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study subjects [18 AD, 74 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 50 cognitively normal subjects (CN)]. Yearly follow-up CSF collections and studies were conducted for up to 48 months (median = 36 months) for CSF Abeta1-42, phosphorylated tau (p-tau181), and total tau (t-tau). An unsupervised analysis of longitudinal measurements revealed that for Abeta1-42 and p-tau181 biomarkers there was a group of subjects with stable longitudinal CSF biomarkers measures and a group of subjects who showed a decrease (Abeta1-42, mean = -9.2 pg/ml/year) or increase (p-tau181, mean = 5.1 pg/ml/year) of these biomarker values. Low baseline Abeta1-42 values were associated with longitudinal increases in p-tau181. Conversely, high baseline p-tau181 values were not associated with changes in Abeta1-42 levels. When the subjects with normal baseline biomarkers and stable concentrations during follow-up were excluded, the expected time to reach abnormal CSF levels and the mean AD values was significantly shortened. Thus, our data demonstrate for the first time that there are distinct populations of ADNI subjects with abnormal longitudinal changes in CSF p-tau181 and Abeta1-42 levels, and our longitudinal results favor the hypothesis that Abeta1-42 changes precede p-tau181 changes.",

    "abstract": "Beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta), a major protein component of senile plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), is also directly neurotoxic. Mitigation of Abeta-induced neurotoxicity is thus a possible therapeutic approach to delay or prevent onset and progression of AD. This study evaluated the protective effect of Bajijiasu (beta- D-fructofuranosyl (2-2) beta- D-fructofuranosyl), a dimeric fructose isolated from the Chinese herb Radix Morinda officinalis, on Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Bajijiasu alone had no endogenous neurotoxicity up to 200 muM. Brief pretreatment with 10-40 muM Bajijiasu (2 h) significantly reversed the reduction in cell viability induced by subsequent 24 h exposure to Abeta25-35 (21 muM) as measured by MTT and LDH assays, and reduced Abeta25-35-induced apoptosis as indicated by reduced annexin V-EGFP staining. Bajijiasu also decreased the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species and the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde in PC12 cells, upregulated expression of glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase, prevented depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Psim), and blocked Abeta25-35-induced increases in [Ca(2+)] i . Furthermore, Bajijiasu reversed Abeta25-35-induced changes in the expression levels of p21, CDK4, E2F1, Bax, NF-kappaB p65, and caspase-3. Bajijiasu is neuroprotective against Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells, likely by protecting against oxidative stress and ensuing apoptosis.",

We here compared the protection induced by two EPO formulations in a rodent model of Alzheimer's disease (AD): rHu-EPO and a low sialic form, Neuro-EPO. We used the intracerebroventricular administration of aggregated Abeta25-35 peptide, a non-transgenic AD model. rHu-EPO was tested at 125-500 microg/kg intraperitoneally and Neuro-EPO at 62-250 microg/kg intranasally (IN). Behavioural procedures included spontaneous alternation, passive avoidance, water-maze and object recognition, to address spatial and non-spatial, short- and long-term memories. Biochemical markers of Abeta25-35 toxicity in the mouse hippocampus were examined and cell loss in the CA1 layer was determined. rHu-EPO and Neuro-EPO led to a significant prevention of Abeta25-35-induced learning deficits. Both EPO formulations prevented the induction of lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus, showing an antioxidant activity. rHu-EPO (250 microg/kg) or Neuro-EPO (125 microg/kg) prevented the Abeta25-35-induced increase in Bax level, TNFalpha and IL-1beta production and decrease in Akt activation. A significant prevention of the Abeta25-35-induced cell loss in CA1 was also observed. EPO is neuroprotective in the Abeta25-35 AD model, confirming its potential as an endogenous neuroprotection system that could be boosted for therapeutic efficacy. We here identified a new IN formulation of EPO showing high neuroprotective activity. Considering its efficacy, ease and safety, IN Neuro-EPO is a new promising therapeutic agent in AD.",

    "abstract": "Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is involved in the multiple signaling processes of a cell. Increasing evidence suggests that GSK3beta plays a key role in multiple cellular processes in the progression of diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), inflammatory diseases, schizophrenia, bipolar and several mood disorders, and mitochondrial diseases. Recent research has found that increased GSK3beta activity is linked to the pathogenesis of AD through amyloid beta (Abeta), phosphorylated tau and mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent research has also revealed that GSK3beta is elevated in AD-affected tissues and is critically involved in dissociating the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) protein from hexokinases, and causing disrupted glucose metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction and activating apoptotic cell death. The purpose of this article is to review recent research that is elucidating the role of GSK3beta in AD pathogenesis. We discuss the involvement of GSK3beta in the phosphorylation of VDAC1 and dissociation of VADC1 with hexokinases in AD neurons.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease are neurodegenerative disorders characterised by the misfolding of proteins into soluble prefibrillar aggregates. These aggregate complexes disrupt mitochondrial function, initiating a pathophysiological cascade leading to synaptic and neuronal degeneration. In order to explore the interaction of amyloid aggregates with mitochondrial membranes, we made use of two in vitro model systems, namely: (i) lipid vesicles with defined membrane compositions that mimic those of mitochondrial membranes, and (ii) respiring mitochondria isolated from neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. External application of soluble prefibrillar forms, but not monomers, of amyloid-beta (Abeta42 peptide), wild-type alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), mutant alpha-syn (A30P and A53T) and tau-441 proteins induced a robust permeabilisation of mitochondrial-like vesicles, and triggered cytochrome c release (CCR) from isolated mitochondrial organelles. Importantly, the effect on mitochondria was shown to be dependent upon cardiolipin, an anionic phospholipid unique to mitochondria and a well-known key player in mitochondrial apoptosis. Pharmacological modulators of mitochondrial ion channels failed to inhibit CCR. Thus, we propose a generic mechanism of thrilling mitochondria in which soluble amyloid aggregates have the intrinsic capacity to permeabilise mitochondrial membranes, without the need of any other protein. Finally, six small-molecule compounds and black tea extract were tested for their ability to inhibit permeation of mitochondrial membranes by Abeta42, alpha-syn and tau aggregate complexes. We found that black tea extract and rosmarinic acid were the most potent mito-protectants, and may thus represent important drug leads to alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.",

The toxic misfolding and self-assembling of amyloidogenic proteins are believed to underlie protein misfolding diseases. Novel drug candidates targeting self-assembled amyloidogenic proteins represent a potential therapeutic approach for protein misfolding diseases. SCOPE OF REVIEW: In this perspective review, we provide an overview of the recent progress in identifying inhibitors that block the aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins and the clinical applications thereof. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Compounds such as polyphenols, certain short peptides, and monomer- or oligomer-specific antibodies, can interfere with the self-assembly of amyloidogenic proteins, prevent the formation of oligomers, amyloid fibrils and the consequent cytotoxicity. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Some inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials for treating protein misfolding diseases. Inhibitors that target the aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins bring new hope to therapy for protein misfolding diseases.",

Present knowledge considers any peptide/protein able to undergo misfolding and aggregation generating intrinsically cytotoxic amyloids. It also describes growth and structure of amyloid fibrils and their possible disassembly, whereas reduced information is available on oligomer structure. Recent research has highlighted the importance of the environmental conditions as determinants of the amyloid polymorphisms and cytotoxicity. Another body of evidence describes chemical or biological surfaces as key sites of protein misfolding and aggregation or of interaction with amyloids and the resulting biochemical modifications inducing cell functional/viability impairment. In particular, the membrane lipid composition appears to modulate cell response to toxic amyloids, thus contributing to explain the variable vulnerability to the same amyloids of different cell types. Finally, a recent view describes amyloid toxicity as an emerging property dependent on a complex interplay between the biophysical features of early aggregates and the interacting cell membranes taken as a whole system.",

    "abstract": "Functional and ultrastructural investigations support the concept that altered brain connectivity, exhausted neural plasticity, and synaptic loss are the strongest correlates of cognitive decline in age-related neurodegenerative dementia of Alzheimer's type. We have previously demonstrated that in transgenic mice, expressing amyloid-beta precursor protein-Swedish mutation active caspase-3 accumulates in hippocampal postsynaptic compartments leading to altered postsynaptic density (PSD) composition, increased long-term depression (LTD), and dendritic spine loss. Furthermore, we found strong evidence that dendritic spine alteration is mediated by calcineurin activation, a calcium-dependent phosphatase involved in synapse signaling. In the present work, we analyzed the molecular mechanism linking alteration of synaptic plasticity to the increase of calcineurin activity. We found that acute treatment of young and plaque-free transgenic mice with the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 leads to a complete rescue of LTD and PSD composition. Our findings are in agreement with other results reporting that calcineurin inhibition improves memory function and restores dendritic spine density, confirming that calcineurin inhibition may be explored as a neuroprotective treatment to stop or slowdown synaptic alterations in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: The present study evaluated the combined treatment effects of aerobic exercise and antioxidative stress on moderate-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Ten-month-old APP/PS1 mice were given antioxidative treatment with acetylcysteine, along with aerobic exercise for 6 weeks. Spatial learning and memory were tested using the Morris water maze, and beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque deposits in the forebrain were quantified by Thioflavin-S staining. Levels of soluble Abeta1-42, beta-secretase enzyme, y-secretase enzyme, oxidative and antioxidant stress markers nitrotyrosine and peroxiredoxin-1, glial markers glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1, and synaptic protein synaptophysin in the hippocampus were all measured by western blotting and/or immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: APP/PS1 mice showed severe declines in spatial learning and memory compared with their wild-type littermates, which were not attenuated by aerobic exercise combined with antioxidative treatment. The pathologic analysis revealed that Abeta deposition and production, oxidative stress, glial inflammation, and synaptic loss were not mitigated in the brain of exercised APP/PS1 mice, compared with the sedentary APP/PS1 animals. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that a combined treatment of aerobic exercise plus antioxidative stress does not counteract pathophysiology in the moderate- or mid-stages of AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease that is characterised by the presence of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and synaptic loss specifically in brain regions involved in learning and memory such as the neocortex and the hippocampus. Abeta depositions in the form of neuritic plaques trigger activation of microglia that is believed to be a common neuropathological feature of AD brains. As an integral part of the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus (DG) plays an important role in cognitive function. Although post-mortem studies suggest later involvement of the DG into the AD progression, changes in microglia have not been studied in this subfield of the hippocampus. In the present study the numerical density (Nv, #/mm(3)) of both resting (identified by tomato lectin staining) and activated (identified by Mac-1 immunoreactivity) microglia was analysed in the molecular layer (ML) of the DG in the triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mouse model of AD at different ages (9, 12 and 18 months). The 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD showed a significant increase in the Nv of resting (by 75%) and activated (by 67%) at 18 months of age compared to non-Tg controls. These results indicate a complex microglial remodelling during AD progression.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of copper homeostasis has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) during the last 2 decades; however, whether copper is a friend or a foe is controversial. Within a genetically tractable Drosophila AD model, we manipulated the expression of human high-affinity copper importer orthologous in Drosophila to explore the in vivo roles of copper ions in the development of AD. We found that inhibition of Ctr1C expression by RNAi in Abeta-expressing flies significantly reduced copper accumulation in the brains of the flies as well as ameliorating neurodegeneration, enhancing climbing ability, and prolonging lifespan. Interestingly, Ctr1C inhibition led to a significant increase in higher-molecular-weight Abeta42 forms in brain lysates, whereas it was accompanied by a trend of decreased expression of amyloid-beta degradation proteases (including NEP1-3 and IDE) with age and reduced Cu-Abeta interaction-induced oxidative stress in Ctr1C RNAi flies. Similar results were obtained from inhibiting another copper importer Ctr1B and overexpressing a copper exporter DmATP7 in the nervous system of AD flies. These results imply that copper may play a causative role in developing AD, as either Abeta oligomers or aggregates were less toxic in a reduced copper environment or one with less copper binding. Early manipulation of brain copper uptake can have a great effect on Abeta pathology.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of amyloid-beta-containing neuritic plaques and intracellular tau protein tangles are key histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This type of pathology clearly indicates that the mechanisms of neuronal housekeeping and protein quality control are compromised in AD. There is mounting evidence that the autophagosome-lysosomal degradation is impaired, which could disturb the processing of APP and provoke AD pathology. Beclin 1 is a molecular platform assembling an interactome with stimulating and suppressive components which regulate the initiation of the autophagosome formation. Recent studies have indicated that the expression Beclin 1 is reduced in AD brain. Moreover, the deficiency of Beclin 1 in cultured neurons and transgenic mice provokes the deposition of amyloid-beta peptides whereas its overexpression reduces the accumulation of amyloid-beta. There are several potential mechanisms, which could inhibit the function of Beclin 1 interactome and thus impair autophagy and promote AD pathology. The mechanisms include (i) reduction of Beclin 1 expression or its increased proteolytic cleavage by caspases, (ii) sequestration of Beclin 1 to non-functional locations, such as tau tangles, (iii) formation of inhibitory complexes between Beclin 1 and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins or inflammasomes, (iv) interaction of Beclin 1 with inhibitory neurovirulent proteins, e.g. herpex simplex ICP34.5, or (v) inhibition of the Beclin 1/Vps34 complex through the activation of CDK1 and CDK5. We will shortly introduce the function of Beclin 1 interactome in autophagy and phagocytosis, review the recent evidence indicating that Beclin 1 regulates autophagy and APP processing in AD, and finally examine the potential mechanisms through which Beclin 1 dysfunction could be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) is a key molecule in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reliable immunohistochemical (IHC) methods to detect Abeta and Abeta-associated factors (AAF) in brain specimens are needed to determine their role in AD pathophysiology. Formic acid (FA) pre-treatment, which is generally used to enable efficient detection of Abeta with IHC, induces structural modifications within the Abeta, as well as in AAF. Consequently, interpretation of double IHC stainings becomes difficult. Therefore, serial stainings of two newly produced monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) VU-17 and IC16 and two other mAbs (6E10 and 3D6) were performed with four different pre-treatments (no pre-treatment, Tris/EDTA, citrate and FA) and additionally six IHC characteristics were scored: diffuse/compact/classic plaques, arteries with cerebral Abeta angiopathy, dyshoric angiopathy, capillaries with dyshoric angiopathy. Subsequently, these stainings were compared with IHC procedures, which are frequently used in a diagnostic setting, employing mAbs 4G8 and 6F/3D with FA pre-treatment. IHC Abeta patterns obtained with VU-17 and, IC16 and 3D6 without the use of FA pre-treatment were comparable to those obtained with 4G8 and 6F/3D upon FA pre-treatment. Omission of FA pre-treatment gives the advantage to allow double IHC stainings, detecting both Abeta and AAF that otherwise would have been structural modificated upon FA pre-treatment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. There is a consensus that Abeta is a pathologic agent and that its toxic effects, which are at present incompletely understood, may occur through several potential mechanisms. Polyphenols are known to have wide-ranging properties with regard to health and for helping to prevent various diseases like neurodegenerative disorders. Thus inhibiting the formation of toxic Abeta assemblies is a reasonable hypothesis to prevent and perhaps treat AD METHODS: Solution NMR and molecular modeling were used to obtain more information about the interaction between the Abeta1-40 and the polyphenol epsilon-viniferin glucoside (EVG) and particularly the Abeta residues involved in the complex. RESULTS: The study demonstrates the formation of a complex between two EVG molecules and Abeta1-40 in peptide characteristic regions that could be in agreement with the inhibition of aggregation. Indeed, in previous studies, we reported that EVG strongly inhibited in vitro the fibril formation of the full length peptides Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42, and had a strong protective effect against PC12 cell death induced by these peptides. CONCLUSION: For the full length peptide Abeta1-40, the binding sites observed could explain the EVG inhibitory effect on fibrillization and thus prevent amyloidogenic neurotoxicity. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Even though this interaction might be important at the biological level to explain the protective effect of polyphenols in neurodegenerative diseases, caution is required when extrapolating this in vitro model to human physiology.",

    "title": "Protective effects of EphB2 on Abeta1-42 oligomer-induced neurotoxicity and synaptic NMDA receptor signaling in hippocampal neurons.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized pathologically by the abnormal deposition of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers. However, the nature and precise mechanism of the toxicity of Abeta oligomers are not clearly understood. Abeta oligomers have been previously shown to cause a major loss of EphB2, a member of the EphB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. To determine the effect of EphB2 on Abeta oligomer-induced neurotoxicity and the underlying molecular mechanisms, we examined the EphB2 gene in cultured hippocampal neurons. Using a cellular model of AD, Abeta1-42 oligomers were confirmed to induce neurotoxicity in a time-dependent manner and result in a major decrease of EphB2. EphB2 overexpression could prevent the neurotoxicity of hippocampal neurons from exposure to Abeta1-42 oligomers for 1h. Further analysis revealed that EphB2 overexpression increased synaptic NR1 and NR2B expression in Abeta1-42 oligomer-treated neurons. Moreover, EphB2 overexpression prevented Abeta1-42 oligomer-induced downregulation of dephosphorylated p38 MAPK and phosphorylated CREB. Together, these results suggest that EphB2 is a factor which protects hippocampal neurons against the toxicity of Abeta1-42 oligomers, and we infer that the protection of EphB2 is achieved by increasing the synaptic NMDA receptor level and downstream p38 MAPK and CREB signaling in hippocampal neurons. This study provides new molecular insights into the neuroprotective effect of EphB2 and highlights its potential therapeutic role in the management of AD.",

    "abstract": "Although chromogranin A (CGA) is frequently present in Alzheimer's disease (AD), senile plaques associated with microglial activation, little is known about basic difference between CGA and fibrillar amyloid-beta (fAbeta) as neuroinflammatory factors. Here we have compared the interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) production pathways by CGA and fAbeta in microglia. In cultured microglia, production of IL-1beta was induced by CGA, but not by fAbeta. CGA activated both nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and pro-caspase-1, whereas fAbeta activated pro-caspase-1 only. For the activation of pro-caspase-1, both CGA and fAbeta needed the enzymatic activity of cathepsin B (CatB), but only fAbeta required cytosolic leakage of CatB and the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In contrast, fAbeta induced the IL-1beta secretion from microglia isolated from the aged mouse brain. In AD brain, highly activated microglia, which showed intense immunoreactivity for CatB and IL-1beta, surrounded CGA-positive plaques more frequently than Abeta-positive plaques. These observations indicate differential pathways for the microglial IL-1beta production by CGA and fAbeta, which may aid in better understanding of the pathological significance of neuroinflammation in AD.",

Interactions between amyloid precursor protein (APP) and PrP(c) proteins have been described at the neuron level. Accordingly to this putative interaction, we investigated whether beta-amyloid accumulation may affect prion infectivity and, conversely, whether different amounts of PrP may affect beta-amyloid accumulation. For this purpose, we used the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse line, a common model of Alzheimer's disease, crossed with mice that either overexpress (Tga20) or that lack prion protein (knock-out) to generate mice that express varying amounts of prion protein and deposit beta-amyloid. On these mouse lines, we investigated the influence of each protein on the evolution of both diseases. Our results indicated that although the presence of APP/PS1 and beta-amyloid accumulation had no effect on prion infectivity, the accumulation of beta-amyloid deposits was dependent on PrP(c), whereby increasing levels of prion protein were accompanied by a significant increase in beta-amyloid aggregation associated with aging.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain is the result of impaired clearance, due in part to diminished Abeta transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Recently, modulation of the cannabinoid system was shown to reduce Abeta brain levels and improve cognitive behavior in AD animal models. The purpose of the current studies was to investigate the role of the cannabinoid system in the clearance of Abeta across the BBB. Using in vitro and in vivo models of BBB clearance, Abeta transit across the BBB was examined in the presence of cannabinoid receptor agonists and inhibitors. In addition, expression levels of the Abeta transport protein, lipoprotein receptor-related protein1 (LRP1), were determined in the brain and plasma of mice following cannabinoid treatment. Cannabinoid receptor agonism or inhibition of endocannabinoid-degrading enzymes significantly enhanced Abeta clearance across the BBB (2-fold). Moreover, cannabinoid receptor inhibition negated the stimulatory influence of cannabinoid treatment on Abeta BBB clearance. Additionally, LRP1 levels in the brain and plasma were elevated following cannabinoid treatment (1.5-fold), providing rationale for the observed increase in Abeta transit from the brain to the periphery. The current studies demonstrate, for the first time, a role for the cannabinoid system in the transit of Abeta across the BBB. These findings provide insight into the mechanism by which cannabinoid treatment reduces Abeta burden in the AD brain and offer additional evidence on the utility of this pathway as a treatment for AD.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is thought to be a central pathology in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neprilysin (NEP), a plasma membrane glycoprotein of the neutral zinc metalloendopeptidase family, is known as a major Abeta-degrading enzyme in the brain. The level of NEP is reduced in the brains of patients with AD; therefore, NEP is under intense investigation as a potential therapeutic source for degradation of deposited Abeta in AD. Previous studies have utilized viral vectors expressing NEP for reduction of Abeta deposition in the brain. However, viral vectors have disadvantages regarding difficulty in control of insert size, expression desired (short- or long-term), and target cell type. Here, in order to overcome these disadvantages, we produced recombinant soluble NEP from insect cells using an NEP expression vector, which was administered by intracerebral injection into AD mice, resulting in significantly reduced accumulation of Abeta. In addition, AD mice treated with NEP showed improved behavioral performance on the water maze test. These data support a role of recombinant soluble NEP in improving memory impairment by regulation of Abeta deposition and suggest the possibility that approaches using protein therapy might have potential for development of alternative therapies for treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Follow-up of beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer disease (AD) would be a valuable translational tool in the preclinical evaluation of potential antiamyloid therapies. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of the clinically used PET tracer (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PIB) to detect changes over time in Abeta deposition in the brains of living mice representing the APP23, Tg2576, and APP(swe)-PS1(dE9) transgenic mouse models of AD. METHODS: Mice from each transgenic strain were imaged with 60-min dynamic PET scans at 7-9, 12, 15, and 18-22 mo of age. Regional (11)C-PIB retention was quantitated as distribution volume ratios using Logan graphical analysis with cerebellar reference input, as radioactivity uptake ratios between the frontal cortex (FC) and the cerebellum (CB) during the 60-min scan, and as bound-to-free ratios in the late washout phase (40-60 min). Ex vivo autoradiography experiments were performed after the final imaging session to validate (11)C-PIB binding to Abeta deposits. Additionally, the presence of Abeta deposits was evaluated in vitro using staining with thioflavin-S and Abeta1-40, Abeta1-16, and AbetaN3(pE) immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Neocortical (11)C-PIB retention was markedly increased in old APP23 mice with large thioflavin-S-positive Abeta deposits. At 12 mo, the Logan distribution volume ratio for the FC was 1.03 and 0.93 (n = 2), increasing to 1.38 +- 0.03 (n = 3) and 1.34 (n = 1) at 18 and 21 mo of age, respectively. An increase was also observed in bound-to-free ratios for the FC between young (7- to 12-mo-old) and old (15- to 22-mo-old) APP23 mice. Binding of (11)C-PIB to Abeta-rich cortical regions was also evident in ex vivo autoradiograms of APP23 brain sections. In contrast, no increases in (11)C-PIB retention were observed in aging Tg2576 or APP(swe)-PS1(dE9) mice in vivo, although in the latter, extensive Abeta deposition was already observed at 9 mo of age with immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that (11)C-PIB binding to Abeta deposits in transgenic mouse brain is highly dependent on the AD model and the structure of its Abeta plaques. Longitudinal in vivo (11)C-PIB uptake studies are possible in APP23 mice.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Discuss etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and offer a paradigm shift-a change in basic assumptions-from present standards in clinical trials. DATA SOURCE: PubMed search for studies into AD pathophysiology and assessment of disease progression. Searched terms: amyloid precursor protein/amyloid beta pathology, senile plaques, mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species , advanced glycation end products, neuro-inflammation, dysfunctional microglia/astrocytes, proinflammatory cytokines, ApoE4 allele, Tau phosphorylation, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Dementia Severity Rating Scale, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, Relative's Assessment of Global Symptomatology-Elderly, and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive. STUDY SELECTION: All prospective, randomized, placebo- or cohort-controlled, peer-reviewed English language publications from 1980 to 2012. Studies in animals, AD patients, and AD brain specimens. DATA EXTRACTION: Objectives, methods, statistical design, and results reviewed to assess soundness of trials and validity of results. Trials with flawed methods or uninterpretable results excluded. DATA SYNTHESIS: Primary pathophysiology comprises: amyloid precursor protein/amyloid beta pathology with deposition of senile plaques; mitochondrial dysfunction with insufficient ATP synthesis and release of reactive oxygen species; oxidative stress; and neuro-inflammation from dysfunction of microglia and astrocytes. Other factors include abnormal ApoE4 allele protein and aberrant Tau phosphorylation. Role of Chlamydia pneumoniae is unproven. Dementia Severity Rating Scale (DSRS) is optimal assessment tool for assessing AD progression. CONCLUSION: AD's complex pathophysiology may require polypharmacy to mitigate symptoms and progression. DSRS-driven, 10-patient pilot studies offer practical, valid, and reliable screening for potentially effective pharmacotherapy in AD. The simplicity of this paradigm shift should expedite research and may promote earlier discovery of effective pharmacotherapy for AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta deposition in amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, inflammation, neuronal loss, and cognitive deficits. Cannabinoids display neuromodulatory and neuroprotective effects and affect memory acquisition. Here, we studied the impact of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) deficiency on the development of AD pathology by breeding amyloid precursor protein (APP) Swedish mutant mice (APP23), an AD animal model, with CB1-deficient mice. In addition to the lower body weight of APP23/CB1(-/-) mice, most of these mice died at an age before typical AD-associated changes become apparent. The surviving mice showed a reduced amount of APP and its fragments suggesting a regulatory influence of CB1 on APP processing, which was confirmed by modulating CB1 expression in vitro. Reduced APP levels were accompanied by a reduced plaque load and less inflammation in APP23/CB1(-/-) mice. Nevertheless, compared to APP23 mice with an intact CB1, APP23/CB1(-/-) mice showed impaired learning and memory deficits. These data argue against a direct correlation of amyloid plaque load with cognitive abilities in this AD mouse model lacking CB1. Furthermore, the findings indicate that CB1 deficiency can worsen AD-related cognitive deficits and support a potential role of CB1 as a pharmacologic target.",

    "title": "Glycyrrhiza and Uncaria Hook contribute to protective effect of traditional Japanese medicine yokukansan against amyloid beta oligomer-induced neuronal death.",
    "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Yokukansan, a traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicine, composed of seven medicinal herbs has been traditionally used to treat neurosis, insomnia, and night crying and irritability in children. Recently, this medicine has been reported to improve the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) that often become problematic in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). AIM OF THE STUDY: Amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers, which are extremely toxic to neurons, are involved in neurodegeneration in AD. In animals, yokukansan has been proven to improve memory impairments and BPSD-like behavior in transgenic mice overexpressing amyloid precursor protein and mice intracerebroventricularly injected with Abeta oligomers. These results suggest that yokukansan is potentially able to reduce the neurotoxicity of Abeta oligomers. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the improving effects brought by yokukansan that consists of seven herbs for Abeta oligomer-induced neurotoxicity in vitro and to identify the candidate herbs in yokukansan's action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary cultured rat cortical neurons were used. Neurotoxicity induced by Abeta oligomers (3microM) and improving effects of yokukansan (300-1000 microg/mL) and its constituent herbs were evaluated in MTT assay, DNA fragmentation analysis, and electron microscopic analysis at 48h after treatment with Abeta oligomers and drugs. Moreover, changes in expression of genes related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and in caspase-3 activity that is the enzyme closely related to apoptosis were analyzed to investigate the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: Yokukansan ameliorated Abeta oligomer-induced neuronal damage in a dose-dependent manner in the MTT assay. This drug also suppressed DNA fragmentation caused by Abeta oligomers. Electron microscopic analysis suggested that yokukansan reduced karyopyknosis and the expansion of rough ER caused by Abeta oligomers. However, neither Abeta oligomers nor yokukansan affected the mRNA expression of any ER stress-related genes, including CHOP and GRP78. On the other hand, yokukansan dose-dependently suppressed Abeta oligomer-induced activation of caspase-3. Among the seven constituents of yokukansan, Glycyrrhiza and Uncaria Hook (60-200 microg/mL) suppressed Abeta oligomer-induced neuronal damage, DNA fragmentation, karyopyknosis, and caspase-3 activation to almost the same extent as yokukansan. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that yokukansan possesses an ameliorative effect against Abeta oligomer-induced neuronal apoptosis through the suppression of caspase-3 activation. Glycyrrhiza and Uncaria Hook may, at least in part, contribute to the neuroprotective effect of yokukansan. These mechanisms may underlie the improving effects of yokukansan on memory impairment and BPSD-like behaviors induced by Abeta oligomers.",

    "abstract": "Early observations of the patterns of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease suggested a hierarchical vulnerability of neurons for tangles, and a widespread nonspecific pattern of plaques that nonetheless seemed to correlate with the terminal zone of tangle-bearing neurons in some instances. The first neurofibrillary cortical lesions in Alzheimer's disease occur in the entorhinal cortex, thereby disrupting the origin of the perforant pathway projection to the hippocampus, and amyloid deposits are often found in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, which is the terminal zone of the entorhinal cortex. We modeled these anatomical changes in a transgenic mouse model that overexpresses both P301L tau (uniquely in the medial entorhinal cortex) and mutant APP/PS1 (in a widespread distribution) to examine the anatomical consequences of early tangles, plaques, or the combination. We find that tau uniformly occupies the terminal zone of the perforant pathway in tau-expressing mice. By contrast, the addition of amyloid deposits in this area leads to disruption of the perforant pathway terminal zone and apparent aberrant distribution of tau-containing axons. Moreover, human P301L tau-containing axons appear to increase the extent of dystrophic axons around plaques. Thus, the presence of amyloid deposits in the axonal terminal zone of pathological tau-containing neurons profoundly impacts their normal connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Cholesterol can be converted to 24S-hydroxycholesterol (24SOHC) by neuronal cholesterol 24-hydroxylase. In mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), increasing 24SOHC levels reduced AD pathology. However, mechanisms underlying the effects of 24SOHC on amyloid-beta (Abeta) production have remained unclear. Here we report that 24SOHC treatment reduces Abeta production and increases endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident immature amyloid precursor protein (APP) levels in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and CHO cells stably expressing human APP. Treatment with 1-10 muM 24SOHC (equivalent to the concentrations detected in human brain homogenates) diminished Abeta production (IC50=4.6 muM for Abeta40) without affecting secretase activities. To evaluate the intracellular APP transport, we established an in vitro vesicle formation assay. We found that APP budding via COPII vesicles was diminished by 70% in 24SOHC-treated cells. The proteomics and immunoblotting analysis revealed that 24SOHC induced the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), an ER chaperone, through unfolded protein response pathways, and enhanced the formation of the APP/GRP78 complex. Knockdown of GRP78 diminished the inhibitory effects of 24SOHC on Abeta production. These results suggest that 24SOHC down-regulates APP trafficking via enhancement of the complex formation of APP with up-regulated GRP78 in the ER, resulting in suppression of Abeta production.",

    "abstract": "The interaction of Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions with amyloid-beta (Abeta) plays an important role in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. We describe the use of electron spin resonance (ESR) to measure metal-binding competition between Cu(II) and Zn(II) in amyloid-beta at physiological pH. Continuous wave ESR measurements show that the affinity of Cu(II) toward Abeta(1-16) is significantly higher than that of Zn(II) at physiological pH. Importantly, of the two known Cu(II) coordination modes in Abeta, component I and component II, Zn(II) displaces Cu(II) only from component I. Our results indicate that at excess amounts of Zn(II) component II becomes the most dominant coordination mode. This observation is important as Abeta aggregates in the brain contain a high Zn(II) ion concentration. In order to determine details of the metal ion competition, electron spin echo envelope modulation experiments were carried out on Abeta variants that were systematically (15)N labeled. In the presence of Zn(II), most peptides use His 14 as an equatorial ligand to bind Cu(II) ions. Interestingly, Zn(II) ions completely substitute Cu(II) ions that are simultaneously coordinated to His 6 and His 13. Furthermore, in the presence of Zn(II), the proportion of Cu(II) ions that are simultaneously coordinated to His 13 and His 14 is increased. On the basis of our results we suggest that His 13 plays a critical role in modulating the morphology of Abeta aggregates.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrovascular disease and vascular risk factors are associated with Alzheimer's disease, but the evidence for their association with other neurodegenerative disorders is limited. Therefore, we compared the prevalence of cerebrovascular disease, vascular pathology and vascular risk factors in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases and correlate them with dementia severity. Presence of cerebrovascular disease, vascular pathology and vascular risk factors was studied in 5715 cases of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centre database with a single neurodegenerative disease diagnosis (Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration due to tau, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 immunoreactive deposits, alpha-synucleinopathies, hippocampal sclerosis and prion disease) based on a neuropathological examination with or without cerebrovascular disease, defined neuropathologically. In addition, 210 'unremarkable brain' cases without cognitive impairment, and 280 cases with pure cerebrovascular disease were included for comparison. Cases with cerebrovascular disease were older than those without cerebrovascular disease in all the groups except for those with hippocampal sclerosis. After controlling for age and gender as fixed effects and centre as a random effect, we observed that alpha-synucleinopathies, frontotemporal lobar degeneration due to tau and TAR DNA-binding protein 43, and prion disease showed a lower prevalence of coincident cerebrovascular disease than patients with Alzheimer's disease, and this was more significant in younger subjects. When cerebrovascular disease was also present, patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with alpha-synucleinopathy showed relatively lower burdens of their respective lesions than those without cerebrovascular disease in the context of comparable severity of dementia at time of death. Concurrent cerebrovascular disease is a common neuropathological finding in aged subjects with dementia, is more common in Alzheimer's disease than in other neurodegenerative disorders, especially in younger subjects, and lowers the threshold for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and alpha-synucleinopathies, which suggests that these disorders should be targeted by treatments for cerebrovascular disease.",

To reconcile the dominant action of pathogenic PSEN1 mutations with evidence that they confer a loss of mutant protein function, we tested the hypothesis that PSEN1 mutations interfere with gamma-secretase activity in a dominant-negative manner. Here, we show that pathogenic PSEN1 mutations act in cis to impair mutant PS1 function and act in trans to inhibit wild-type PS1 function. Coexpression of mutant and wild-type PS1 at equal gene dosage in presenilin-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts resulted in trans-dominant-negative inhibition of wild-type PS1 activity, suppressing gamma-secretase-dependent cleavage of APP and Notch. Surprisingly, mutant PS1 could stimulate production of Abeta42 by wild-type PS1 while decreasing its production of Abeta40. Mutant and wild-type PS1 efficiently coimmunoprecipitated, suggesting that mutant PS1 interferes with wild-type PS1 activity via physical interaction. These results support the conclusion that mutant PS1 causes wild-type PS1 to adopt an altered conformation with impaired catalytic activity and substrate specificity. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of action for pathogenic PSEN1 mutations and suggest that dominant-negative inhibition of presenilin activity plays an important role in FAD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (abeta) protein assembles into larger protein aggregates during the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and there is increasing evidence that soluble abeta oligomers are a critical pathologic species. Diagnostic evaluations rely on the measurement of increased tau and decreased abeta42 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD patients and evidence for oligomeric abeta in patient CSF is conflicting. In this study, we have adapted a monoclonal single antibody sandwich ELISA assay to a Luminex platform and found that this assay can detect oligomerized abeta42 and sAPPalpha fragments. We evaluated oligomeric abeta reactivity in 20 patients with AD relative to 19 age matched controls and compared these values with a commercially available Alzbio3 kit that detects tau, phosphorylated tau and abeta42 on the same diagnostic platform. We found that CSF samples of patients with AD had elevated abeta oligomers compared to control subjects (p < 0.05) and the ratio of abeta oligomers to abeta42 was also significantly elevated (p < 0.0001). Further research to develop high sensitivity analytical platforms and rigorous methods of developing stable assay standards will be needed before the analysis of oligomeric abeta becomes a routine diagnostic assay for the evaluation of late onset AD patients.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression and is associated with synaptic damage and neuronal death. Epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that hypercholesterolemia and hyperhomocysteinemia increase susceptibility to AD; however, the exact impact and mechanisms involved are largely unknown. Few studies have addressed the combined effects of the above compounds, which are considered to be risk factors for developing AD, on Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. The aim of the present work was to analyze the relationships between homocysteine (Hcy) and cholesterol and their role in Abeta toxicity in human neuroblastoma cells, as well as the mechanisms associated with this neurotoxicity. In addition to finding that Hcy is involved in cholesterol homeostasis in neurons, we demonstrate that the combined effect of cholesterol and Hcy in the presence of copper significantly increases the levels of reactive oxygen species and may render neurons more vulnerable to Abeta.",

    "abstract": "Photoluminescent molecules are widely used for real-time monitoring of peptide aggregation. In this Article, we detail both experimental and computational modeling to elucidate the interaction between [Ru(bpy)2dppz](2+) and amyloid-beta (Abeta(1-40)) aggregates. The transition from monomeric to fibrillar Abeta is of interest in the study of Alzheimer's disease. Concentration-dependent experiments allowed the determination of a dissociation constant of 2.1 muM, while Job plots provided a binding stoichiometry of 2.6 Abeta monomers per [Ru(bpy)2dppz](2+). Our computational approach that combines molecular docking (both rigid and flexible) and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations predicts that the hydrophobic cleft between Val18 and Phe20 is a plausible binding site, which could also explain the increase in photoluminescence of [Ru(bpy)2dppz](2+) upon binding. This binding site is parallel to the fibril axis, in marked contrast to the binding site of these complexes in DNA (perpendicular to the DNA axis). Other binding sites may exist at the edges of the Abeta fibril, but they are actually of low abundance in an Abeta fibril several micrometers long. The assignment of the binding site was confirmed by binding studies in an Abeta fragment (Abeta(25-35)) that lacked the amino acids necessary to form the binding site. The agreement between the experimental and computational work is remarkable and provides a general model that can be used for studying the interaction of amyloid-binding molecules to Abeta.",

    "abstract": "Various structural models for amyloid beta fibrils have been derived from a variety of experimental techniques. However, these models cannot differentiate between the relative position of the two arms of the beta hairpin called the stagger. Amyloid fibrils of various hierarchical levels form left-handed helices composed of beta sheets. However it is unclear if positive, negative and zero staggers all form the macroscopic left-handed helices. To address this issue we have conducted extensive molecular dynamics simulations of amyloid beta sheets of various staggers and shown that only negative staggers lead to the experimentally observed left-handed helices while positive staggers generate the incorrect right-handed helices. This result suggests that the negative staggers are physiologically relevant structure of the amyloid beta fibrils.",

    "abstract": "Two hallmarks of Alzheimer diseases are the continuous inflammatory process, and the brain deposit of Amyloid b (Abeta), a cytotoxic protein. The intracellular accumulation of Abeta(25-35) fractions, in the absence of Heat Shock proteins (Hsps), could be responsible for its cytotoxic activity. As, pro-inflammatory mediators and nitric oxide control the expression of Hsps, our aim was to investigate the effect of Abeta(25-35) on the concentration of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and nitrite levels, and their relation to pHSF-1, Hsp-60, -70 and -90 expressions, in the rat C6 astrocyte cells. Interleukin-specific ELISA kits, immunohistochemistry with monoclonal anti-Hsp and anti pHSF-1 antibodies, and histochemistry techniques, were used. Our results showed that Abeta25-35 treatment of C6 cells increased, significantly and consistently the concentration of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and nitrite 3 days after initiating treatment. The immunoreactivity of C6 cells to Hsp-70 reached its peak after 3 days of treatment followed by an abrupt decrease, as opposed to Hsp-60 and -90 expressions that showed an initial and progressive increase after 3 days of Abeta(25-35) treatment. pHSF-1 was identified throughout the experimental period. Nevertheless, progressive and sustained cell death was observed during all the treatment times and it was not caspase-3 dependent. Our results suggest that Hsp-70 temporary expression serves as a trigger to inhibit casapase-3 pathway and allow the expression of Hsp-60 and -90 in C6 astrocytoma cells stimulated with Abeta(25-35).",

Here, we focus on the value of the 42-residue-long amyloid beta isoform (Abeta1-42) peptide in the cerebrospinal fluid as the core, feasible neurobiochemical marker for the amyloidogenic mechanisms in early-onset familial and late-onset sporadic AD. We discuss the role and use of Abeta1-42 in combination with evolving neuroimaging biomarkers in AD detection and diagnosis. Multimodal neuroimaging techniques, directly providing structural-functional-metabolic aspects of brain pathophysiology, are supportive to predict and monitor the progression of the disease. Advances in multimodal neuroimaging provide new insights into brain organization and enable the detection of specific proteins and/or protein aggregates associated with AD. The combination of biomarkers from different methodologies is believed to be of incrementally added risk-value to accurately identify asymptomatic and prodromal individuals who will likely progress to dementia and represent rational biomarker candidates for preventive and symptomatic pharmacological intervention trials.",

The physiological function of APP is still not completely understood much because of the redundancy between genes in the APP family. In this study we have used zebrafish to study the physiological function of the zebrafish APP homologue, appb, during development. We show that appb is expressed in post-mitotic neurons in the spinal cord. Knockdown of appb by 50-60% results in a behavioral phenotype with increased spontaneous coiling and prolonged touch-induced activity. The spinal cord motor neurons in these embryos show defective formation and axonal outgrowth patterning. Reduction in Appb also results in patterning defects and changed density of pre- and post-synapses in the neuromuscular junctions. Together, our data show that development of functional locomotion in zebrafish depends on a critical role of Appb in the patterning of motor neurons and neuromuscular junctions.",

We evaluated the effects of several putative bioactive Abetas and gangliosides on neural stem cells (NSCs) isolated from embryonic mouse brains or the subventricular zone of adult mouse brains. Incubation of the isolated NSCs with soluble Abeta1-40 alone did not cause any change in the number of NSCs, but soluble Abeta1-42 increased their number. Aggregated Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 increased the number of NSCs but soluble and aggregated Abeta25-35 decreased the number. Soluble Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 did not affect the number of apoptotic cells but aggregated Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 did. When NSCs were treated with a combination of GM1 or GD3 and soluble Abeta1-42, cell proliferation was enhanced, indicating that both GM1 and GD3 as well as Abetas are involved in promoting cell proliferation and survival of NSCs. These observations suggest the potential of beneficial effects of using gangliosides and Abetas for promoting NSC proliferation.",

In addition, recent spectroscopic studies show that the interaction between monosialoganglioside and amyloid beta (Abeta protein promotes the transition of Abeta from the native structure to the cross-beta fold in amyloid aggregates. However, there is few evidence on the dynamics of \"lipid rafts\" membranes. As the neutron spin-echo (NSE) technique is well known to detect directly slow dynamics of membrane systems in situ, by the combination of NSE and small-angle X-ray scattering we have studied the effect of the interaction between raft-model membrane and amyloid Abeta proteins on the structure and dynamics of a large uni-lamellar vesicle (LUV) consisting of monosialoganglioside-cholesterol-phospholipid ternary mixtures as a model of lipid-raft membrane. We have found that the interaction between the Abeta proteins and the model membrane at the liquid crystal phase significantly suppresses a bending-diffusion motion with a minor effect on the LUV structure. The present results would suggest a possibility of non-receptor-mediated disorder in signaling through a modulation of a membrane dynamics induced by the association of amyloidogenic peptides on a plasma membrane.",

    "abstract": "Addition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide Abeta40 to Abeta42 can delay Abeta42 aggregation, but consequent cytotoxicity has been reported to be enhanced or diminished. In the present study, we found that cytotoxicity was enhanced when human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were incubated in a mixture of wt Abeta42 and Abeta40wt at a ratio of 1 : 10-20 (0.1 : 1-2 muM) for 24-36 h, whereas the enhancement was detected in cells incubated for longer times (48-60 h) with the less amyloidogenic Flemish Abeta40 variant or in cells incubated for as short as 12 h with the more amyloidogenic Dutch variant. Reductions in cytotoxicity by Abeta40 were most prominently observed in the Flemish and wt Abeta40/Abeta42 mixture at ratio 1 : 20 incubated for a short time (~12 h). The most cytotoxic Abeta40/Abeta42 mixtures were enriched in Abeta protofibril-like structures, implying a strong correlation between cytotoxicity and this structure, the formation of which was dependent on amyloidogenic properties and incubation time. The consequences of the interactions were probably because of the different amyloidogenic properties of the Abeta40 variants, rather than to those of Abeta42, because aggregation rates of Abeta40 variants were highly dependent on sequence, whereas those of Abeta42 variants were not. These studies highlight a potential role for Abeta40 in cytotoxicity and provide novel mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of each familial Alzheimer's disease-associated Abeta40 variant.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have concluded that the interaction of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) and cellular membranes contributes to the toxicity and cell death observed in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Aggregated Abeta species disrupt membranes, leading to physical instability and ion leakage. Further, the presence of Abeta on the membrane surface increases the aggregation rate of the peptide, as diffusion occurs in two dimensions, increasing the probability of interpeptide interactions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to investigate Abeta in a number of environments, including aqueous solution and membranes. We previously showed that monomeric Abeta40 remains embedded in membranes composed of the most common lipids found in the cell membrane, but that the presence of ganglioside GM1 promotes release of the peptide into the extracellular medium. Here, we explore the interactions of two Abeta40 peptides in model membranes to understand whether aggregation can occur prior to the release of the peptide into the aqueous environment. We found that aggregation occurred, to different extents, in each of the model membranes and that the aggregates, once formed, did not exit the membrane environment. This information may have important implications for understanding the affinity of Abeta for membranes and the mechanism of Abeta toxicity in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "A major characteristic of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers and aggregates in the brain. Abeta oligomers interact with the neuronal membrane inducing perforations, causing an influx of calcium ions and increasing the release of synaptic vesicles that leads to a delayed synaptic failure by vesicle depletion. Here, we identified a neuroprotective pentapeptide anti-Abeta compound having the sequence of the glycine zipper region of the C-terminal of Abeta (G33LMVG37). Docking and Forster resonance energy transfer experiments showed that G33LMVG37 interacts with Abeta at the C-terminal region, which is important for Abeta association and insertion into the lipid membrane. Furthermore, this pentapeptide interfered with Abeta aggregation, association, and perforation of the plasma membrane. The synaptotoxicity induced by Abeta after acute and chronic applications were abolished by G33LMVG37. These results provide a novel rationale for drug development against Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Age-associated dysregulation of sleep can be worsened by Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD and sleep restriction both impair cognition, yet it is unknown if mild chronic sleep restriction modifies the proteopathic processes involved in AD. The goal of this work was to test the hypothesis that sleep restriction worsens memory impairments, and amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) and pTau accumulations in the brain in a mouse model of AD, with a focus on a role for circulating glucocorticoids (GC). Male 3xTgAD mice were subjected to sleep restriction (SR) for 6h/day for 6 weeks using the modified multiple platform technique, and behavioral (Morris water maze, fear conditioning, open field) and biochemical (immunoblot) outcomes were compared to mice undergoing daily cage transfers (large cage control; LCC) as well as control mice that remained in their home cage (control; CTL). At one week, both LCC and SR mice displayed significant elevations in plasma corticosterone compared to CTL (p<0.002). By four weeks, SR mice displayed a two-fold increase in circulating corticosterone levels compared to CTL. Behavioral data indicated deficits in contextual and cued memory in SR mice that were not present for LCC or CTL (p<0.04). Both Abeta and pTau levels increased in the cortex of SR mice compared to CTL and LCC; however these changes were not noted in the hippocampus. Significant positive correlations between cortical Abeta and pTau levels and circulating corticosterone indicate a potential role for GCs in mediating behavioral and biochemical changes observed after sleep restriction in a mouse model of AD.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease (AD) brains are composed of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Noninvasive monitoring of tau protein aggregates in the living brain will provide useful information regarding tau pathophysiology in AD. However, no PET probes are currently available for selective detection of tau pathology in AD. We have previously reported (18)F-labeled THK-523 ((18)F-6-(2-fluoroethoxy)-2-(4-aminophenyl)quinoline) as a tau imaging radiotracer candidate for PET. After compound optimization, we developed novel (18)F-labeled arylquinoline derivatives, (18)F-THK-5105 and (18)F-THK-5117, for use as tau imaging PET tracers. METHODS: (18)F-labeled compounds were prepared from the corresponding tosylated precursors. The binding affinity of compounds to synthetic tau aggregates and tau-rich AD brain homogenates was determined by saturation and competition binding assays. The binding selectivity of compounds to tau pathology was evaluated by autoradiography of AD brain sections. The pharmacokinetics of compounds were assessed in biodistribution studies in normal mice. A 14-d toxicity study with intravenous administration of compounds was performed using rats and mice. RESULTS: In vitro binding assays demonstrated higher binding affinity of THK-5105 and THK-5117 than THK-523 to tau protein aggregates and tau-rich AD brain homogenates. Autoradiographic analyses of AD brain sections showed that these radiotracers preferentially bound to neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, which colocalized with Gallyas-positive and immunoreactive tau protein deposits. The distribution of this radiotracer binding in AD brain sections was completely different from that of (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B, showing preferential binding to amyloid plaques. Furthermore, these derivatives demonstrated abundant initial brain uptake and faster clearance in normal mice than (18)F-THK-523 and other reported (18)F-labeled radiotracers. THK-5105 and THK-5117 showed no toxic effects related to the administration of these compounds in mice and rats and no significant binding for various neuroreceptors, ion channels, and transporters at 1-muM concentrations. CONCLUSION: (18)F-labeled THK-5105 and THK-5117 are promising candidates as PET tau imaging radiotracers.",

    "abstract": "Most Alzheimer disease patients show deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide in blood vessels as well as the brain parenchyma. We previously found that vascular endothelial cells express amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) 770, a different APP isoform from neuronal APP695, and that they produce amyloid beta peptide. We analyzed the glycosylation of APP770 and found that O-glycosylated sAPP770 is preferentially processed by proteases for Abeta production. Because the soluble APP cleavage product sAPP is considered to be a possible marker for Alzheimer disease diagnosis, sAPP, consisting of a mixture of these variants, has been widely measured. We hypothesized that measurement of the endothelial APP770 cleavage product in patients separately from that of neuronal APP695 would enable us to discriminate between endothelial and neurological dysfunctions. Our recent findings, showing that the level of plasma sAPP770 is significantly higher in patients with acute coronary syndrome, raise the possibility that sAPP770 could be an indicator of endothelial dysfunction. In this review, we first describe the expression, glycosylation, and processing of APP770, and then discuss sAPP770 as a novel biomarker candidate of acute coronary syndrome.",

In this study, we examined the spatial patterns of amyloid deposition throughout the brain using Pittsburgh Compound Blue ((11)C-PiB) positron emission tomography data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. We used a new methodology that allowed us to approximate spatial patterns of the temporal progression of amyloid plaque deposition from cross-sectional data. Our results are consistent with patterns of progression known from autopsy studies, with frontal and precuneus regions affected early and occipital and sensorimotor cortices affected later in disease progression--here, disease progression means lower-to-higher total amyloid burden. Furthermore, we divided participants into subgroups based on longitudinal change in memory performance, and demonstrated significantly different spatial patterns of the estimated progression of amyloid deposition between these subgroups. Our results indicate that the spatial pattern of amyloid deposition is related to cognitive performance and may be more informative than a biomarker reflecting total amyloid burden, the use of which is the current practice. This finding has broad implications for our understanding of the relationship between cognitive decline/resilience and amyloid deposition, as well as for the use of amyloid imaging as a biomarker in research and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Among the consequences of Alzheimer disease are disturbances in synaptic integrity that ultimately lead to impaired cognitive functions. Thrombospondins are extracellular matrix proteins that, in the CNS, are predominantly produced by astrocytes and have been implicated in synaptogenesis. This study examined the effects of amyloid-beta (Abeta(1-42); Abeta) peptide on intracellular and extracellular levels of thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) in cultured astrocytes. Amyloid-beta caused a significant (1- to 3-fold) increase in astrocytic intracellular levels of TSP-1 (increased retention) that was associated with a reduction of its release from astrocytes. Because Abeta is known to induce oxidative stress in astrocytes, we examined the effects of the antioxidants tempol and apocynin on astrocytic TSP-1 levels and release. Treatment of Abeta-exposed astrocyte cultures with antioxidants significantly diminished its cellular retention and stimulated its release. Furthermore, the addition of conditioned media derived from Abeta-treated cultured astrocytes that contained a reduced TSP-1 content resulted in a significant loss of synaptophysin and PSD95 in cultured neurons. These findings suggest that Abeta-mediated reduction in astrocytic TSP-1 release, possibly related to oxidative stress, contributes to the loss of synaptophysin in neurons. Strategies aimed at enhancing the astrocytic release of TSP-1 may have a therapeutic benefit in Alzheimer disease.",

The results showed that Abeta25-35 could induce neurotoxicity as evidenced by the decreased cell viability and the increased apoptotic rate. In parallel, Abeta25-35 significantly increased the reactive oxygen species accumulation and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. However, pretreatment of the primary cortical neurons with MDHB could effectively suppress these cellular events caused by Abeta25-35 exposure. In addition, MDHB could increase the level of Bcl-2, decrease the level of Bax, and inhibit the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 in Abeta25-35 -treated primary cortical neurons. All these results were beneficial in their protective effect against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. Our results suggest that MDHB has a neuroprotective effect that provides a pharmacological basis for its clinical use in the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Altered concentrations of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and Tau protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are thought to be predictive markers for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Transgenic mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP) have been used to model Abeta pathology, but concomitant changes in Abeta and Tau in CSF have been less well studied. We measured Abeta and Tau in the brains and CSF of two well-characterized transgenic mouse models of AD: one expressing human APP carrying the Swedish mutation (APP23) and the other expressing mutant human APP and mutant human presenilin-1 (APPPS1). Both mouse models exhibit Abeta deposition in the brain, but with different onset and progression trajectories. We found an age-related 50 to 80% decrease in Abeta42 peptide in mouse CSF and a smaller decrease in Abeta40, both inversely correlated with the brain Abeta load. Surprisingly, the same mice showed a threefold increase in total endogenous murine Tau in CSF at the stages when Abeta pathology became prominent. The results mirror the temporal sequence and magnitude of Abeta and Tau changes in the CSF of patients with sporadic and dominantly inherited AD. This observation indicates that APP transgenic mice may be useful as a translational tool for predicting changes in Abeta and Tau markers in the CSF of AD patients. These findings also suggest that APP transgenic mouse models may be useful in the search for new disease markers for AD.",

In addition to the mental deficiencies and physical anomalies noted at birth, triplication of chromosome 21 gene products results in the neuropathological and cognitive changes of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mapping of the gene that encodes the precursor protein (APP) of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) present in the Abeta plaques in both AD and DS to chromosome 21 was strong evidence that this chromosome 21 gene product was a principal neuropathogenic culprit in AD as well as DS. The discovery of neuroinflammatory changes, including dramatic proliferation of activated glia overexpressing a chromosome 2 gene product--the pluripotent immune cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1)--and a chromosome 21 gene product--S100B--in the brains of fetuses, neonates, and children with DS opened the possibility that early events in Alzheimer pathogenesis were driven by cytokines. The specific chromosome 21 gene products and the complexity of the mechanisms they engender that give rise to the neuroinflammatory responses noted in fetal development of the DS brain and their potential as accelerators of Alzheimer neuropathogenesis in DS are topics of this review, particularly as they relate to development and propagation of neuroinflammation, the consequences of which are recognized clinically and neuropathologically as Alzheimer's disease.",

With the belief that the aggregation of Abeta peptides forming higher order oligomers is one of the central pathological pathways in Alzheimer's disease, the formation of the Abeta-heme complex is essential as it inhibits Abeta aggregation and protects the neurons from degradation. In our studies, conventional molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the 1 Abeta + 1 heme and 2 Abeta + 4 hemes system, respectively, with the identification of several dominant binding motifs. We found that hydrophobic residues of the Abeta peptide have a high affinity to interact with heme instead of the histidine residue. We conclude that hydrophobic interaction plays a dominant role in the Abeta-heme complex formation which indirectly serves to physically prevent Abeta aggregation.",

Although this novel, to our knowledge, inhibitory function of transferrin is of potential therapeutic interest for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, the underlying mechanism is still not fully understood. Although it has been shown that the Fe(III) sequestration by transferrin reduces oxidative damage and Abeta aggregation, it is not clear whether transferrin is also able to inhibit Abeta self-association through direct binding of Abeta. Here, using saturation transfer and off-resonance relaxation NMR spectroscopy, we show that transferrin inhibits Abeta aggregation also by preferentially binding Abeta oligomers and outcompeting Abeta monomers that would otherwise cause the growth of the Abeta oligomers into larger assemblies. This inhibitory mechanism is different from the iron-sequestration model, but it is qualitatively similar to a mechanism previously proposed for the inhibition of Abeta self-association by another plasma and cerebrospinal fluid protein, i.e., human serum albumin. These results suggest that Abeta monomer competition through direct Abeta oligomer binding might be a general strategy adopted by proteins in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid to prevent Abeta aggregation.",

    "title": "A two-decade comparison of prevalence of dementia in individuals aged 65 years and older from three geographical areas of England: results of the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study I and II.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dementia is of interest worldwide. Contemporary estimates are needed to plan for future care provision, but much evidence is decades old. We aimed to investigate whether the prevalence of dementia had changed in the past two decades by repeating the same approach and diagnostic methods as used in the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (MRC CFAS) in three of the original study areas in England. METHODS: Between 1989 and 1994, MRC CFAS investigators did baseline interviews in populations aged 65 years and older in six geographically defined areas in England and Wales. A two stage process, with screening followed by diagnostic assessment, was used to obtain data for algorithmic diagnoses (geriatric mental state-automated geriatric examination for computer assisted taxonomy), which were then used to estimate dementia prevalence. Data from three of these areas--Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, and Nottingham--were selected for CFAS I. Between 2008 and 2011, new fieldwork was done in the same three areas for the CFAS II study. For both CFAS I and II, each area needed to include 2500 individuals aged 65 years and older to provide power for geographical and generational comparison. Sampling was stratified according to age group (65-74 years vs >=75 years). CFAS II used identical sampling, approach, and diagnostic methods to CFAS I, except that screening and assessement were combined into one stage. Prevalence estimates were calculated using inverse probability weighting methods to adjust for sampling design and non-response. Full likelihood Bayesian models were used to investigate informative non-response. FINDINGS: 7635 people aged 65 years or older were interviewed in CFAS I (9602 approached, 80% response) in Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, and Nottingham, with 1457 being diagnostically assessed. In the same geographical areas, the CFAS II investigators interviewed 7796 individuals (14,242 approached, 242 with limited frailty information, 56% response). Using CFAS I age and sex specific estimates of prevalence in individuals aged 65 years or older, standardised to the 2011 population, 8 3% (884,000) of this population would be expected to have dementia in 2011. However, CFAS II shows that the prevalence is lower (6 5%; 670,000), a decrease of 1 8% (odds ratio for CFAS II vs CFAS I 0 7, 95% CI 0 6-0 9, p=0 003). Sensitivity analyses suggest that these estimates are robust to the change in response. INTERPRETATION: This study provides further evidence that a cohort effect exists in dementia prevalence. Later-born populations have a lower risk of prevalent dementia than those born earlier in the past century. FUNDING: UK Medical Research Council.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and this can be contributed by aberrant metabolic enzyme function. But, the mechanism causing this enzymatic impairment is unclear. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is known to be alternatively spliced to produce three major isoforms in the brain (APP695, APP751, APP770). Both APP770 and APP751 contain the Kunitz Protease Inhibitory (KPI) domain, but the former also contain an extra OX-2 domain. APP695 on the other hand, lacks both domains. In AD, up-regulation of the KPI-containing APP isoforms has been reported. But the functional contribution of this elevation is unclear. In the present study, we have expressed and compared the effect of the non-KPI containing APP695 and the KPI-containing APP751 on mitochondrial function. We found that the KPI-containing APP751 significantly decreased the expression of three major mitochondrial metabolic enzymes; citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase (COX IV). This reduction lowers the NAD(+)/NADH ratio, COX IV activity and mitochondrial membrane potential. Overall, this study demonstrated that up-regulation of the KPI-containing APP isoforms is likely to contribute to the impairment of metabolic enzymes and mitochondrial function in AD.",

NP-9 is a recently reported monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. In the present study, we found that NP-9 inhibited AChE activity in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal inhibition dose of 8 mg/kg, i.p. It inhibited Abeta aggregation, observed through thioflavin-T assay (IC50=60 muM) and scanning electron microscopy (S.E.M.) (no fibril formation). NP-9 has shown marked protection against scopolamine and Abeta1-42-induced memory impairments. It also minimized neuronal loss and amyloid plaque deposition in the brains of Abeta1-42-induced mice model. Therefore, NP-9 could be a promising lead molecule for AD, with effects against MAO-B, AChE, Abeta aggregation, and Abeta1-42 induced toxicity.",

    "title": "Turnover of amyloid precursor protein family members determines their nuclear signaling capability.",
    "abstract": "The amyloid precursor protein (APP) as well as its homologues, APP-like protein 1 and 2 (APLP1 and APLP2), are cleaved by alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretases, resulting in the release of their intracellular domains (ICDs). We have shown that the APP intracellular domain (AICD) is transported to the nucleus by Fe65 where they jointly bind the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 and localize to spherical nuclear complexes (AFT complexes), which are thought to be sites of transcription. We have now analyzed the subcellular localization and turnover of the APP family members. Similarly to AICD, the ICD of APLP2 localizes to spherical nuclear complexes together with Fe65 and Tip60. In contrast, the ICD of APLP1, despite binding to Fe65, does not translocate to the nucleus. In addition, APLP1 predominantly localizes to the plasma membrane, whereas APP and APLP2 are detected in vesicular structures. APLP1 also demonstrates a much slower turnover of the full-length protein compared to APP and APLP2. We further show that the ICDs of all APP family members are degraded by the proteasome and that the N-terminal amino acids of ICDs determine ICD degradation rate. Together, our results suggest that different nuclear signaling capabilities of APP family members are due to different rates of full-length protein processing and ICD proteasomal degradation. Our results provide evidence in support of a common nuclear signaling function for APP and APLP2 that is absent in APLP1, but suggest that APLP1 has a regulatory role in the nuclear translocation of APP family ICDs due to the sequestration of Fe65.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: gamma-Secretase is the enzyme responsible for the final step of amyloid precursor protein proteolysis to generate Abeta peptides including Abeta42 which is believed to be a toxic species involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. gamma-Secretase modulators (GSMs) have been shown to selectively lower Abeta42 production without affecting total Abeta levels or the formation of gamma-secretase substrate intracellular domains such as APP intracellular domain and Notch intracellular domain. Therefore, GSMs have emerged as an important therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD. AREAS COVERED: The literature covering novel GSMs will be reviewed focusing on patents from 2010 to 2012. EXPERT OPINION: During the last review period (2008 - 2010) considerable progress was made developing GSMs with improved potency for lowering Abeta42 levels, but most of the compounds resided in unfavorable central nervous system (CNS) drug space. In this review period (2010 - 2012), there is a higher percentage of potent GSM chemical matter that resides in favorable CNS drug space. It is anticipated that clinical candidates will emerge out of this cohort that will be able to test the GSM mechanism of action in the clinic.",

In this work we explored the potential of a structure-based drug discovery procedure to target one such system, the soluble monomeric form of the Abeta42 peptide. We utilised for this purpose a set of structures of the Abeta42 peptide selected from clusters of conformations within an ensemble generated by molecular dynamics simulations. Using these structures we carried out fragment mapping calculations to identify binding \"hot spots\" on the monomeric form of the Abeta42 peptide. This procedure provided a set of hot spots with ligand efficiencies comparable to those observed for structured proteins, and clustered into binding pockets. Such binding pockets exhibited a propensity to bind small molecules known to interact with the Abeta42 peptide. Taken together these results provide an initial indication that fragment-based drug discovery may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for diseases associated with the aggregation of intrinsically disordered proteins.",

To pursue mechanisms by which these affect human brain physiology and modify LOAD risk, we initially analysed whole-transcriptome cerebral cortex gene expression data in unaffected APOE4 carriers and LOAD patients. APOE4 carrier status was associated with a consistent transcriptomic shift that broadly resembled the LOAD profile. Differential co-expression correlation network analysis of the APOE4 and LOAD transcriptomic changes identified a set of candidate core regulatory mediators. Several of these--including APBA2, FYN, RNF219 and SV2A--encode known or novel modulators of LOAD associated amyloid beta A4 precursor protein (APP) endocytosis and metabolism. Furthermore, a genetic variant within RNF219 was found to affect amyloid deposition in human brain and LOAD age-of-onset.

Valproic acid, a traditional first-line antiepileptic drug, exerted protective effects in transgenic models of AD. It remains uncertain whether new antiepileptic drugs could reverse neuropathology and behavioral deficits in AD transgenic mice. AIMS: APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice were used in this study, which over express the Swedish mutation of amyloid precursor protein together with presenilin 1 deleted in exon 9. 7-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice were treated daily with 20 mg/kg topiramate (TPM) and 50 mg/kg levetiracetam (LEV) for 30 days by intraperitoneal injection to explore the effects of TPM and LEV on the neuropathology and behavioral deficits. RESULTS: The results indicated that TPM and LEV alleviated behavioral deficits and reduced amyloid plaques in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice. TPM and LEV increased Abeta clearance and up-regulated Abeta transport and autophagic degradation. TPM and LEV inhibited Abeta generation and suppressed gamma-secretase activity. TPM and LEV inhibited GSK-3beta activation and increased the activation of AMPK/Akt activation. Further, TPM and LEV inhibited histone deacetylase activity in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, TPM and LEV might have the potential to treat AD effectively in patient care.",

ESNs enriched with pyramidal neurons were robust, scalable, and amenable to a small-molecule screening assay, overcoming the apparent limitations of neuronal models derived from human pluripotent cells. Small-molecule screening of clinical compounds identified four compounds capable of reducing Abeta levels in ESNs derived from the Tg2576 mouse model of AD.

Using site-directed mutagenesis and S1 pocket-specific chemical inhibitor (compound 2), which was developed for the present study based on in sillico computational modeling, we discovered that the Abeta degradation occurs through S1 pocket but not through S1' pocket responsible for NAAG hydrolysis. Treatment with compound 2 prevented GCPII from Abeta degradation without any impairment in NAAG hydrolysis. Likewise, 2-PMPA (specific GCPII inhibitor developed targeting S1' pocket) completely blocked the NAAG hydrolysis without any effect on Abeta degradation. Pre-incubation with NAAG and Abeta did not affect Abeta degradation and NAAG hydrolysis, respectively.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia but the identification of reliable, early and non-invasive biomarkers remains a major challenge. We present a novel miRNA-based signature for detecting AD from blood samples. RESULTS: We apply next-generation sequencing to miRNAs from blood samples of 48 AD patients and 22 unaffected controls, yielding a total of 140 unique mature miRNAs with significantly changed expression levels. Of these, 82 have higher and 58 have lower abundance in AD patient samples. We selected a panel of 12 miRNAs for an RT-qPCR analysis on a larger cohort of 202 samples, comprising not only AD patients and healthy controls but also patients with other CNS illnesses. These included mild cognitive impairment, which is assumed to represent a transitional period before the development of AD, as well as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, major depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. miRNA target enrichment analysis of the selected 12 miRNAs indicates an involvement of miRNAs in nervous system development, neuron projection, neuron projection development and neuron projection morphogenesis. Using this 12-miRNA signature, we differentiate between AD and controls with an accuracy of 93%, a specificity of 95% and a sensitivity of 92%. The differentiation of AD from other neurological diseases is possible with accuracies between 74% and 78%. The differentiation of the other CNS disorders from controls yields even higher accuracies. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that deregulated miRNAs in blood might be used as biomarkers in the diagnosis of AD or other neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "Sortilin, a Golgi sorting protein and a member of the VPS10P family, is the co-receptor for proneurotrophins, regulates protein trafficking, targets proteins to lysosomes, and regulates low density lipoprotein metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and regulation of sortilin in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A significantly increased level of sortilin was found in human AD brain and in the brains of 6-month-old swedish-amyloid precursor protein/PS1dE9 transgenic mice. Abeta42 enhanced the protein and mRNA expression levels of sortilin in a dose- and time-dependent manner in SH-SY5Y cells, but had no effect on sorLA. In addition, proBDNF also significantly increased the protein and mRNA expression of sortilin in these cells. The recombinant extracellular domain of p75(NTR) (P75ECD-FC), or the antibody against the extracellular domain of p75(NTR), blocked the up-regulation of sortilin induced by Amyloid-beta protein (Abeta), suggesting that Abeta42 increased the expression level of sortilin and mRNA in SH-SY5Y via the p75(NTR) receptor. Inhibition of ROCK, but not Jun N-terminal kinase, suppressed constitutive and Abeta42-induced expression of sortilin. In conclusion, this study shows that sortilin expression is increased in the AD brain in human and mice and that Abeta42 oligomer increases sortilin gene and protein expression through p75(NTR) and RhoA signaling pathways, suggesting a potential physiological interaction of Abeta42 and sortilin in Alzheimer's disease.",

Here, we examine coordination of motor activity by the scaffolding protein JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1), which we find is required for long-range anterograde and retrograde amyloid precursor protein (APP) motility in axons. We identify novel interactions between JIP1 and kinesin heavy chain (KHC) that relieve KHC autoinhibition, activating motor function in single molecule assays. The direct binding of the dynactin subunit p150(Glued) to JIP1 competitively inhibits KHC activation in vitro and disrupts the transport of APP in neurons. Together, these experiments support a model whereby JIP1 coordinates APP transport by switching between anterograde and retrograde motile complexes. We find that mutations in the JNK-dependent phosphorylation site S421 in JIP1 alter both KHC activation in vitro and the directionality of APP transport in neurons. Thus phosphorylation of S421 of JIP1 serves as a molecular switch to regulate the direction of APP transport in neurons.",

    "title": "Heparan sulfate proteoglycans mediate internalization and propagation of specific proteopathic seeds.",
    "abstract": "Recent experimental evidence suggests that transcellular propagation of fibrillar protein aggregates drives the progression of neurodegenerative diseases in a prion-like manner. This phenomenon is now well described in cell and animal models and involves the release of protein aggregates into the extracellular space. Free aggregates then enter neighboring cells to seed further fibrillization. The mechanism by which aggregated extracellular proteins such as tau and alpha-synuclein bind and enter cells to trigger intracellular fibril formation is unknown. Prior work indicates that prion protein aggregates bind heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the cell surface to transmit pathologic processes. Here, we find that tau fibril uptake also occurs via HSPG binding. This is blocked in cultured cells and primary neurons by heparin, chlorate, heparinase, and genetic knockdown of a key HSPG synthetic enzyme, Ext1. Interference with tau binding to HSPGs prevents recombinant tau fibrils from inducing intracellular aggregation and blocks transcellular aggregate propagation. In vivo, a heparin mimetic, F6, blocks neuronal uptake of stereotactically injected tau fibrils. Finally, uptake and seeding by alpha-synuclein fibrils, but not huntingtin fibrils, occurs by the same mechanism as tau. This work suggests a unifying mechanism of cell uptake and propagation for tauopathy and synucleinopathy.",

Proinflammatory molecules produced by activated astrocytes contribute to neuronal damage in AD. Moreover, dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) has been reported to attenuate astroglial activation and exert neuroprotective effects in AD transgenic mice. However, the mechanism by which NBP inhibits activated astrocytes is poorly understood. METHODS: In this study, the primary astrocytes were obtained from the cerebral cortices of 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. The levels of GFAP, COX-2, NF-kappaB, and IkappaBalpha were examined by Western blotting and the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: NBP inhibited the amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced activation of astrocytes and the up-regulation of proinflammatory molecules. Importantly, NBP markedly suppressed Abeta-induced IkappaBalpha degradation and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) translocation. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that NBP attenuates Abeta-induced activation of astrocytes and neuroinflammation via inhibition of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by neuronal loss and cerebral deposition of proteins with altered physicochemical properties. The major proteins are amyloid-beta (Abeta), tau, alpha-synuclein, and TDP-43. Although neuropathological studies on elderly individuals have emphasised the importance of mixed pathologies, there have been few observations on the full spectrum of proteinopathies in the ageing brain. During a community-based study we performed comprehensive mapping of neurodegeneration-related proteins and vascular pathology in the brains of 233 individuals (age at death 77-87; 73 examined clinically in detail). While all brains (from individuals with and without dementia) showed some degree of neurofibrillary degeneration, Abeta deposits were observed only in 160 (68.7 %). Further pathologies included alpha-synucleinopathies (24.9 %), non-Alzheimer tauopathies (23.2 %; including novel forms), TDP-43 proteinopathy (13.3 %), vascular lesions (48.9 %), and others (15.1 %; inflammation, metabolic encephalopathy, and tumours). TDP-43 proteinopathy correlated with hippocampal sclerosis (p < 0.001) and Alzheimer-related pathology (CERAD score and Braak and Braak stages, p = 0.001). The presence of one specific variable (cerebral amyloid angiopathy, Abeta parenchymal deposits, TDP-43 proteinopathy, alpha-synucleinopathy, vascular lesions, non-Alzheimer type tauopathy) did not increase the probability of the co-occurrence of others (p = 0.24). The number of observed pathologies correlated with AD-neuropathologic change (p < 0.0001). In addition to AD-neuropathologic change, tauopathies associated well with dementia, while TDP-43 pathology and alpha-synucleinopathy showed strong effects but lost significance when evaluated together with AD-neuropathologic change. Non-AD neurodegenerative pathologies and their combinations have been underestimated, but are frequent in reality as demonstrated here. This should be considered in diagnostic evaluation of biomarkers, and for better clinical stratification of patients.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta) in senile plaques in the brains of affected patients. Many cellular mechanisms are thought to play important roles in the development and progression of AD. Several lines of evidence point to the dysregulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis as underlying aspects of AD pathogenesis. Moreover, direct roles in the regulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis have been demonstrated for proteins encoded by familial AD-linked genes such as PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP, as well as Abeta peptides. Whereas these studies support the hypothesis that disruption of Ca(2+) homeostasis contributes to AD, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of familial AD-linked genes on Abeta production from their effects on Ca(2+) homeostasis. Here, we developed a system in which cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis could be directly manipulated to study the effects on amyloid precursor protein metabolism and Abeta production. We overexpressed stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and Orai1, the components of the store-operated Ca(2+) entry pathway, to generate cells with constitutive and store depletion-induced Ca(2+) entry. We found striking effects of Ca(2+) entry induced by overexpression of the constitutively active STIM1(D76A) mutant on amyloid precursor protein metabolism. Specifically, constitutive activation of Ca(2+) entry by expression of STIM1(D76A) significantly reduced Abeta secretion. Our results suggest that disruptions in Ca(2+) homeostasis may influence AD pathogenesis directly through the modulation of Abeta production.",

Given that interneuron populations are crucial in olfactory information processing, we have quantitatively analyzed somatostatin- (SOM), parvalbumin- (PV), and calretinin-expressing (CR) cells in the olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, and olfactory tubercle in PS1 x APP double transgenic mice model of AD. The experiments were performed in wild type and double transgenic homozygous animal groups of 2, 4, 6, and 8 months of age to analyze early stages of the pathology. In addition, beta-amyloid (Abeta) expression and its correlation with SOM cells have been quantified under confocal microscopy. The results indicate increasing expressions of Abeta with aging as well as an early fall of SOM and CR expression, whereas PV was decreased later in the disease progression. These observations evidence an early, preferential vulnerability of SOM and CR cells in rostral olfactory structures during AD that may be useful to unravel neural basis of olfactory deficits associated to this neurodegenerative disorder.",

    "title": "In silico and in vitro studies to elucidate the role of Cu2+ and galanthamine as the limiting step in the amyloid beta (1-42) fibrillation process.",
    "abstract": "The formation of fibrils and oligomers of amyloid beta (Abeta) with 42 amino acid residues (Abeta 1-42 ) is the most important pathophysiological event associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The formation of Abeta fibrils and oligomers requires a conformational change from an alpha-helix to a beta-sheet conformation, which is encouraged by the formation of a salt bridge between Asp 23 or Glu 22 and Lys 28. Recently, Cu(2+) and various drugs used for AD treatment, such as galanthamine (Reminyl( ) ), have been reported to inhibit the formation of Abeta fibrils. However, the mechanism of this inhibition remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this work was to explore how Cu(2+) and galanthamine prevent the formation of Abeta1-42 fibrils using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (20 ns) and in vitro studies using fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies. The MD simulations revealed that Abeta1-42 acquires a characteristic U-shape before the alpha-helix to beta-sheet conformational change. The formation of a salt bridge between Asp 23 and Lys 28 was also observed beginning at 5 ns. However, the MD simulations of Abeta 1-42 in the presence of Cu(2+) or galanthamine demonstrated that both ligands prevent the formation of the salt bridge by either binding to Glu 22 and Asp 23 (Cu(2+) ) or to Lys 28 (galanthamine), which prevents Abeta 1-42 from adopting the U-characteristic conformation that allows the amino acids to transition to a beta-sheet conformation. The docking results revealed that the conformation obtained by the MD simulation of a monomer from the 1Z0Q structure can form similar interactions to those obtained from the 2BGE structure in the oligomers. The in vitro studies demonstrated that Abeta remains in an unfolded conformation when Cu(2+) and galanthamine are used. Then, ligands that bind Asp 23 or Glu 22 and Lys 28 could therefore be used to prevent beta turn formation and, consequently, the formation of Abeta fibrils.",

Here we demonstrate that mutations in the transmembrane domain of APP causing aggressive early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease affect both gamma- and epsilon-cleavage sites, by raising the Abeta42/40 ratio and inhibiting the production of AICD50-99, one of the two physiological APP intracellular domains (ICDs). This is in sharp contrast to gamma-secretase modulators, which shift Abeta42 production towards the shorter Abeta38, but unequivocally spare the epsilon-site and APP- and Notch-ICDs production. Molecular simulations suggest that familial Alzheimer's disease mutations modulate the flexibility of the APP transmembrane domain and the presentation of its gamma-site, modifying at the same time, the solvation of the epsilon-site.",

Endosomal traffic is largely controlled by phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, a phosphoinositide synthesized primarily by lipid kinase Vps34. Here we show that phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate is selectively deficient in brain tissue from humans with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease mouse models. Silencing Vps34 causes an enlargement of neuronal endosomes, enhances the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein in these organelles and reduces amyloid precursor protein sorting to intraluminal vesicles. This trafficking phenotype is recapitulated by silencing components of the ESCRT (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport) pathway, including the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate effector Hrs and Tsg101. Amyloid precursor protein is ubiquitinated, and interfering with this process by targeted mutagenesis alters sorting of amyloid precursor protein to the intraluminal vesicles of endosomes and enhances amyloid-beta peptide generation. In addition to establishing phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate deficiency as a contributing factor in Alzheimer's disease, these results clarify the mechanisms of amyloid precursor protein trafficking through the endosomal system in normal and pathological states.",

    "title": "Suppression of Abeta toxicity by puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase is independent of its proteolytic activity.",
    "abstract": "The accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in the brain is one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease and is thought to be of primary aetiological significance. In an unbiased genetic screen, we identified puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA) as a potent suppressor of Abeta toxicity in a Drosophila model system. We established that coexpression of Drosophila PSA (dPSA) in the flies' brains improved their lifespan, protected against locomotor deficits, and reduced brain Abeta levels by clearing the Abeta plaque-like deposits. However, confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation of amyloid-expressing 7PA2 cells demonstrated that PSA localizes to the cytoplasm. Therefore, PSA and Abeta are unlikely to be in the same cellular compartment; moreover, when we artificially placed them in the same compartment in flies, we could not detect a direct epistatic interaction. The consequent hypothesis that PSA's suppression of Abeta toxicity is indirect was supported by the finding that Abeta is not a proteolytic substrate for PSA in vitro. Furthermore, we showed that the enzymatic activity of PSA is not required for rescuing Abeta toxicity in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. We investigated whether the stimulation of autophagy by PSA was responsible for these protective effects. However PSA's promotion of autophagosome fusion with lysosomes required proteolytic activity and so its effect on autophagy is not identical to its protection against Abeta toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta42) plays a key role in the neurotoxicity found in Alzheimer's disease. Mononuclear phagocytes in the brain (microglia), can potentially clear Abeta via phagocytosis. Recently, the shuttling-protein nucleolin has been shown to possess scavenger receptor-activity. Here, we investigated whether this receptor interacts specifically with Abeta type 1-42 and mediates its phagocytosis by microglia. While monomeric and fibril Abeta42 were phagocytosed by mouse microglial EOC2 cells, amyloid beta peptide 1-40 (Abeta40) was only weakly phagocytosed. Surface plasmon-resonance analysis revealed that nucleolin strongly associates with Abeta42, but only weakly associates with Abeta40. Immunofluorescence staining of anti-nucleolin antibody revealed that EOC2 cells and rat primary microglia express nucleolin on their cell surfaces. Further, pretreating EOC2 cells with anti-nucleolin antibody, but not immunoglobulin G (IgG), inhibited phagocytosis of monomeric Abeta42 by microglia. Additionally, nucleolin-transfected HEK293 cells phagocytosed monomeric and fibril Abeta42 but not monomeric and fibril Abeta40. Moreover, AGRO, a nucleolin-specific oligonucleotide aptamer, inhibited phagocytosis of monomeric and fibril Abeta42, but not monomeric and fibril Abeta40. These results indicate that nucleolin is a receptor that allows microglia to recognize monomeric and fibril Abeta42.",

The AN-1792 trial has indicated that Abeta-specific T cells may be unsafe for humans; therefore, other vaccines based on small Abeta epitopes are undergoing preclinical and clinical testing. METHODS: Humoral and cellular immune responses elicited in response to a novel DNA epitope-based vaccine (AV-1955) delivered to rhesus macaques using the TriGrid electroporation device were evaluated. Functional activities of anti-Abeta antibodies generated in response to vaccination were assessed in vitro. RESULTS: AV-1955 generates long-term, potent anti-Abeta antibodies and cellular immune responses specific to foreign T-helper epitopes but not to self-Abeta.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides can self-organize into oligomeric ion channels with high neurotoxicity potential. Cholesterol is believed to play a key role in this process, but the molecular mechanisms linking cholesterol and amyloid channel formation have so far remained elusive. Here, we show that the short Abeta22-35 peptide, which encompasses the cholesterol-binding domain of Abeta, induces a specific increase of Ca(2+) levels in neural cells. This effect is neither observed in calcium-free medium nor in cholesterol-depleted cells, and is inhibited by zinc, a blocker of amyloid channel activity. Double mutations V24G/K28G and N27R/K28R in Abeta22-35 modify cholesterol binding and abrogate channel formation. Molecular dynamic simulations suggest that cholesterol induces a tilted alpha-helical topology of Abeta22-35. This facilitates the establishment of an inter-peptide hydrogen bond network involving Asn-27 and Lys-28, a key step in the octamerization of Abeta22-35 which proceeds gradually until the formation of a perfect annular channel in a phosphatidylcholine membrane. Overall, these data give mechanistic insights into the role of cholesterol in amyloid channel formation, opening up new therapeutic options for Alzheimer's disease.

    "abstract": "We have previously shown that following traumatic brain injury (TBI) the presence of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) may be neuroprotective. APP knockout mice have increased neuronal death and worse cognitive and motor outcomes following TBI, which is rescued by treatment with exogenous sAPPalpha (the secreted ectodomain of APP generated by alpha-secretase cleavage). Two neuroprotective regions were identified in sAPPalpha, the N and C-terminal domains D1 and D6a/E2 respectively. As both D1 and D6a/E2 contain heparin binding activity it was hypothesized that this is responsible for the neuroprotective activity. In this study, we focused on the heparin binding site, encompassed by residues 96-110 in D1, which has previously been shown to have neurotrophic properties. We found that treatment with APP96-110 rescued motor and cognitive deficits in APP-/- mice following focal TBI. APP96-110 also provided neuroprotection in Sprague-Dawley rats following diffuse TBI. Treatment with APP96-110 significantly improved functional outcome as well as preserve histological cellular morphology in APP-/- mice following focal controlled cortical impact injury. Furthermore, following administration of APP96-110 in rats after diffuse impact acceleration TBI, motor and cognitive outcomes were significantly improved and axonal injury reduced. These data define the heparin binding site in the D1 domain of sAPPalpha, represented by the sequence APP96-110, as the neuroprotective site to confer neuroprotection following TBI. The product of alpha-secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein, sAPPalpha is neuroprotective following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Of interest was whether this neuroprotective activity could be further delineated to a heparin binding region within sAPPalpha, corresponding to the region APP96-110 (see diagram demonstrating the domain structure of sAPPalpha). Indeed treatment with APP96-110 improved functional outcome following TBI, an effect that was not seen with a mutated version of the peptide that had reduced heparin binding affinity.",

Neuronal FcgammaRIIb activated ER stress and caspase-12, and Fcgr2b KO primary neurons were resistant to synthetic Abeta-induced cell death in vitro. Fcgr2b deficiency ameliorated Abeta-induced inhibition of long-term potentiation and inhibited the reduction of synaptic density by naturally secreted Abeta. Moreover, genetic depletion of Fcgr2b rescued memory impairments in an AD mouse model. To determine the mechanism of action of FcgammaRIIb in Abeta neurotoxicity, we demonstrated that soluble Abeta oligomers interact with FcgammaRIIb in vitro and in AD brains, and that inhibition of their interaction blocks synthetic Abeta neurotoxicity. We conclude that FcgammaRIIb has an aberrant, but essential, role in Abeta-mediated neuronal dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer [(11)C]Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) is a marker of amyloid plaque deposition in brain, and binding potential is usually quantified using the cerebellum as a reference where the specific binding is negligible. The use of the cerebellum as a reference, however, has been questioned by the reported cerebellar [(11)C]PIB retention in familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. In this work, we developed a supervised clustering procedure for the automatic extraction of a reference region in [(11)C]PIB studies. Supervised clustering models each gray matter voxel as the linear combination of three predefined kinetic classes, normal and lesion gray matter, and blood pool, and extract reference voxels in which the contribution of the normal gray matter class is high. In the validation with idiopathic AD subjects, supervised clustering extracted reference voxels mostly in the cerebellum that indicated little specific [(11)C]PIB binding, and total distribution volumes of the extracted region were lower than those of the cerebellum. Next, the methodology was applied to the familial AD cohort where the cerebellar amyloid load had been demonstrated previously, resulting in higher binding potential compared with that obtained with the cerebellar reference. The supervised clustering method is a useful tool for the accurate quantification of [(11)C]PIB studies.",

Several proteins including metabotropic glutamate type 5 receptors (mGluR5s) contribute to this process. We observed an overexpression of mGluR5s in reactive astrocytes surrounding Abeta plaques in brain sections from an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. In a simplified cell culture system, using immunocytochemistry and single molecule imaging, we demonstrated a rapid binding of Abeta oligomers on the plasma membrane of astrocytes. The resulting aggregates of Abeta oligomers led to the diffusional trapping and clustering of mGluR5s. Further, Abeta oligomers induced an increase in ATP release following activation of astroglial mGluR5s by its agonist. ATP slowed mGluR5s diffusion in astrocytes as well as in neurons co-cultured with astrocytes. This effect, which is purinergic receptor-dependent, was not observed in pure neuronal cultures. Thus, Abeta oligomer- and mGluR5-dependent ATP release by astrocytes may contribute to the overall deleterious effect of mGluR5s in Alzheimer's disease. GLIA 2013;61:1673-1686.",

The control of the peptide self-assembly is difficult to achieve because the process is fast and is affected by many variables.

The characterization of the peptide-surfactant interactions by ultra-structural analysis, thioflavin T assay and secondary structure analysis, suggested that charged surfactants interact with Abeta(1-42) through electrostatic interactions.

    "title": "Glucose levels and risk of dementia.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a risk factor for dementia. It is unknown whether higher glucose levels increase the risk of dementia in people without diabetes. METHODS: We used 35,264 clinical measurements of glucose levels and 10,208 measurements of glycated hemoglobin levels from 2067 participants without dementia to examine the relationship between glucose levels and the risk of dementia. Participants were from the Adult Changes in Thought study and included 839 men and 1228 women whose mean age at baseline was 76 years; 232 participants had diabetes, and 1835 did not. We fit Cox regression models, stratified according to diabetes status and adjusted for age, sex, study cohort, educational level, level of exercise, blood pressure, and status with respect to coronary and cerebrovascular diseases, atrial fibrillation, smoking, and treatment for hypertension. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 6.8 years, dementia developed in 524 participants (74 with diabetes and 450 without). Among participants without diabetes, higher average glucose levels within the preceding 5 years were related to an increased risk of dementia (P=0.01); with a glucose level of 115 mg per deciliter (6.4 mmol per liter) as compared with 100 mg per deciliter (5.5 mmol per liter), the adjusted hazard ratio for dementia was 1.18 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 1.33). Among participants with diabetes, higher average glucose levels were also related to an increased risk of dementia (P=0.002); with a glucose level of 190 mg per deciliter (10.5 mmol per liter) as compared with 160 mg per deciliter (8.9 mmol per liter), the adjusted hazard ratio was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.12 to 1.76). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that higher glucose levels may be a risk factor for dementia, even among persons without diabetes. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.)",

    "abstract": "alpha-Synuclein (alpha-syn) is a protein prevalent in neural tissue and known to undergo axonal transport. Intracellular alpha-syn aggregates are a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD). Braak and collaborators have suggested that in people who are destined to eventually develop PD, alpha-syn aggregate pathology progresses following a stereotypic pattern, starting in the olfactory bulb (OB) and the gut. alpha-Synuclein aggregates are postulated to spread to interconnected brain regions over several years. Thus, propagation of the pathology via neural pathways can potentially explain how alpha-syn aggregates spread in PD. We have now studied if alpha-syn can transfer from the OB to other brain structures through neural connections, by injecting different molecular species of human alpha-syn (monomers, oligomers, fibrils) into the OB of wild-type mice. We found that non-fibrillar human alpha-syn is taken up very quickly by OB neurons. Within minutes to hours, it is also found in neurons in structures connected to the OB. Conversely, when we injected bovine serum albumin used as a control protein, we found that it does not diffuse beyond the OB, is rarely taken up by OB cells, and does not transfer to other structures. Taken together, our results show that OB cells readily take up alpha-syn, and that monomeric and oligomeric, but not fibrillar, forms of alpha-syn are rapidly transferred to interconnected structures within the timeframe we explored. Our results support the idea that alpha-syn can transfer along neural pathways and thereby contribute to the progression of the alpha-syn-related pathology.",

    "abstract": "Increased processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the identification of molecules that regulate Abeta generation is crucial for future therapeutic approaches for AD. We demonstrated previously that RanBP9 regulates Abeta generation in a number of cell lines and primary neuronal cultures by forming tripartite protein complexes with APP, low-density lipoprotein-related protein, and BACE1, consequently leading to increased amyloid plaque burden in the brain. RanBP9 is a scaffold protein that exists and functions in multiprotein complexes. To identify other proteins that may bind RanBP9 and regulate Abeta levels, we used a two-hybrid analysis against a human brain cDNA library and identified COPS5 as a novel RanBP9-interacting protein. This interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells and mouse brain. Colocalization of COPS5 and RanBP9 in the same subcellular compartments further supported the interaction of both proteins. Furthermore, like RanBP9, COPS5 robustly increased Abeta generation, followed by increased soluble APP-beta (sAPP-beta) and decreased soluble-APP-alpha (sAPP-alpha) levels. Most importantly, down-regulation of COPS5 by siRNAs reduced Abeta generation, implying that endogenous COPS5 regulates Abeta generation. Finally, COPS5 levels were increased significantly in AD brains and APDeltaE9 transgenic mice, and overexpression of COPS5 strongly increased RanBP9 protein levels by increasing its half-life. Taken together, these results suggest that COPS5 increases Abeta generation by increasing RanBP9 levels. Thus, COPS5 is a novel RanBP9-binding protein that increases APP processing and Abeta generation by stabilizing RanBP9 protein levels.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) chiefly characterizes a progressively neurodegenerative disorder of the brain, and eventually leads to irreversible loss of intellectual abilities. The beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced neurodegeneration is believed to be the main pathological mechanism of AD, and Abeta production inhibition or its clearance promotion is one of the promising therapeutic strategies for anti-AD research. Here, we report that the natural product arctigenin from Arctium lappa (L.) can both inhibit Abeta production by suppressing beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleavage enzyme 1 expression and promote Abeta clearance by enhancing autophagy through AKT/mTOR signaling inhibition and AMPK/Raptor pathway activation as investigated in cells and APP/PS1 transgenic AD model mice. Moreover, the results showing that treatment of arctigenin in mice highly decreased Abeta formation and senile plaques and efficiently ameliorated AD mouse memory impairment strongly highlight the potential of arctigenin in anti-AD drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid oligomers play a central role in Alzheimer's and other amyloid diseases, and yet the structures of these heterogeneous and unstable species are not well understood. To better understand the structures of oligomers formed by amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), we have incorporated a key amyloidogenic region of Abeta into a macrocyclic peptide that stabilizes oligomers and facilitates structural elucidation by X-ray crystallography. This paper reports the crystallographic structures of oligomers and oligomer assemblies formed by a macrocycle containing the Abeta(15-23) nonapeptide. The macrocycle forms hydrogen-bonded beta-sheets that assemble into cruciform tetramers consisting of eight beta-strands in a two-layered assembly. Three of the cruciform tetramers assemble into a triangular dodecamer. These oligomers further assemble in the lattice to form hexagonal pores. Molecular modeling studies suggest that the natural Abeta peptide can form similar oligomers and oligomer assemblies. The crystallographic and molecular modeling studies suggest the potential for interaction of the oligomers with cell membranes and provide insights into the role of oligomers in amyloid diseases.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression has been well established in terms of epidemiological and clinical observations. Depression has been considered to be both a symptom and risk factor of AD. Several genetic and neurobiological mechanisms have been described to underlie these two disorders. Despite the accumulating knowledge on this topic, the precise neuropathological mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this study, we propose that synaptic degeneration plays an important role in the disease progression of depression and AD. Using primary culture of hippocampal neurons treated with oligomeric Abeta and corticosterone as model agents for AD and depression, respectively, we found significant changes in the pre-synaptic vesicle proteins synaptophysin and synaptotagmin. We further investigated whether the observed protein changes affected synaptic functions. By using FM( )4-64 fluorescent probe, we showed that synaptic functions were compromised in treated neurons. Our findings led us to investigate the involvement of protein degradation mechanisms in mediating the observed synaptic protein abnormalities, namely, the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy. We found up-regulation of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, and the preferential signaling for the autophagic-lysosomal degradation pathway. Lastly, we investigated the neuroprotective role of different classes of antidepressants. Our findings demonstrated that the antidepressants Imipramine and Escitalopram were able to rescue the observed synaptic protein damage. In conclusion, our study shows that synaptic degeneration is an important common denominator underlying depression and AD, and alleviation of this pathology by antidepressants may be therapeutically beneficial.",

However, as both APP/BACE-1 are highly expressed in brain, mechanisms precluding their unabated convergence are unclear. Exploring dynamic localization of APP/BACE-1 in cultured hippocampal neurons, we found that after synthesis via the secretory pathway, dendritic APP/BACE-1-containing vesicles are largely segregated in physiologic states. While BACE-1 is sorted into acidic recycling endosomes, APP is conveyed in Golgi-derived vesicles. However, upon activity induction-a known trigger of the amyloidogenic pathway-APP is routed into BACE-1-positive recycling endosomes via a clathrin-dependent mechanism. A partitioning/convergence of APP/BACE-1 vesicles is also apparent in control/AD brains, respectively. Considering BACE-1 is optimally active in an acidic environment, our experiments suggest that neurons have evolved trafficking strategies that normally limit APP/BACE-1 proximity and also uncover a pathway routing APP into BACE-1-containing organelles, triggering amyloidogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Relying on a combination of classical molecular dynamics and hybrid QM/MM computational methods, we study the influence of the nature of the local physico-chemical environment on the structural features of beta-amyloid peptides complexed with Zn(+2) ions. The analysis is carried out by comparing among themselves different Zn(+2)-ligand force fields and studying their influence on metal coordination and long-range peptide folding. The system in the non-physiological so-called \"gas phase\" (no solvent) was also simulated with the purpose of identifying to what extent, if at all, the solvent can affect the Zn coordination mode, besides its long-range structural properties. There are two main results of this investigation. The first is that the Zn(+2) coordination mode in classical molecular dynamics simulations markedly depends on the partial charge attributed to the ion and the atoms surrounding it. Comparing with experiments, it is possible to identify the most appropriate Zn(+2) force field for the Zn(+2)-Abeta1-16 complex in study. Secondly, although the presence of water naturally influences the peptide folding propensity, it does not affect the structure of the Zn(+2) inner coordination shell. A useful way to validate classical results and in particular those referring to the structural differences visible when different force fields are employed, was to use a hybrid QM/MM optimization step. When the classical system configurations are submitted to such a quantum minimization step, the geometries of the resulting Zn(+2) site turn out to be all very similar and structurally in good agreement with what is experimentally known.",

Here, it is applied to the analysis of double-stained Abeta amyloid plaques being related to the Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sections of APP/PS1 AD mice model brains are double stained with luminescent-conjugated oligothiophenes, known to bind to amyloid protein deposits. Hyperspectral fluorescence images of the brain sections are recorded and by applying the correlation algorithm the spectral inhomogeneity of the double-stained samples is mapped in terms of radial distribution and spectral content. To further investigate the progression of Abeta amyloid plaque formation, 19 AD mice of different ages up to 23 months are characterized, enabling a statistical analysis of the plaque heterogeneity. In accordance with recent findings by Nystrom et al. [ACS Chem. Biol. 8, 1128-1133 (2013)], the spectral distribution within Abeta plaques is found to vary with age throughout the lifespan of the mouse. With the new correlation algorithm, it is possible to quantify the spectral abundance of the two stains depending on the relative distance from the plaque center and mouse age. Thus, we demonstrate the use of the correlation analysis approach in double-staining experiments and how it is possible to relate these to structural/spectral changes in biological samples.",

After intraperitoneal injection of enflurane, the Morris water maze and the step-down passive avoidance tests were conducted to test the cognitive ability and memory. The enflurane group showed prolonged escape latency, extended space exploration time and increased number of errors at early stage after enflurane anesthesia, suggesting that enflurane should be responsible for the impairment of cognition in aged rats. In addition, we analyzed the expression level of beta-amyloid and phosphorylation level of tau in the hippocampus by immunoblotting. Interestingly, the levels of beta-amyloid and phosphorylated tau in the hippocampus increased significantly at early stage and then restored to pre-anesthetic levels. Taken together, our results suggest that increasing of beta-amyloid and phosphorylation of tau are important to cause cognitive decline in aged rats during initial stage after enflurane anesthesia.",

    "title": "Tropisetron attenuates amyloid-beta-induced inflammatory and apoptotic responses in rats.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder featured by deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques in the hippocampus and associated cortices and progressive cognitive decline. Tropisetron, a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, is conventionally used to counteract chemotherapy-induced emesis. Recent investigations describe antiphlogistic properties for tropisetron. It has been shown that tropisetron protects against rat embolic stroke. We investigated protective properties of tropisetron in a beta-amyloid (Abeta) rat model of AD and possible involvement of 5-HT3 receptors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Abeta (1-42) was injected into the hippocampus of male rats. Animals were treated intracerebroventricularly with tropisetron, mCPBG (selective 5-HT3 receptor agonist) or mCPBG plus tropisetron on days 1, 3, 5 and 7. Seven days following Abeta administration, inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, COX-2, iNOS and NF-kappaB), apoptotic markers (caspase 3 cytochrome c release) and calcineurin phosphatase activity were assessed in hippocampus. RESULTS: Seven days following Abeta inoculation, control animals displayed dramatic increase in TNF-alpha, COX-2, iNOS, NF-kappaB, active caspase 3, cytochrome c release and calcineurin phosphatase activity in the hippocampus. Tropisetron significantly diminished the elevated levels of these markers and reversed the cognitive deficit. Interestingly, tropisetron was also found to be a potent inhibitor of calcineurin phosphatase activity. The selective 5-HT3 receptor agonist mCPBG, when co-administered with tropisetron, completely reversed the procognitive and anti-apoptotic properties of tropisetron while it could only partially counteract the anti-inflammatory effects. mCPBG alone significantly aggravated Abeta-induced injury. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that tropisetron protects against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in vivo through both 5-HT3 receptor-dependent and independent pathways.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Several methods are in use for analyzing (11)C-Pittsburgh compound-B ((11)C-PiB) data. The objective of this study was to identify the method of choice for measuring longitudinal changes in specific (11)C-PiB binding. METHODS: Dynamic 90-min (11)C-PiB baseline and follow-up scans (interval, 30 +- 5 mo) were obtained for 7 Alzheimer disease (AD) patients, 11 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 11 healthy controls. Parametric images were generated using reference parametric mapping (RPM2), reference Logan values, and standardized uptake value volume ratios (SUVr), the latter for intervals between 60 and 90 (SUVr(60-90)) and 40 and 60 (SUVr(40-60)) minutes after injection. In all analyses, cerebellar gray matter was used as a reference region. A global cortical volume of interest was defined using a probability map-based template. Percentage change between baseline and follow-up was derived for all analytic methods. RESULTS: SUVr(60-90) and SUVr(40-60) overestimated binding with 13% and 10%, respectively, compared with RPM2. Reference Logan values were on average 6% lower than RPM2. Both SUVr measures showed high intersubject variability. Over time, R1, the delivery of tracer to the cortex relative to that to the cerebellum, decreased in AD patients (P < 0.05) but not in MCI patients and controls. Simulations showed that SUVr, but not RPM2 and reference Logan values, was highly dependent on uptake period and that changes in SUVr over time were sensitive to changes in flow. CONCLUSION: To reliably assess amyloid binding over time--for example, in drug intervention studies--it is essential to use fully quantitative methods for data acquisition and analysis.",

In this short report, I discuss the hypothesis that mutation of Tyr682 on the Y682 ENPTY687 C-terminal motif of APP may be directly or indirectly associated with alterations in APP functioning and activity, leading to neuronal defects and deficits. Mutation of Tyr682 induces an early and progressive age-dependent cognitive and locomotor decline that is associated with a loss of synaptic connections, a decrease in cholinergic tone, and defects in NGF signaling. These findings support a model in which APP-C-terminal domain exerts a pathogenic function in neuronal development and decline, and suggest that Tyr682 potentially could modulate the properties of APP metabolites in humans.",

    "title": "CD33 Alzheimer's risk-altering polymorphism, CD33 expression, and exon 2 splicing.",
    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies are identifying novel Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors. Elucidating the mechanism underlying these polymorphisms is critical to the validation process and, by identifying rate-limiting steps in AD risk, may yield novel therapeutic targets. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of action of the AD-associated polymorphism rs3865444 in the promoter of CD33, a member of the sialic acid-binding Ig-superfamily of lectins (SIGLECs). Immunostaining established that CD33 is expressed in microglia in human brain. Consistent with this finding, CD33 mRNA expression correlated well with expression of the microglial genes CD11b and AIF-1 and was modestly increased with AD status and the rs3865444C AD-risk allele. Analysis of CD33 isoforms identified a common isoform lacking exon 2 (D2-CD33). The proportion of CD33 expressed as D2-CD33 correlated robustly with rs3865444 genotype. Because rs3865444 is in the CD33 promoter region, we sought the functional polymorphism by sequencing CD33 from the promoter through exon 4. We identified a single polymorphism that is coinherited with rs3865444, i.e., rs12459419 in exon 2. Minigene RNA splicing studies in BV2 microglial cells established that rs12459419 is a functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that modulates exon 2 splicing efficiency. Thus, our primary findings are that CD33 is a microglial mRNA and that rs3865444 is a proxy SNP for rs12459419 that modulates CD33 exon 2 splicing. Exon 2 encodes the CD33 IgV domain that typically mediates sialic acid binding in SIGLEC family members. In summary, these results suggest a novel model wherein SNP-modulated RNA splicing modulates CD33 function and, thereby, AD risk.",

    "abstract": "The decline of cognitive function has emerged as one of the greatest health threats of old age. Age-related cognitive decline is caused by an impacted neuronal circuitry, yet the molecular mechanisms responsible are unknown. C1q, the initiating protein of the classical complement cascade and powerful effector of the peripheral immune response, mediates synapse elimination in the developing CNS. Here we show that C1q protein levels dramatically increase in the normal aging mouse and human brain, by as much as 300-fold. This increase was predominantly localized in close proximity to synapses and occurred earliest and most dramatically in certain regions of the brain, including some but not all regions known to be selectively vulnerable in neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., the hippocampus, substantia nigra, and piriform cortex. C1q-deficient mice exhibited enhanced synaptic plasticity in the adult and reorganization of the circuitry in the aging hippocampal dentate gyrus. Moreover, aged C1q-deficient mice exhibited significantly less cognitive and memory decline in certain hippocampus-dependent behavior tests compared with their wild-type littermates. Unlike in the developing CNS, the complement cascade effector C3 was only present at very low levels in the adult and aging brain. In addition, the aging-dependent effect of C1q on the hippocampal circuitry was independent of C3 and unaccompanied by detectable synapse loss, providing evidence for a novel, complement- and synapse elimination-independent role for C1q in CNS aging.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide from its monomeric to its fibrillar form importantly contributes to the development of Alzheimer's disease. Here, we investigated the effects of Escherichia coli maltose binding protein (MBP), which has been previously used as a fusion protein, on Abeta42 fibrillization, in order to improve understanding of the self-assembly process and the cytotoxic mechanism of Abeta42. MBP, at a sub-stoichiometric ratio with respect to Abeta42, was found to have chaperone-like inhibitory effects on beta-sheet fibril formation, due to the accumulation of Abeta42 aggregates by sequestration of active Abeta42 species as Abeta42-MBP complexes. Furthermore, MBP increased the lag time of Abeta42 polymerization, decreased the growth rate of fibril extension, and suppressed Abeta42 mediated toxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. It appears that MBP decreases the active concentration of Abeta42 by sequestering it as Abeta42-MBP complex, and that this sequestration suppresses ongoing nucleation and retards the growth rate of Abeta42 species required for fibril formation. We speculate that inhibition of the growth rate of potent Abeta42 species by MBP suppresses Abeta42-mediated toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells.",

    "abstract": "Increased activity of L-type Ca2+ channels has been implicated in the pathogenesis of dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously we detected CaV1.2 alpha1-subunit-positive expression in reactive astrocytes surrounding the plaques of 12 month-old transgenic mice overexpressing hAbetaPP751 with the London (V717I) and Swedish (K670M/N671L) mutations. Here we examined whether increased CaV1.2 alpha1-subunit expression precedes plaque formation or is specifically associated with the increased amyloid-beta (Abeta) load in the plaques. Quantitative RT-PCR expression profiling of all high voltage-gated Ca2+ channel subunits (alpha1, beta, and alpha2delta) revealed no difference in the hippocampi of 2, 4, and 11 month-old wild type (wt) and transgenic (tg) mice. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that expression of CaV1.2 alpha1-subunit, but not of the auxiliary beta4 Ca2+ channel subunit, specifically associated with Abeta-positive plaques in brains of 11 month tg mice. No difference in CaV1.2 alpha1-subunit labeling was found in 2 and 4 month-old wt and tg mice prior to plaque formation. The CaV1.2 alpha1-subunit-positive cells in 11 month-old tg mice also labeled with GFAP, but not with the microglia marker Iba1. In contrast, GFAP-positive cells induced by injection of quinolinic acid did not reveal any CaV1.2 alpha1-subunit immunoreactivity. Together these results indicate that the expression of CaV1.2 alpha1-subunits in reactive astrocytes in the tg AD mouse model is related to the increased amyloid-beta load in the plaques rather than caused by effects on gene regulation or mechanisms preceding the manifestation of AD as seen by plaque formation.",

    "title": "Early intervention with an estrogen receptor beta-selective phytoestrogenic formulation prolongs survival, improves spatial recognition memory, and slows progression of amyloid pathology in a female mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Our recent developments have yielded a novel phytoestrogenic formulation, referred to as the phyto-beta-SERM formulation, which exhibits an 83-fold binding selectivity for the estrogen receptor subtype beta (ERbeta) over ERalpha. Earlier studies indicate that the phyto-beta-SERM formulation is neuroprotective and promotes estrogenic mechanisms in the brain while devoid of feminizing activity in the periphery. Further investigation in a mouse model of human menopause indicates that chronic exposure to the phyto-beta-SERM formulation at a clinically relevant dosage prevents/alleviates menopause-related climacteric symptoms. This study assessed the efficacy, in an early intervention paradigm, of the phyto-beta-SERM formulation in the regulation of early stages of physical and neurological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a female triple transgenic mouse model of AD. Results demonstrated that, when initiated prior to the appearance of AD pathology, a 9-month dietary supplementation with the phyto-beta-SERM formulation promoted physical health, prolonged survival, improved spatial recognition memory, and attenuated amyloid-beta deposition and plaque formation in the brains of treated AD mice. In comparison, dietary supplementation of a commercial soy extract preparation showed no effect on cognitive measures, although it appeared to have a positive impact on amyloid pathology. In overall agreement with the behavioral and histological outcomes, results from a gene expression profiling analysis offered insights on the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with the two dietary treatments. In particular, the data suggests that there may be a crosstalk between ERbeta and glycogen synthase kinase 3 signaling pathways that could play a role in conferring ERbeta-mediated neuroprotection against AD. Taken together, these results support the therapeutic potential of the phyto-beta-SERM formulation for prevention and/or early intervention of AD, and warrants further investigations in human studies.",

This article reviews publications on the clinical neurological phenotype of PSEN1 mutations published between October 2008 and April 2013 and integrates this information with previous reviews to produce tabular summaries of phenotype and genotype. With the possible exception of \"variant AD\" (familial AD with spastic paraparesis), no clinical genotype-phenotype correlations are obvious. The mechanisms underpinning the clinical heterogeneity associated with PSEN1 mutations remain unclear. The \"presenilin hypothesis\" posits a loss of essential presenilin protein functions as a consequence of gene mutation, which might be one factor influencing disease phenotype.",

    "abstract": "St. John's wort has been the subject of studies focused on its therapeutic properties against several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), a critical peptide in AD, has been linked to the mitochondrial dysfunction often observed in this disease. Despite many efforts to prevent Abeta levels from increasing in AD, less has been done regarding the mitochondrial component. Therefore, we studied the effects of tetrahydrohyperforin (THH) on mitochondrial dysfunction of hippocampal neurons, challenged with Abeta oligomers (Abetao) and Abetao-AChE complexes. We show that THH prevents mitochondrial calcium overload and induces the modulation of fusion-fission events, arresting mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, our results suggest that the modulation of mitochondrial dynamics probably occurs through a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1alpha-mediated mechanism, inducing mitochondrial fusion-fission protein expression. Our results offer further explanation for the effects observed for THH and the beneficial effects of this ethno-botanical drug in AD.",

This protein remains an important potential disease-modifying target for the development of drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). We are pursuing potent BACE1 inhibitors in an effort to identify suitable AD drug candidates. Our results have shown that the novel compound VIa exhibits potent inhibitory effects with IC50 = 5.9 nM and displays 30.8-fold, 7500-fold and 17533-fold selectivity against the other aspartic proteases BACE2, cathepsin D and renin, respectively. In cellular assays, VIa moderately reduces Abeta production: Abeta(1-40) with an IC50 = 143 nM and 1 nM VIa reduced Abeta(1-42) by 40.17%. Concomitant with VIa inhibiting the beta-cleavage of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP), VIa increases the production of sAbetaPPalpha with an approximate EC50 of 16.5 nM. In testing this compound's efficacy in vivo, the oral administration of VIa resulted in a significant decrease in Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) in the blood of a mouse model of AD by 17.5-72.44% and 14.5-80.32%, respectively. This indicates that the novel compound VIa is a small, potent, selective, and non-peptidic BACE1 inhibitor.",

Here, we reported that in BV-2 cells, genistein significantly inhibited beta amyloid peptides 25-35 (Abeta25-35)-induced inflammatory response. The results indicated that Abeta25-35-stimulated BV-2 cells upregulated Toll-like receptors 2 and 4, Myd88, and IKK gene expression with the increasing expression of IL-6 and decreasing expression of TGF-beta and IL-10. Further, inhibiting TLR4 expression with small interfering RNA prevented the inflammatory response induced by Abeta25-35, indicating the key role of TLRs in Abeta-mediated inflammation. Genistein pre-treated BV-2 cells showed less inflammatory response when exposed to Abeta25-35. These results suggested that Abeta induced BV-2 cells inflammation though TLRs and genistein has an anti-inflammatory effect in vitro.",

    "title": "Lipid bilayers significantly modulate cross-fibrillation of two distinct amyloidogenic peptides.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid plaques comprising misfolded proteins are the hallmark of several incurable diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, type-II diabetes, Jacob-Creutzfeld disease, and others. While the exact molecular mechanisms underlying protein misfolding diseases are still unknown, several theories account for amyloid fiber formation and their toxic significance. Prominent among those is the \"prion hypothesis\" stipulating that misfolded protein seeds act as \"infectious agents\" propagating aggregation of nominally healthy, native proteins. Recent studies, in fact, have reported that interactions between different amyloid peptides that are partly sequence-related might also affect fibrillation pathways and pathogenicity. Here, we present evidence that two structurally and physiologically unrelated amyloidogenic peptides, the islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP, the peptide comprising the amyloid aggregates in type II diabetes) and an amyloidogenic determinant of the prion protein (PrP), give rise to a significantly distinct fibrillation pathway when they are incubated together in the presence of membrane bilayers. In particular, the experimental data demonstrate that the lipid bilayer environment is instrumental in initiating and promoting the assembly of morphologically distinct fibrillar species. Moreover, cross-fibrillation produced peptide species exhibiting significantly altered membrane interaction profiles, as compared to the scenario where the two peptides aggregated separately. Overall, our data demonstrate that membranes constitute a critical surface-active medium for promoting interactions between disparate amyloidogenic peptides, modulating both fibrillation pathways as well as the biophysical properties of the peptide aggregates. This work hints that membrane-induced cross-fibrillation of unrelated amyloidogenic peptides might play an insidious role in the molecular pathologies of protein misfolding diseases.",

Here, we evaluated the efficacy of simvastatin in bitransgenic A/T mice overexpressing a mutated form of the human amyloid precursor protein (APP(Swe,Ind)) and a constitutively active form of transforming growth factor-beta1. These mice feature the AD amyloid beta (Abeta) and cerebrovascular pathology. Simvastatin significantly decreased insoluble Abeta peptide levels and Abeta plaque load despite no effect on beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme and Abeta-degrading enzyme neprilysin protein levels. However, simvastatin failed to improve spatial learning and memory deficits and the decreased baseline levels of the memory-related protein early growth response-1 (Egr-1) in the hippocampus CA1 area. The impaired hyperemic response to whisker stimulation in A/T mice was not improved with treatment, but simvastatin fully restored constitutive nitric oxide synthesis in vessel walls and exacerbated agonist-mediated dilatory deficits. These findings point to the efficacy of simvastatin on selective AD features in a complex model of the disease, likely reflecting the challenges faced by recent clinical trials in assessing statin efficacy.",

The mechanisms leading to decreased alpha-secretase activity in Alzheimer's and prion disease remain unclear. Here, we find that tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE)-mediated alpha-secretase activity is impaired at the surface of neurons infected with PrP(Sc) or isolated from APP-transgenic mice with amyloid pathology. 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) activity is increased in neurons infected with prions or affected by Abeta deposition and in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. PDK1 induces phosphorylation and caveolin-1-mediated internalization of TACE. This dysregulation of TACE increases PrP(Sc) and Abeta accumulation and reduces shedding of TNF-alpha receptor type 1 (TNFR1). Inhibition of PDK1 promotes localization of TACE to the plasma membrane, restores TACE-dependent alpha-secretase activity and cleavage of APP, PrP(C) and TNFR1, and attenuates PrP(Sc)- and Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. In mice, inhibition or siRNA-mediated silencing of PDK1 extends survival and reduces motor impairment following PrP(Sc) infection and in APP-transgenic mice reduces Alzheimer's disease-like pathology and memory impairment.",

    "abstract": "Strong epidemiological and experimental evidence indicate that hypertension in the elderly predisposes to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. The present study was designed to characterize the additive/synergistic effects of hypertension and aging on the expression of genes involved in beta-amyloid generation and AD in the hippocampus, an area of brain contributing to higher cognitive function, which is significantly affected by AD both in humans and in mouse models of the disease. To achieve that goal, we induced hypertension in young (3 mo) and aged (24 mo) C57BL/6 mice by chronic (4 wk) infusion of angiotensin II and assessed changes in hippocampal mRNA expression of genes involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-dependent signaling, APP cleavage, Abeta processing and Abeta-degradation, synaptic function, dysregulation of microtubule-associated tau protein, and apolipoprotein-E signaling. Aged hypertensive mice exhibited spatial memory impairments in the Y-maze and impaired performance in the novel object recognition assay. Surprisingly, hypertension in aging did not increase the expression of APP, beta- and gamma-secretases, or genes involved in tauopathy. These genes are all involved in the early onset form of AD. Yet, hypertension in aging was associated with changes in hippocampal expression of APP binding proteins, e.g., [Mint3/amyloid beta A4 precursor protein-binding family A member 3 (APBA3), Fe65/amyloid beta A4 precursor protein-binding family B member 1 (APBB1)], amyloid beta (A4) precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1), muscarinic M1 receptor, and serum amyloid P component, all of which may have a role in the pathogenesis of late-onset AD. The hippocampal gene expression signature observed in aged hypertensive mice in the present study provides important clues for subsequent studies to elucidate the mechanisms by which hypertension may contribute to the pathogenesis and clinical manifestation of AD.",

    "title": "Low levels of copper disrupt brain amyloid-beta homeostasis by altering its production and clearance.",
    "abstract": "Whereas amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulates in the brain of normal animals dosed with low levels of copper (Cu), the mechanism is not completely known. Cu could contribute to Abeta accumulation by altering its clearance and/or its production. Because Cu homeostasis is altered in transgenic mice overexpressing Abeta precursor protein (APP), the objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of Cu-induced Abeta accumulation in brains of normal mice and then to explore Cu's effects in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. In aging mice, accumulation of Cu in brain capillaries was associated with its reduction in low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), an Abeta transporter, and higher brain Abeta levels. These effects were reproduced by chronic dosing with low levels of Cu via drinking water without changes in Abeta synthesis or degradation. In human brain endothelial cells, Cu, at its normal labile levels, caused LRP1-specific down-regulation by inducing its nitrotyrosination and subsequent proteosomal-dependent degradation due in part to Cu/cellular prion protein/LRP1 interaction. In APP(sw/0) mice, Cu not only down-regulated LRP1 in brain capillaries but also increased Abeta production and neuroinflammation because Cu accumulated in brain capillaries and, unlike in control mice, in the parenchyma. Thus, we have demonstrated that Cu's effect on brain Abeta homeostasis depends on whether it is accumulated in the capillaries or in the parenchyma. These findings should provide unique insights into preventative and/or therapeutic approaches to control neurotoxic Abeta levels in the aging brain.",

To investigate the formation of these aggregates in solution, we designed an MS-based biophysical approach and applied it to the formation of soluble aggregates of the Abeta42 peptide, the proposed causative agent in Alzheimer's disease. The approach incorporates pulsed hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled with MS analysis. The combined approach provides evidence for a self-catalyzed aggregation with a lag phase, as observed previously by fluorescence methods. Unlike those approaches, pulsed hydrogen-deuterium exchange does not require modified Abeta42 (e.g., labeling with a fluorophore). Furthermore, the approach reveals that the center region of Abeta42 is first to aggregate, followed by the C and N termini. We also found that the lag phase in the aggregation of soluble species is affected by temperature and Cu(2+) ions. This MS approach has sufficient structural resolution to allow interrogation of Abeta aggregation in physiologically relevant environments. This platform should be generally useful for investigating the aggregation of other amyloid-forming proteins and neurotoxic soluble peptide aggregates.",

    "title": "CSF protein biomarkers predicting longitudinal reduction of CSF beta-amyloid42 in cognitively healthy elders.",
    "abstract": "beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque accumulation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is believed to start many years prior to symptoms and is reflected by reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the peptide Abeta1-42 (Abeta42). Here we tested the hypothesis that baseline levels of CSF proteins involved in microglia activity, synaptic function and Abeta metabolism predict the development of Abeta plaques, assessed by longitudinal CSF Abeta42 decrease in cognitively healthy people. Forty-six healthy people with three to four serial CSF samples were included (mean follow-up 3 years, range 2-4 years). There was an overall reduction in Abeta42 from a mean concentration of 211-195 pg ml(-1) after 4 years. Linear mixed-effects models using longitudinal Abeta42 as the response variable, and baseline proteins as explanatory variables (n=69 proteins potentially relevant for Abeta metabolism, microglia or synaptic/neuronal function), identified 10 proteins with significant effects on longitudinal Abeta42. The most significant proteins were angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, P=0.009), Chromogranin A (CgA, P=0.009) and Axl receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL, P=0.009). Receiver-operating characteristic analysis identified 11 proteins with significant effects on longitudinal Abeta42 (largely overlapping with the proteins identified by linear mixed-effects models). Several proteins (including ACE, CgA and AXL) were associated with Abeta42 reduction only in subjects with normal baseline Abeta42, and not in subjects with reduced baseline Abeta42. We conclude that baseline CSF proteins related to Abeta metabolism, microglia activity or synapses predict longitudinal Abeta42 reduction in cognitively healthy elders. The finding that some proteins only predict Abeta42 reduction in subjects with normal baseline Abeta42 suggest that they predict future development of the brain Abeta pathology at the earliest stages of AD, prior to widespread development of Abeta plaques.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to estimate the relative contributions of degradation and brain-to-blood elimination processes to the clearance of microinjected human amyloid-beta peptide(1-40) (hAbeta(1-40)) from mouse cerebral cortex, using a solid-phase extraction method together with a newly developed ultraperformance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS) quantitation method for intact hAbeta(1-40). The clearance rate constant of hAbeta(1-40) in mouse cerebral cortex was determined to be 3.21 x 10(-2)/min under conditions where the saturable brain-to-blood elimination process across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was expected to be saturated. Thus, this clearance rate constant should mainly reflect degradation. The [(125)I]hAbeta(1-40) elimination rate across the BBB under nonsaturating conditions was determined to be 1.48 x 10(-2)/min. Inhibition studies suggested that processes sensitive to insulin and phosphoramidon, which inhibit neprilysin, insulin-degrading enzyme, and endothelin-converting enzyme, are involved not only in degradation, but also in elimination of hAbeta(1-40). In conclusion, our results suggest a dominant contribution of degradation to cerebral hAbeta(1-40) clearance, and also indicate that a sequential process of degradation and elimination of degradation products is involved in cerebral hAbeta(1-40) clearance.",

    "title": "Surface adsorption considerations when working with amyloid fibrils in multiwell plates and Eppendorf tubes.",
    "abstract": "The accumulation of cross-beta-sheet amyloid fibrils is the hallmark of amyloid diseases. Recently, we reported the discovery of amyloid disaggregase activities in extracts from mammalian cells and Caenorhabditis elegans. However, we have discovered a problem with the interpretation of our previous results as Abeta disaggregation in vitro. Here, we show that Abeta fibrils adsorb to the plastic surface of multiwell plates and Eppendorf tubes. This adsorption is markedly increased in the presence of complex biological mixtures subjected to a denaturing air-water interface. The time-dependent loss of thioflavin T fluorescence that we interpreted previously as disaggregation is due to increased adsorption of Abeta amyloid to the surfaces of multiwell plates and Eppendorf tubes in the presence of biological extracts. As the proteins in biological extracts denature over time at the air-water interface due to agitation/shaking, their adsorption increases, in turn promoting adsorption of amyloid fibrils. We delineate important control experiments that quantify the extent of amyloid adsorption to the surface of plastic and quartz containers. Based on the results described in this article, we conclude that our interpretation of the kinetic fibril disaggregation assay data previously reported in Bieschke et al., Protein Sci 2009;18:2231-2241 and Murray et al., Protein Sci 2010;19:836-846 is invalid when used as evidence for a disaggregase activity. Thus, we correct the two prior publications reporting that worm or mammalian cell extracts disaggregate Abeta amyloid fibrils in vitro at 37 C (see Corrigenda in this issue of Protein Science). We apologize for misinterpreting our previous data and for any confounding experimental efforts this may have caused.",

In view of the need for early AD diagnosis, brain Casp6 activity was investigated by measuring Tau cleaved by Casp6 (TauDeltaCasp6) protein in postmortem cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 7 non-cognitively impaired; 5 mild cognitively impaired; and 12 mild, moderate, and severe AD patients. Levels of TauDeltaCasp6 in CSF accurately reflected the levels of active Casp6 and TauDeltaCasp6 detected using immunohistochemistry in hippocampal sections from the same individuals. Levels of CSF TauDeltaCasp6 significantly correlated with AD severity and with lower Global Cognitive Scores; Mini-Mental State Examination scores; and episodic, semantic, and working memory scores. Regression analyses suggested that the CSF TauDeltaCasp6 levels combined with TauDeltaCasp6 brain pathology predict cognitive performance. These results indicate that CSF TauDeltaCasp6 levels hold promise as a novel early biomarker of AD.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a ubiquitously expressed single-pass transmembrane protein that undergoes proteolytic processing by secretases to generate the pathogenic amyloid-beta peptide, the major component in Alzheimer plaques. The traffic of APP through the cell determines its exposure to secretases and consequently the cleavages that generate the pathogenic or nonpathogenic peptide fragments. Despite the likely importance of APP traffic to Alzheimer disease, we still lack clear models for the routing and regulation of APP in cells. Like the traffic of most transmembrane proteins, the binding of adaptors to its cytoplasmic tail, which is 47 residues long and contains at least four distinct sorting motifs, regulates that of APP. We tested each of these for effects on the traffic of APP from the Golgi by mutating key residues within them and examining adaptor recruitment at the Golgi and traffic to post-Golgi site(s). We demonstrate strict specificity for recruitment of the Mint3 adaptor by APP at the Golgi, a critical role for Tyr-682 (within the YENPTY motif) in Mint3 recruitment and export of APP from the Golgi, and we identify LAMP1(+) structures as the proximal destination of APP after leaving the Golgi. Together, these data provide a detailed view of the first sorting step in its route to the cell surface and processing by secretases and further highlight the critical role played by Mint3.",

We find that a highly asymmetric cholesterol distribution that is depleted on the exofacial leaflet but enhanced on the cytofacial leaflet of the model lipid membrane thermodynamically favors membrane retention of a fully embedded Abeta peptide. However, in the case of cholesterol redistribution that increases concentration of cholesterol on the exofacial layer, typical of aging or Alzheimer's disease, the free energy favors peptide extrusion of the highly reactive N-terminus into the extracellular space that may be vulnerable to aggregation, oligomerization, or deleterious oxidative reactivity.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is central to the development of brain pathology in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. Association with receptors for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) enables the transport of Abeta peptide from circulating blood to human brain, and also causes the activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Here we show that two beta-strands of RAGE participate in the interaction with Abeta peptide. Serial deletion analysis of the RAGE V domain indicates that the third and eighth beta-strands are required for interaction with Abeta peptide. Site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids located in the third and eighth beta-strands abolish the interaction of RAGE with Abeta peptide. Wild-type RAGE activates the NF-kappaB signaling pathway in response to Abeta peptide treatment, while a RAGE mutant defective in Abeta binding does not. Furthermore, use of peptide for the third beta-strand or a RAGE monoclonal antibody that targets the RAGE-Abeta interaction interface inhibited transport of the Abeta peptide across the blood brain barrier in a mice model. These results provide information crucial to the development of RAGE-derived therapeutic reagents for Alzheimer disease.",

    "title": "On the subject of rigor in the study of amyloid beta-protein assembly.",
    "abstract": "According to Thomas Kuhn, the success of 'normal science,' the science we all practice on a daily basis, depends on the adherence to, and practice of, a paradigm accepted by the scientific community. When great scientific upheavals occur, they involve the rejection of the current paradigm in favor of a new paradigm that better integrates the facts available and better predicts the behavior of a particular scientific system. In the field of Alzheimer's disease, a recent example of such a paradigm shift has been the apparent rejection of the 'amyloid cascade hypothesis,' promulgated by Hardy and Higgins in 1992 to explain the etiology of Alzheimer's disease, in favor of what has been referred to as the 'oligomer cascade hypothesis'. This paradigm shift has been breathtaking in its rapidity, its pervasiveness in the Alzheimer's disease field, and its adoption in an increasing number of other fields, including those of Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the prionoses. However, these facts do not mean, a priori, that the experiments extant, and any re-interpretation of them, should be accepted by rote as support for the new paradigm. In the discussion that follows, I consider the foundational studies leading to the oligomer cascade hypothesis and evaluate the current state of the paradigm. I argue here that, more often than not, insufficient rigor has been applied in studies upon which this new paradigm has been based. Confusion, rather than clarity, has resulted. If the field is to make progress forward using as its paradigmatic basis amyloid beta-protein oligomerization, then an epistemological re-evaluation of the amyloid beta-protein oligomer system is required.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) and extensive neuronal cell death. Apoptosis plays a crucial role in loss of neurons in AD. Neuregulin1 (NRG1) has been found to protect neurons from oxygen glucose deprivation induced apoptosis and hypoxia ischemia induced apoptosis. However, the relationship between NRG1 and apoptosis related protein expression in AD and its mechanism remain uncertain. The present study explores the effects of NRG1 on Abeta-induced apoptosis in AD. In this study, extracellular domain of NRG1beta1 (NRG1beta1-ECD) promoted the expression of p-ErbB4 receptor, p-Akt and increased the level of Bcl-2 both in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and in vitro. In primary culture of neurons, the level of Bcl-2 protein decreased significantly after Abeta treatment. These changes were inhibited by pretreatment of neurons with NRG1beta1-ECD. A specific inhibitor of PI3-kinase/Akt pathway, wortmannin, significantly abrogated the effects of NRG1beta1-ECD on p-Akt and Bcl-2 levels. Furthermore, the expression of PI3-kinase/Akt by NRG1beta1-ECD was ErbB4-dependent. Our data demonstrated that NRG1beta1-ECD might serve as an obvious neuroprotection in AD, and the possible protective mechanism occurs most likely via ErbB4-dependent activation of PI3-kinase/Akt pathway.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common of the protein misfolding (\"amyloid\") diseases. The deposits in the brains of afflicted patients contain as a major fraction an aggregated insoluble form of the so-called amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta peptides): fragments of the amyloid precursor protein of 39-43 residues in length. This review focuses on biophysical studies of the Abeta peptides: that is, of the aggregation pathways and intermediates observed during aggregation, of the molecular structures observed along these pathways, and of the interactions of Abeta with Cu and Zn ions and with small molecules that modify the aggregation pathways. Particular emphasis is placed on studies based on high-resolution and solid-state NMR methods. Theoretical studies relating to the interactions are also included. An emerging picture is that of Abeta peptides in aqueous solution undergoing hydrophobic collapse together with identical partners. There then follows a relatively slow process leading to more ordered secondary and tertiary (quaternary) structures in the growing aggregates. These aggregates eventually assemble into elongated fibrils visible by electron microscopy. Small molecules or metal ions that interfere with the aggregation processes give rise to a variety of aggregation products that may be studied in vitro and considered in relation to observations in cell cultures or in vivo. Although the heterogeneous nature of the processes makes detailed structural studies difficult, knowledge and understanding of the underlying physical chemistry might provide a basis for future therapeutic strategies against the disease. A final part of the review deals with the interactions that may occur between the Abeta peptides and the prion protein, where the latter is involved in other protein misfolding diseases.",

    "abstract": "The synaptic toxicity of soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we report that overexpressed alpha1-takusan, which we previously identified as a protein that enhances synaptic activity via interaction with PSD-95, mitigates oligomeric Abeta-induced synaptic loss. In contrast, takusan knockdown results in enhanced synaptic damage. alpha1-Takusan interacts with tau either directly or indirectly, and prevents Abeta-induced tau hyperphosphorylation and mitochondrial fragmentation. Deletion analysis identified the second domain (D2) within the takusan protein that is required for PSD-95 clustering and synaptic protection from Abeta. A 51 aa sequence linking D2 to the PDZ-binding C terminus was found to be as effective as full-length takusan in protecting synapses from Abeta-induced damage. Moreover, a sequence containing the D2 from the human protein discs large homolog 5, when linked to a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif, can also increase the clustering of PSD-95 in cortical dendrites. In summary, alpha1-takusan protects synapses from Abeta-induced insult via interaction with PSD-95 and tau. Thus, takusan-based protein sequences from either mouse or human may be of potential therapeutic benefit in AD.",

    "title": "Molecular mechanism for age-related memory loss: the histone-binding protein RbAp48.",
    "abstract": "To distinguish age-related memory loss more explicitly from Alzheimer's disease (AD), we have explored its molecular underpinning in the dentate gyrus (DG), a subregion of the hippocampal formation thought to be targeted by aging. We carried out a gene expression study in human postmortem tissue harvested from both DG and entorhinal cortex (EC), a neighboring subregion unaffected by aging and known to be the site of onset of AD. Using expression in the EC for normalization, we identified 17 genes that manifested reliable age-related changes in the DG. The most significant change was an age-related decline in RbAp48, a histone-binding protein that modifies histone acetylation. To test whether the RbAp48 decline could be responsible for age-related memory loss, we turned to mice and found that, consistent with humans, RbAp48 was less abundant in the DG of old than in young mice. We next generated a transgenic mouse that expressed a dominant-negative inhibitor of RbAp48 in the adult forebrain. Inhibition of RbAp48 in young mice caused hippocampus-dependent memory deficits similar to those associated with aging, as measured by novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies showed that within the hippocampal formation, dysfunction was selectively observed in the DG, and this corresponded to a regionally selective decrease in histone acetylation. Up-regulation of RbAp48 in the DG of aged wild-type mice ameliorated age-related hippocampus-based memory loss and age-related abnormalities in histone acetylation. Together, these findings show that the DG is a hippocampal subregion targeted by aging, and identify molecular mechanisms of cognitive aging that could serve as valid targets for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To improve the understanding of the epidemiology of renal cortical neoplasms through pretreatment biopsy, we evaluated a facilitated ultrasound targeting (FUT) technology. The technology allows a needle to be passed through the transducer probe and guided along a virtual dotted line on the monitor. We compared the FUT with standard percutaneous biopsy (PB) technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight participants with various levels of training were recruited. Participants performed ultrasound-guided biopsies on phantom models using FUT and the standard biopsy technique in a randomized sequence. The phantom models consisted of pimento olives embedded in an opaque mold of Metamucil and Knox gelatin. Patients were given up to 10 attempts to achieve 3 complete specimens from the olives. Patients rated each biopsy technique. Results were stratified by level of experience. RESULTS: The mean time to obtain 3 complete biopsy specimens was significantly faster for FUT compared with the standard technique (140 seconds vs 246 seconds, P = .0001). The mean number of attempts needed to obtain 3 specimens was significantly less with FUT compared with the standard technique (4.3 vs 5.6 attempts, P = .0007). Patients reported that FUT was significantly easier to use compared with the standard technique (P = .0005). No significant order effect was observed. CONCLUSION: In this in vitro comparison, FUT increased the efficiency and efficacy of PB for users of all experience levels. FUT may allow urologists with limited PB experience to perform the procedure reliably and easily. Clinical evaluation of this technology is actively in progress.",

    "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) normally bars peripheral T lymphocytes from entering the cerebrum. Interestingly, activated T cells exist as infiltrates in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, but little is known about the mechanisms involved. In this study, we observed significantly higher MHC class I expression in rat brain endothelial cells compared with controls following the induction of experimental AD models. An in vitro BBB model, which was constructed with human brain microvascular endothelial cells, was established to study the mechanisms underlying the transendothelial migration of T cells. Using in vitro studies, we demonstrated that secretion of TNF-alpha from Abeta1-42-treated BV2 microglia contributes to the elevated expression of MHC class I on the brain microvessel endothelium. Transmigration assays and adhesion assays confirmed that the upregulation of MHC class I molecules was associated with T cell transendothelial migration. MHC class I knock-down in HBMECs significantly attenuated the migratory and adhesive capability of the T cells. Interestingly, a TNF-alpha neutralizing antibody effectively blocked the transendothelial migration of T cells triggered by treatment with the supernatant from Abeta1-42-treated BV2 microglia. We propose that microglia-derived TNF-alpha upregulates MHC class I molecule expression on brain endothelial cells, which represents a mechanism of T cell migration into the brain. This study may provide a new insight into the potential pathomechanism of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "The primary constituents of plaques (Abeta42/Abeta40) and neurofibrillary tangles (tau and phosphorylated forms of tau [ptau]) are the current leading diagnostic and prognostic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for AD. In this study, we performed deep sequencing of APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, GRN, APOE and MAPT genes in individuals with extreme CSF Abeta42, tau, or ptau levels. One known pathogenic mutation (PSEN1 p.A426P), four high-risk variants for AD (APOE p.L46P, MAPT p.A152T, PSEN2 p.R62H and p.R71W) and nine novel variants were identified. Surprisingly, a coding variant in PSEN1, p.E318G (rs17125721-G) exhibited a significant association with high CSF tau (p = 9.2 x 10(-4)) and ptau (p = 1.8 x 10(-3)) levels. The association of the p.E318G variant with Abeta deposition was observed in APOE-epsilon4 allele carriers. Furthermore, we found that in a large case-control series (n = 5,161) individuals who are APOE-epsilon4 carriers and carry the p.E318G variant are at a risk of developing AD (OR = 10.7, 95% CI = 4.7-24.6) that is similar to APOE-epsilon4 homozygous (OR = 9.9, 95% CI = 7.2.9-13.6), and double the risk for APOE-epsilon4 carriers that do not carry p.E318G (OR = 3.9, 95% CI = 3.4-4.4). The p.E318G variant is present in 5.3% (n = 30) of the families from a large clinical series of LOAD families (n = 565) and exhibited a higher frequency in familial LOAD (MAF = 2.5%) than in sporadic LOAD (MAF = 1.6%) (p = 0.02). Additionally, we found that in the presence of at least one APOE-epsilon4 allele, p.E318G is associated with more Abeta plaques and faster cognitive decline. We demonstrate that the effect of PSEN1, p.E318G on AD susceptibility is largely dependent on an interaction with APOE-epsilon4 and mediated by an increased burden of Abeta deposition.",

It has been suggested that inflammatory changes are associated with disease; however, it has not been established whether these are a consequence of ongoing neurodegeneration or whether inflammation itself contributes to disease pathogenesis. Recent studies suggest that exposure to infection can accelerate cognitive decline in AD patients, and pathogens have been detected in the AD brain. However, the influence of infection on neuroinflammation and pathology remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the effect of a peripheral infection on AD pathology in APP/PS1 mice. We found that, 8 weeks after infection with the Gram negative respiratory pathogen Bordetella pertussis, there was significant infiltration of IFNgamma- and IL-17-producing T cells and NKT cells in older APP/PS1 mice. This was accompanied by increased glial activation and amyloid-beta deposition. The data suggest that infection is a critical factor in the progression of AD, emphasising the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of infections in elderly individuals.",

Although senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are well-established hallmarks of AD, changes in cerebral white matter correlate with cognitive decline and may increase the risk of the development of dementia. We used the triple transgenic (3xTg)-AD mouse model of AD, previously used to show that white matter changes precede plaque formation, to test the hypothesis that MRI detectable changes occur in the corpus callosum, external capsule and the fornix. T2-weighted and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging and histological stains were employed to assess white matter in older (11-17months) 3xTg-AD mice and controls. We found no statistically significant changes in white matter between 3xTg-AD mice and controls, despite well-developed neurofibrillary tangles and beta amyloid immunoreactive plaques. Myelin staining was normal in affected mice. These data suggest that the 3xTg-AD mouse model does not develop MRI detectable white matter changes at the ages we examined.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein and tau deposition in the brain. Numerous studies have reported a central role of Abeta in the development of AD, but the pathogenesis is not well understood. Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), an intracellular protein mediating a repulsive axon guidance molecule, Semaphorin3A, is also accumulated in neurofibrillary tangles in AD brains. To gain insight into the role of CRMP2 phosphorylation in AD pathogenesis, we investigated the effects of Abeta neurotoxicity in CRMP2 phosphorylation-deficient knock-in (crmp2(ki/ki)) mice, in which the serine residue at 522 was replaced with alanine. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of Abeta25-35 peptide, a neurotoxic fragment of Abeta protein, to wild-type (wt) mice increased hippocampal phosphorylation of CRMP2. Behavioral assessment revealed that i.c.v. injection of Abeta25-35 peptide caused impairment of novel object recognition in wt mice, while the same peptide did not in crmp2(ki/ki) mice. In electrophysiological recording, wt and crmp2(ki/ki) mice have similar input-output basal synaptic transmission and paired-pulse ratios. However, long-term potentiation was impaired in hippocampal slices of Abeta25-35 peptide-treated wt but not those of crmp2(ki/ki). Our findings indicate that CRMP2 phosphorylation is required for Abeta-induced impairment of cognitive memory and synaptic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Neurovascular dysfunction arising from endothelial cell damage is an early pathogenic event that contributes to the neurodegenerative process occurring in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since the mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction are not fully elucidated, this study was aimed to explore the hypothesis that brain endothelial cell death is induced upon the sustained activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response by amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, which deposits in the cerebral vessels in many AD patients and transgenic mice. Incubation of rat brain endothelial cells (RBE4 cell line) with Abeta1-40 increased the levels of several markers of ER stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR), in a time-dependent manner, and affected the Ca(2+) homeostasis due to the release of Ca(2+) from this intracellular store. Finally, Abeta1-40 was shown to activate both mitochondria-dependent and -independent apoptotic cell death pathways. Enhanced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and activation of the downstream caspase-9 were observed in cells treated with Abeta1-40 concomitantly with caspase-12 activation. Furthermore, Abeta1-40 activated the apoptosis effectors' caspase-3 and promoted the translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) to the nucleus demonstrating the involvement of caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms during Abeta-induced endothelial cell death. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that ER stress plays a significant role in Abeta1-40-induced apoptotic cell death in brain endothelial cells suggesting that ER stress-targeted therapeutic strategies might be useful in AD to counteract vascular defects and ultimately neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Rattin, a specific derivative of humanin in rats, shares the ability with HN to protect neurons against amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide-induced cellular toxicity. However, it is still unclear whether Rattin can protect against Abeta-induced deficits in cognition and synaptic plasticity in rats. In the present study, we observed the effects of Rattin and Abeta31-35 on the spatial reference memory and in vivo hippocampal Long-term potentiation of rats by using Morris water maze test and hippocampal field potential recording. Furthermore, the probable molecular mechanism underlying the neuroprotective roles of Rattin was investigated. We showed that intra-hippocampal injection of Rattin effectively prevented the Abeta31-35-induced spatial memory deficits and hippocampal LTP suppression in rats; the Abeta31-35-induced activation of Caspase-3 and inhibition of STAT3 in the hippocampus were also prevented by Rattin treatment. These findings indicate that Rattin treatment can protect spatial memory and synaptic plasticity of rats against Abeta31-35-induced impairments, and the underlying protective mechanism of Rattin may be involved in STAT3 and Caspases-3 pathways. Therefore, application of Rattin or activation of its signaling pathways in the brain might be beneficial to the prevention of Abeta-related cognitive deficits.",

Recently, the molecular aggregates constituting the early stage of fibril formation, i.e., oligomers and protofibrils, have been investigated as the main responsible for amyloid-beta cytotoxic effect. The molecular mechanism leading to neurodegeneration is still under debate, and it is common opinion that it may reside in the interaction between amyloid species and the neural membrane. In this investigation Atomic Force Microscopy and spectroscopy have been used to understand how structural (and mechanical) properties of POPC/POPS lipid bilayers, simulating the phospholipid composition and negative net charge of neuritic cell membranes, are influenced by the interaction with Abeta(1-40), in different stages of the peptide aggregation. Substantial differences in the damage caused to the lipid bilayers have been observed, confirming the toxic effect exerted especially by Abeta(1-40) prefibrillar oligomers.",

Injecting the two extracts into the APPPS1 host revealed a similar difference between the induced beta-amyloid deposits, although less prominent, and the induced deposits were similar to the beta-amyloid deposits found in aged APPPS1 hosts. These results indicate that the molecular composition and conformation of aggregated Abeta in APP transgenic mice can be maintained by seeded conversion.",

    "title": "Membrane-mediated neuroprotection by curcumin from amyloid-beta-peptide-induced toxicity.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta)-membrane interactions have been implicated in the formation of toxic oligomers that permeabilize membranes, allowing an influx of calcium ions and triggering cell death in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Curcumin, a small dietary polyphenolic molecule, has been shown to reduce Abeta-induced toxicity and AD pathology. We investigate here the effect of curcumin on Abeta40-induced toxicity in cultured human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and test a novel neuroprotection mechanism in which curcumin reduces Abeta-membrane interactions and attenuates Abeta-induced membrane disruptions. Predominantly monomeric Abeta40 exerts toxicity toward SH-SY5Y cells and has been shown to insert spontaneously into anionic lipid monolayers at the air/water interface, resulting in the misfolding and assembly of Abeta into beta-sheet-enriched oligomers. Concomitantly, membrane morphology and lipid packing are disrupted. Curcumin dose-dependently ameliorates Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and reduces either the rate or extent of Abeta insertion into anionic lipid monolayers. Moreover, curcumin reduces Abeta-induced dye leakage from lipid-bilayer-covered, dye-loaded, porous silica microspheres. Because curcumin neither affects the inherent surface activity of Abeta nor modifies the membrane properties, it reduces Abeta insertion by directly attenuating Abeta-membrane interactions and reducing Abeta-induced membrane disruption. Although the exact molecular mechanism of curcumin's membrane protective effect remains unclear, this effect could in part contribute to curcumin's neuroprotective effect with respect to Abeta-induced toxicity. Our work reveals a novel molecular mechanism by which curcumin reduces Abeta-related pathology and toxicity and suggests a therapeutic strategy for preventing or treating AD by targeting the inhibition of Abeta-induced membrane disruption.",

In this study the anti-beta-amyloid capacity of PPI glycodendrimers of the fourth and fifth generations was investigated in vitro and in vivo. We assessed distinct PPI glycodendrimers including G4mDS and G5mDS, with electroneutral maltose shell, and G4mOS and G4m-IIIOS, with cationic maltose or maltotriose shell. Our results show that in vitro PPI maltose dendrimers reduce the toxicity of Abeta(1-42). However, only the electroneutral maltose dendrimers G4mDS and G5mDS reduce the toxicity of Alzheimer's disease brain extracts in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. PPI maltose dendrimers with electroneutral or cationic surface penetrate the cytoplasm of cultured cells, and they reach the brain when administered intranasally. Both cationic G4mOS and electroneutral G4mDS are able to modify the total burden of beta-amyloid in APP/PS1 mice. The studied dendrimers did not reverse memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice following chronic administration; moreover, cationic G4mOS caused cognitive decline in nontransgenic mice. In spite of the capacity of G4mDS and G4mOS to cross the blood-brain barrier and modulate Abeta aggregation in APP/PS1 mice, further studies are needed to learn how to reduce the harmful effects of maltose dendrimers in vivo.",

    "abstract": "For several decades scientists have speculated that the key to understanding age-related neurodegenerative disorders may be found in the unusual biology of the prion diseases. Recently, owing largely to the advent of new disease models, this hypothesis has gained experimental momentum. In a remarkable variety of diseases, specific proteins have been found to misfold and aggregate into seeds that structurally corrupt like proteins, causing them to aggregate and form pathogenic assemblies ranging from small oligomers to large masses of amyloid. Proteinaceous seeds can therefore serve as self-propagating agents for the instigation and progression of disease. Alzheimer's disease and other cerebral proteopathies seem to arise from the de novo misfolding and sustained corruption of endogenous proteins, whereas prion diseases can also be infectious in origin. However, the outcome in all cases is the functional compromise of the nervous system, because the aggregated proteins gain a toxic function and/or lose their normal function. As a unifying pathogenic principle, the prion paradigm suggests broadly relevant therapeutic directions for a large class of currently intractable diseases.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of senile dementia in the United States. Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and the effects of this peptide on microglial cells contribute greatly to the etiology of AD. Experiments were carried out to determine whether the pan-selective sigma-receptor agonist afobazole can modulate microglial response to the cytotoxic Abeta fragment, Abeta25-35. Treatment with afobazole decreased microglial activation in response to Abeta, as indicated by reduced membrane ruffling and cell migration. The effects of afobazole on Abeta25-35-evoked migration were concentration dependent and consistent with sigma-receptor activation. When afobazole was coapplied with either BD-1047 [N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-N-methyl-2-(dimethylamino)ethylamine dihydrobromide] or rimcazole, which are sigma-1- and sigma-2-selective antagonists, respectively, the inhibition of Abeta25-35-induced migration by afobazole was reduced. Prolonged exposure of microglia to Abeta25-35 resulted in glial cell death that was associated with increased expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax and the death protease caspase-3. Coapplication of afobazole with Abeta25-35 decreased the number of cells expressing both Bax and caspase-3 and resulted in a concomitant enhancement in cell survival. Although afobazole inhibited activation of microglia cells by Abeta25-35, it preserved normal functional responses in these cells after exposure to the amyloid peptide. Intracellular calcium increases induced by ATP were depressed in microglia after 24-hour exposure to Abeta25-35. However, coincubation in afobazole returned these responses to near control levels. Therefore, stimulation of sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors by afobazole prevents Abeta25-35 activation of microglia and inhibits Abeta25-35-associated cytotoxicity, suggesting that afobazole may be useful for AD therapeutics.",

The hypothesis of this investigation was that CSF Abeta(42) levels would correlate with regulatory region variation in genes that are biologically associated with degradation or clearance of Abeta from the brain. CSF Abeta(42) levels were tested for associations with Abeta degradation and clearance genes and APOE epsilon4. Twenty-four SNPs located within the 5' and 3' regions of 12 genes were analyzed. The study sample consisted of 99 AD patients and 168 cognitively normal control subjects. CSF Abeta(42) levels were associated with APOE epsilon4 status in controls but not in AD patients; A2M regulatory region SNPs were also associated with CSF Abeta(42) levels in controls but not in AD patients, even after adjusting for APOE epsilon4.

Furthermore, we show that beclin 1-mediated impairments in phagocytosis are associated with dysfunctional recruitment of retromer to phagosomal membranes, reduced retromer levels, and impaired recycling of phagocytic receptors CD36 and Trem2. Interestingly, microglia isolated from human Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains show significantly reduced beclin 1 and retromer protein levels. These findings position beclin 1 as a link between autophagy, retromer trafficking, and receptor-mediated phagocytosis and provide insight into mechanisms by which phagocytosis is regulated and how it may become impaired in AD.",

At the postsynaptic density (PSD), extracellular Abetao bound to lipid-anchored PrP(C) activates intracellular Fyn kinase to disrupt synapses. Here, we screened transmembrane PSD proteins heterologously for the ability to couple Abetao-PrP(C) with Fyn. Only coexpression of the metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5, allowed PrP(C)-bound Abetao to activate Fyn. PrP(C) and mGluR5 interact physically, and cytoplasmic Fyn forms a complex with mGluR5. Abetao-PrP(C) generates mGluR5-mediated increases of intracellular calcium in Xenopus oocytes and in neurons, and the latter is also driven by human AD brain extracts. In addition, signaling by Abetao-PrP(C)-mGluR5 complexes mediates eEF2 phosphorylation and dendritic spine loss. For mice expressing familial AD transgenes, mGluR5 antagonism reverses deficits in learning, memory, and synapse density. Thus, Abetao-PrP(C) complexes at the neuronal surface activate mGluR5 to disrupt neuronal function.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: New research criteria for preclinical Alzheimer's disease have been proposed, which include stages for cognitively normal individuals with abnormal amyloid markers (stage 1), abnormal amyloid and neuronal injury markers (stage 2), or abnormal amyloid and neuronal injury markers and subtle cognitive changes (stage 3). We aimed to investigate the prevalence and long-term outcome of preclinical Alzheimer's disease according to these criteria. METHODS: Participants were cognitively normal (clinical dementia rating [CDR]=0) community-dwelling volunteers aged at least 65 years who were enrolled between 1998 and 2011 at the Washington University School of Medicine (MO, USA). CSF amyloid-beta1-42 and tau concentrations and a memory composite score were used to classify participants as normal (both markers normal), preclinical Alzheimer's disease stage 1-3, or suspected non-Alzheimer pathophysiology (SNAP, abnormal injury marker without abnormal amyloid marker). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants in each preclinical AD stage. Secondary outcomes included progression to CDR at least 0 5, symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (score of at least 0 5 for memory and at least one other domain and cognitive impairments deemed to be due to Alzheimer's disease), and mortality. We undertook survival analyses using subdistribution and standard Cox hazards models and linear mixed models. FINDINGS: Of 311 participants, 129 (41%) were classed as normal, 47 (15%) as stage 1, 36 (12%) as stage 2, 13 (4%) as stage 3, 72 (23%) as SNAP, and 14 (5%) remained unclassified. The 5-year progression rate to CDR at least 0 5, symptomatic Alzheimer's disease was 2% for participants classed as normal, 11% for stage 1, 26% for stage 2, 56% for stage 3, and 5% for SNAP. Compared with individuals classed as normal, participants with preclinical Alzheimer's disease had an increased risk of death after adjusting for covariates (hazard ratio 6 2, 95% CI 1 1-35 0; p=0 040). INTERPRETATION: Preclinical Alzheimer's disease is common in cognitively normal elderly people and is associated with future cognitive decline and mortality. Thus, preclinical Alzheimer's disease could be an important target for therapeutic intervention.

Among these, Abeta oligomers are implicated as the primary toxic species as pointed by multiple lines of evidence. It has been suggested that toxicity could be rendered by the soluble higher-molecular-weight (high-n) Abeta oligomers. Yet, the most culpable form in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains elusive. Moreover, the potential interaction among the insoluble fibrils that have been excluded from the responsible aggregates in AD development, Abeta monomers and high-n oligomers is undetermined. Here, we report that insoluble Abeta fibrillar seeds can interact with Abeta monomers at the stoichiometry of 1:2 (namely, each Abeta molecule of seed can bind to two Abeta monomers at a time) facilitating the fibrillization by omitting the otherwise mandatory formation of the toxic high-n oligomers during the fibril maturation. As a result, the addition of exogenous Abeta fibrillar seeds is seen to rescue neuronal cells from Abeta cytotoxicity presumably exerted by high-n oligomers, suggesting an unexpected protective role of Abeta fibrillar seeds.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder whose pathogenesis involves production and aggregation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). Abeta-induced toxicity is believed to involve alterations on as Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities, prior to neuronal death. Drugs able to prevent or to reverse these biochemical changes promote neuroprotection. GM1 is a ganglioside proposed to have neuroprotective roles in AD models, through mechanisms not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of Abeta1-42 infusion and GM1 treatment on recognition memory and on Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and AChE activities, as well as, on antioxidant defense in the brain cortex and the hippocampus. For these purposes, Wistar rats received i.c.v. infusion of fibrilar Abeta1-42 (2 nmol) and/or GM1 (0.30 mg/kg). Behavioral and biochemical analyses were conducted 1 month after the infusion procedures. Our results showed that GM1 treatment prevented Abeta-induced cognitive deficit, corroborating its neuroprotective function. Abeta impaired Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and increase AChE activities in hippocampus and cortex, respectively. GM1, in turn, has partially prevented Abeta-induced alteration on Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, though with no impact on AChE activity. Abeta caused a decrease in antioxidant defense, specifically in hippocampus, an effect that was prevented by GM1 treatment. GM1, both in cortex and hippocampus, was able to increase antioxidant scavenge capacity. Our results suggest that Abeta-triggered cognitive deficit involves region-specific alterations on Na(+),K(+)-ATPase and AChE activities, and that GM1 neuroprotection involves modulation of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase, maybe by its antioxidant properties. Although extrapolation from animal findings is difficult, it is conceivable that GM1 could play an important role in AD treatment.",

Abeta and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) elicited similar M cytokine and exosomal mRNA (ex-mRNA) responses. Abeta- and LPS-stimulated Ms from 20 >=65-yr-old subjects generated significantly more IL-1, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, but not IL-8 or IL-12, and significantly more ex-mRNAs for IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-12, but not for IL-8 or IL-1, than Ms from 20 matched 21- to 45-yr-old subjects. CD4-Tm generation of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-gamma and, for young subjects, IL-10, but not IL-6, evoked by Abeta was significantly lower than with anti-T-cell antigen receptor antibodies (Abs). Abs significantly increased all CD4-Tm ex-mRNAs, but only IL-2 and IL-6 ex-mRNAs were increased by Abeta. There were no significant differences between cytokine and ex-mRNA responses of CD4-Tms from the old compared to the young subjects. M-derived serum exosomes from the old subjects had significantly higher IL-6 and IL-12 ex-mRNA levels than those from the young subjects, whereas there were no differences for CD4-Tm-derived serum exosomes. An Abeta level relevant to neurodegeneration elicited broad M cytokine and ex-mRNA responses that were significantly greater in the old subjects, but only narrow and age-independent CD4-Tm responses.",

    "abstract": "The formation of amyloid, a cross-beta-sheet fibrillar aggregate of proteins, is associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Amyloidogenic proteins such as beta-amyloid (Abeta) are known to exist with a large amount of polyelectrolyte macromolecules in vivo. The exact nature of Abeta-polyelectrolyte interactions and their roles in Abeta-aggregation are largely unknown. In this regard, we report the inhibiting effect of an anionic polyelectrolyte poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) on the aggregation of Abeta40 peptide. The results demonstrate the strong inhibition potential of PSS on the aggregation of Abeta40 and imply the dominant role of hydrophobicity of the polyelectrolyte in reducing the propensity of Abeta40 amyloid formation. Additional studies with poly(vinyl sulfate) (PVS) and p-toluenesulfonate (PTS), which share similar charge density with PSS except the former lacking the nonpolar aromatic side chain and the latter the aliphatic hydrocarbon backbone, reveal that the presence of both aliphatic backbone and aromatic side chain group in PSS is essential for its Abeta-aggregation inhibition activity. The interactions involved in the Abeta40-PSS complex were further investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Our results provide new insights into the structural interplay between polyelectrolytes and Abeta peptide, facilitating the ultimate understanding of amyloid formation in Alzheimer's disease. The results should assist in developing novel polyelectrolytes as potential chemical tools to study amyloid aggregation.",

The DIAN-TU has launched a trial design that leverages the existing infrastructure of the ongoing DIAN observational study, takes advantage of a variety of drug targets, incorporates the latest results of biomarker and cognitive data collected during the observational study, and implements biomarkers measuring Alzheimer's disease (AD) biological processes to improve the efficiency of trial design. The DIAN-TU trial design is unique due to the sophisticated design of multiple drugs, multiple pharmaceutical partners, academics servings as sponsor, geographic distribution of a rare population and intensive safety and biomarker assessments.

    "abstract": "Development of extracellular plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease is related to aggregation of amyloid peptides. The Abeta-42 peptide is the most aggregation prone species, and some missense mutant forms increase this aggregation ability. Due to its poor solubility as monomer in aqueous solutions, Abeta-42 conformational transitions in water have been largely investigated by molecular dynamics. Here we report an all-atom molecular dynamics analysis of the Abeta-42 peptide in aqueous environment using as starting conformation a structure obtained in an isotropic, low-polarity medium, representing a plausible model for the membrane-bound species. While previous studies commonly show that Abeta-42 is largely unstructured in aqueous solution, here we report that this peptide can adopt partially folded structures. Importance of ionic strength has been also investigated, showing that at physiological ionic strength condition a loop stabilizing electrostatic interaction involving Lys28 builds up. In addition, besides stable alpha-helix structures, we observe the appearance of 310 helix, similar to what was reported experimentally for the Abeta-40 species. The effect of E22Q (Dutch) mutation in high ionic strength condition has been explored. We show that this mutation has a dramatic impact on the Abeta-42 structure. Instead of a partially folded, but extended, conformation obtained with the wild type, the E22Q assumes a two-helix collapsed one due to the clustering of hydrophobic residues.",

Here, we demonstrate that vaccination of APPswePSEN1dE9 mice with SDPM1, an engineered non-native Abeta amyloid-specific binding peptide, lowers brain Abeta amyloid plaque burden and brain Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 peptide levels, improves cognitive learning and memory in Morris water maze tests and increases the expression of synaptic brain proteins. This was the case in young mice immunized prior to development of significant brain amyloid burden, and in older mice, where brain amyloid was already present. Active immunization was optimized using ALUM as an adjuvant to stimulate production of anti-SDPM1 and anti-Abeta amyloid antibodies. Intracerebral injection of P4D6, an SDPM1 peptide-mimotope antibody, also lowered brain amyloid plaque burden in APPswePSEN1dE9 mice. Additionally, P4D6 inhibited Abeta amyloid-mediated toxicity in cultured neuronal cells. The protein sequence of the variable domain within the P4D6 heavy chain was found to mimic a multimer of the SDPM1 peptide motif. These data demonstrate the efficacy of active and passive vaccine strategies to target Abeta amyloid oligomers using an engineered peptide-mimotope strategy.",

However, no defined toxic structures acting via specific receptors have been identified and roles of proposed receptors, such as prion protein (PrP), remain controversial. Here we quantify binding to PrP of Abeta(1-42) after different durations of aggregation. We show PrP-binding and PrP-dependent inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) correlate with the presence of protofibrils. Globular oligomers bind less avidly to PrP and do not inhibit LTP, whereas fibrils inhibit LTP in a PrP-independent manner. That only certain transient Abeta assemblies cause PrP-dependent toxicity explains conflicting reports regarding the involvement of PrP in Abeta-induced impairments. We show that these protofibrils contain a defined nanotubular structure with a previously unidentified triple helical conformation. Blocking the formation of Abeta nanotubes or their interaction with PrP might have a role in treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

The universal presence of beta-amyloid and tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has facilitated advancement of the amyloid cascade and tau hypotheses that have dominated AD pathogenesis research and therapeutic development. However, the underlying etiology of the disease remains to be fully elucidated. Here we report a comprehensive study of the human brain-insoluble proteome in AD by mass spectrometry. We identify 4,216 proteins, among which 36 proteins accumulate in the disease, including U1-70K and other U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) spliceosome components. Similar accumulations in mild cognitive impairment cases indicate that spliceosome changes occur in early stages of AD. Multiple U1 snRNP subunits form cytoplasmic tangle-like structures in AD but not in other examined neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Comparison of RNA from AD and control brains reveals dysregulated RNA processing with accumulation of unspliced RNA species in AD, including myc box-dependent-interacting protein 1, clusterin, and presenilin-1. U1-70K knockdown or antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of U1 snRNP increases the protein level of amyloid precursor protein. Thus, our results demonstrate unique U1 snRNP pathology and implicate abnormal RNA splicing in AD pathogenesis.",

    "title": "Comparing atomistic molecular mechanics force fields for a difficult target: a case study on the Alzheimer's amyloid beta-peptide.",
    "abstract": "Macromolecular function arises from structure, and many diseases are associated with misfolding of proteins. Molecular simulation methods can augment experimental techniques to understand misfolding and aggregation pathways with atomistic resolution, but the reliability of these predictions is a function of the parameters used for the simulation. There are many biomolecular force fields available, but most are validated using stably folded structures. Here, we present the results of molecular dynamics simulations on the intrinsically disordered amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), whose misfolding and aggregation give rise to the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Because of the link between secondary structure changes and pathology, being able to accurately model the structure of Abeta would greatly improve our understanding of this disease, and it may facilitate application of modeling approaches to other protein misfolding disorders. To this end, we compared five popular atomistic force fields (AMBER03, CHARMM22 + CMAP, GROMOS96 53A6, GROMOS96 54A7, and OPLS-AA) to determine which could best model the structure of Abeta. By comparing secondary structure content, NMR shifts, and radius of gyration to available experimental data, we conclude that AMBER03 and CHARMM22 + CMAP over-stabilize helical structure within Abeta, with CHARMM22 + CMAP also producing elongated Abeta structures, in conflict with experimental findings. OPLS-AA, GROMOS96 53A6, and GROMOS96 54A7 produce very similar results in terms of helical and beta-strand content, calculated NMR shifts, and radii of gyration that agree well with experimental data.",

    "title": "Increased number of microinfarcts in Alzheimer disease at 7-T MR imaging.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence and number of cortical microinfarcts in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) by using a 7-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging system, to assess the independent association of cortical microinfarcts with cognitive dysfunction, and to investigate potential confounding effects of the coexisting presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The local institutional review board approved this study. In all cases, informed consent was obtained. High-spatial-resolution fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and T2*-weighted images were acquired in 14 AD patients and 18 control subjects to assess the presence of microinfarcts and microbleeds. Presence of CAA was assessed according to the Boston criteria. Image analysis was performed independently by two reviewers. Mann-Whitney U test was performed to assess differences in number of microinfarcts between groups. Negative binomial regression models were used to assess the association between diagnosis of AD and diagnosis of CAA and number of microinfarcts, between diagnosis of AD and number of microbleeds and number of microinfarcts, and between cognitive function and number of microinfarcts, all corrected for age and sex. RESULTS: Interobserver agreement was excellent for detecting microinfarcts (kappa = 0.91) (P < .001). Patients with AD demonstrated higher number (P = .005) of microinfarcts (mean, 7.2) compared with control subjects (mean, 1.8). Negative binomial regression models showed an independent association between AD and number of microinfarcts (P = .006) and a trend for CAA and microinfarcts (P = .052). A negative correlation was found between cognitive function and the number of microinfarcts (P = .009). CONCLUSION: Patients with AD show more microinfarcts than do control subjects, the number of microinfarcts correlates with global cognitive performance, and the presence of microinfarcts was mainly AD rather than CAA related.",

    "abstract": "Cannabinoid (CB) ligands have demonstrated neuroprotective properties. In this study we compared the effects of a diverse set of CB ligands against beta amyloid-mediated neuronal toxicity and activated microglial-conditioned media-based neurotoxicity in vitro, and compared this with a capacity to directly alter beta amyloid (Abeta) fibril or aggregate formation. Neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells were exposed to Abeta1-42 directly or microglial (BV-2 cells) conditioned media activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence of the CB1 receptor-selective agonist ACEA, CB2 receptor-selective agonist JWH-015, phytocannabinoids Delta(9)-THC and cannabidiol (CBD), the endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) and anandamide or putative GPR18/GPR55 ligands O-1602 and abnormal-cannabidiol (Abn-CBD). TNF-alpha and nitrite production was measured in BV-2 cells to compare activation via LPS or albumin with Abeta1-42. Abeta1-42 evoked a concentration-dependent loss of cell viability in SH-SY5Y cells but negligible TNF-alpha and nitrite production in BV-2 cells compared to albumin or LPS. Both albumin and LPS-activated BV-2 conditioned media significantly reduced neuronal cell viability but were directly innocuous to SH-SY5Y cells. Of those CB ligands tested, only 2-AG and CBD were directly protective against Abeta-evoked SH-SY5Y cell viability, whereas JWH-015, THC, CBD, Abn-CBD and O-1602 all protected SH-SY5Y cells from BV-2 conditioned media activated via LPS. While CB ligands variably altered the morphology of Abeta fibrils and aggregates, there was no clear correlation between effects on Abeta morphology and neuroprotective actions. These findings indicate a neuroprotective action of CB ligands via actions at microglial and neuronal cells.",

    "title": "Conformational features of tau fibrils from Alzheimer's disease brain are faithfully propagated by unmodified recombinant protein.",
    "abstract": "Fibrils composed of tau protein are a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show that when recombinant tau protein is seeded with paired helical filaments (PHFs) isolated from AD brain, the amyloid formed shares many of the structural features of AD PHFs. In contrast, tau amyloids formed with heparin as an inducing agent-a common biochemical model of tau misfolding-are structurally distinct from brain-derived PHFs. Using ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy, circular dichroism, and chemical denaturation, we found that AD seeded recombinant tau fibrils were not significantly different than tau fibrils isolated from AD brain tissue. Tau fibrils produced by incubating recombinant tau with heparin had significantly narrower fibrils with a longer periodicity, higher chemical stability, and distinct secondary structure compared to AD PHFs. The addition of heparin to the reaction of recombinant tau and AD PHFs also corrupted the templating process, resulting in a mixture of fibril conformations. Our results suggest that AD-isolated PHFs act as a conformational template for the formation of recombinant tau fibrils. Therefore, the use of AD PHFs as seeds to stimulate recombinant tau amyloid formation produces synthetic tau fibers that closely resemble those associated with AD pathology and provides a biochemical model of tau misfolding that may be of improved utility for structural studies and drug screening. These results also demonstrate that post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are not a prerequisite for the propagation of the tau fibril conformation found in AD.",

Experiments on tissue from two Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with distinct clinical histories showed a single predominant 40 residue Abeta (Abeta40) fibril structure in each patient; however, the structures were different from one another. A molecular structural model developed for Abeta40 fibrils from one patient reveals features that distinguish in-vivo- from in-vitro-produced fibrils.

    "abstract": "Aggregated beta-amyloid deposit is a hallmark in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease but their mechanism of formation still remains unresolved. Previously we reported that a normal pentapeptide Abeta(17-21) and glycine zipper peptide Abeta(29-33) strongly inhibited nitric oxide synthase and rapidly initiated fibrillogenesis. Critical amino acids within these fragments were not identified. We now report on the interaction of four pseudo-peptides with nNOS - two peptides with a reversed amino acid sequence [Abeta(17-21r); Abeta(29-33r)] and two peptides with Phe19, Phe20 and Ile31, Ile32 substituted with polar glutamic acid [Abeta(17-21p); Abeta(29-33p)]. It was shown that while the inhibitor constants (Ki) increased 2-3 fold for each of the pseudo-peptides when compared with the normal peptides the dissociation constant Kd increased between 20 and 50 fold. Stern-Volmer fluorescence quenching constants (K(SV)) for Abeta(17-21p) and Abeta(29-33p) were 7.2x10(-3) and 6.1x10(-3) muM(-1) respectively at 298 K some 2-3 fold lower than the corresponding Abeta(17-21r); Abeta(29-33r). With temperature increase there was an increase in K(SV) and Kd, suggesting a dynamic quenching mechanism. Thermodynamic parameters, DeltaH, DeltaS and DeltaG were all positive indicating endothermic, non-spontaneous, hydrophobic-hydrophobic associations of the pseudo-peptides with the enzyme. By FRET analysis the efficiency of fluorescence transfer between enzyme tryptophans and the pseudo-peptides was 90% (compared to 97% for the natural substrate). The distance the tryptophans moved after interaction with Abeta(17-21r) and Abeta(17-21p) was 10% greater, while for Abeta(29-33r) and Abeta(29-33p) it was 20-25% greater, than with the normal peptides; the fluorescence intensity was 20-75% higher. This increase in distance, fluorescent intensity and transfer efficiency illustrate an increase in interaction energy for the pseudo-peptides with nNOS lending support for the strategic position of the Phe19, Phe20, Ile31 and Ile32 in the original peptides not only for inhibition of the nNOS but for initiation of fibrillogenesis.",

To date, no treatments are available that can reverse or delay AD-related symptoms in patients. In the current study, we introduce a new Abeta toxicity inhibitor, SEN1500, which in addition to its block effect on Abeta1-42 toxicity in synaptophysin assays, can be administered orally and cross the blood-brain barrier without adverse effects in mice. In a different set of animals, APPPS1-21 mice were fed with three different doses of SEN1500 (1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) for a period of 5 months. Cognition was assessed in a variety of behavioral tests (Morris water maze, social recognition, conditioned taste aversion and passive avoidance). Results suggest a positive effect on cognition with 20 mg/kg SEN1500 compared to control APPPS1-21 mice. However, no changes in soluble or insoluble Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 were detected in the brains of SEN1500-fed mice. SEN1500 also attenuated the effect of Abeta1-42 on synaptophysin levels in mouse cortical neurons, which indicated that the compound blocked the synaptic toxicity of Abeta1-42. In vitro and in vivo effects presented here suggest that SEN1500 could be an interesting AD therapeutic.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid precursor protein (APP), encoded on Hsa21, functions as a cell adhesion molecule (CAM) in axonal growth cones (GCs) of the developing brain. We show here that axonal GCs of human fetal Down syndrome (DS) neurons (and of a DS mouse model) overexpress APP protein relative to euploid controls. We investigated whether DS neurons generate an abnormal, APP-dependent GC phenotype in vitro. On laminin, which binds APP and beta1 integrins (Itgb1), DS neurons formed enlarged and faster-advancing GCs compared to controls. On peptide matrices that bind APP only, but not on those binding exclusively Itgb1 or L1CAM, DS GCs were significantly enlarged (2.0-fold), formed increased close adhesions (1.8-fold), and advanced faster (1.4-fold). In assays involving alternating stripes of monospecific matrices, human control GCs exhibited no preference for any of the substrates, whereas DS GCs preferred the APP-binding matrix (cross-over decreased significantly from 48.2 to 27.2%). Reducing APP expression in DS GCs with siRNA normalized most measures of the phenotype, including substrate choice. These experiments show that human DS neurons exhibit an APP-dependent, abnormal GC phenotype characterized by increased adhesion and altered contact guidance. The results suggest that APP overexpression may perturb axonal pathfinding and circuit formation in developing DS brain.",

    "abstract": "Chronic inflammation induced by amyloid-beta (Abeta) plays a key role in the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8 may be associated with chronic inflammation in AMD. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) regulates inflammation via inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling, and resveratrol has been reported to prevent Abeta-induced retinal degeneration; therefore, we investigated whether this action was mediated via activation of SIRT1 signaling. Human adult retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were exposed to Abeta, and overactivation and knockdown of SIRT1 were performed to investigate whether SIRT1 is required for abrogating Abeta-induced inflammation. We found that Abeta-induced RPE barrier disruption and expression of IL-6, IL-8, and MMP-9 were abrogated by the SIRT1 activator SRT1720, whereas alterations induced by Abeta in SIRT1-silenced RPE cells were not attenuated by SRT1720. In addition, SRT1720 inhibited Abeta-mediated NF-kappaB activation and decrease of the NF-kappaB inhibitor, IkappaBalpha. Our findings suggest a protective role for SIRT1 signaling in Abeta-dependent retinal degeneration and inflammation in AMD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is associated with accumulation of extracellular beta amyloid peptide 42 (Abeta42) which may induce DNA damage and reduce cellular regenerative potential. These effects may be exacerbated under conditions of folate deficiency. The aim of this study was to investigate whether extracellular Abeta42 induces DNA damage and cell death in human peripheral lymphocytes and whether there is an interactive effect between extracellular Abeta42 and folic acid status. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured in medium under conditions of both low and high folate (20 and 200 nM, respectively) and challenged with either Abeta42 or the physiologically normal form Abeta40 (both at 5, 10, 15 microM). Genome stability and cytotoxicity events were investigated using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-cyt) assay. Outcome measures scored included the nuclear division index (NDI), necrosis, apoptosis, binucleated cells with micronuclei (MN), nucleoplasmic bridges (NPB), and nuclear buds (NBUD) and abnormally shaped nuclei (circular, (CIR) and horse-shoe, (HS) that may be indicative of mitotic disruption. Folic acid deficiency significantly reduced NDI (P < 0.001) and increased all the DNA damage biomarkers (MN, NPB, NBUD, HS, CIR), (P < 0.001). In contrast, exposure to Abeta40 had no impact on CBMN cytome biomarkers but Abeta42 significantly reduced NDI (P < 0.01), increased necrosis (P < 0.05) and frequency of cells with circular nuclei (P < 0.01). There was no evidence of an interaction between Abeta42 and folic acid with respect to CBMN cytome biomarkers. Extracellular Abeta42 appears to have cytotoxic and cytostatic effects but its effect on chromosomal instability appears to be small relative to folate deficiency.",

These properties are also shared by histidine-rich metal binding protein (HP) from moderate halophile, Chromohalobacter salexigens, used in this study. Here, we examined how halophilic proteins form amyloid fibrils in vitro. His-tagged HP, incubated at pH 2.0 and 58 C, readily formed amyloid fibrils, as observed by thioflavin fluorescence, CD spectra, and transmission or atomic force microscopies. Under these low-pH harsh conditions, however, His-HP was promptly hydrolyzed to smaller peptides most likely responsible for rapid formation of amyloid fibril. Three major acid-hydrolyzed peptides were isolated from fibrils and turned out to readily form fibrils. The synthetic peptides predicted to form fibrils in these peptide sequences by Waltz software also formed fibrils. Amyloid fibril was also readily formed from full-length His-HP when incubated with 10-20% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol at pH 7.8 and 25 C without peptide bond cleavage.",

Lanthionine ketimine and its synthetic derivatives have recently demonstrated neurotrophic, neuroprotective, and antineuroinflammatory properties in vitro through a proposed mechanism involving the microtubule-associated protein collapsin response mediator protein 2. Therefore, studies were undertaken to test the effects of a bioavailable LK ester in the 3 x Tg-AD mouse model of Alzheimer disease. Lanthionine ketimine ester treatment substantially diminished cognitive decline and brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide deposition and phospho-Tau accumulation in 3 x Tg-AD mice and also reduced the density of Iba1-positive microglia. Furthermore, LK ester treatment altered collapsin response mediator protein 2 phosphorylation. These findings suggest that LK may not be a metabolic waste but rather a purposeful neurochemical, the synthetic derivatives of which constitute a new class of experimental therapeutics for Alzheimer disease and related entities.",

    "abstract": "Increased cytosolic phospholipase A2alpha (cPLA2alpha) immunoreactivity and transcript were observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain associated with amyloid deposits. Thus, the present study examined whether cPLA2alpha upregulation participate in cortical neuron damage induced by aggregated Abeta1-42 and determined its role in the signaling events leading to damage, using an antisense technology. Exposure of primary cortical neurons to 1muM aggregated Abeta1-42 for 24h induced up-regulation and activation of cPLA2alpha and apoptotic cell death of about 30% as detected by: cell count, MTT reduction, caspases-3 and -8 activation, DAPI and TUNEL staining, that were prevented by inhibition of cPLA2alpha up-regulation and activity in the presence of antisense against cPLA2alpha (AS). cPLA2alpha was rapidly activated upon addition of aggregated Abeta1-42, as determined by its phosphorylated form on serine 505, and this activity was dependent on NADPH oxidase activity. NOX2- and NOX4-NADPH oxidase upregulation at 24h of aggregated Abeta1-42 exposure was not affected by the presence of AS, but superoxide production was reduced, probably due to NOX2 inhibition. cPLA2alpha upregulation led to activation of neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) as its activity was inhibited in the presence of AS, and could be restored by addition of arachidonic acid. Addition of ceramide analog induced caspase-8 activation leading to caspase-3 activation and apoptotic neuronal death. In conclusion, our results suggest that cPLA2alpha activity plays a crucial role in the signaling cascade leading to apoptotic neuronal death by aggregated Abeta1-42 probably via activation of N-SMase, ceramide production and caspases-3 and -8.",

We report that murine PirB (paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B) and its human ortholog LilrB2 (leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B2), present in human brain, are receptors for Abeta oligomers, with nanomolar affinity. The first two extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) domains of PirB and LilrB2 mediate this interaction, leading to enhanced cofilin signaling, also seen in human AD brains. In mice, the deleterious effect of Abeta oligomers on hippocampal long-term potentiation required PirB, and in a transgenic model of AD, PirB not only contributed to memory deficits present in adult mice, but also mediated loss of synaptic plasticity in juvenile visual cortex. These findings imply that LilrB2 contributes to human AD neuropathology and suggest therapeutic uses of blocking LilrB2 function.",

We identified two rare mutations (Q170H and R181G) in the prodomain of the metalloprotease, ADAM10, that cosegregate with late-onset AD (LOAD). Here, we addressed the pathogenicity of these mutations in transgenic mice expressing human ADAM10 in brain. In Tg2576 AD mice, both mutations attenuated alpha-secretase activity of ADAM10 and shifted APP processing toward beta-secretase-mediated cleavage, while enhancing Abeta plaque load and reactive gliosis. We also demonstrated ADAM10 expression potentiates adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which is reduced by the LOAD mutations. Mechanistically, both LOAD mutations impaired the molecular chaperone activity of ADAM10 prodomain. Collectively, these findings suggest that diminished alpha-secretase activity, owing to LOAD ADAM10 prodomain mutations, leads to AD-related pathology, strongly supporting ADAM10 as a promising therapeutic target for this devastating disease.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic decay and neurodegeneration are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease that are thought to precede dementia. Recently, we have reported that the first signs of neuritic dystrophy in a new transgenic mouse model of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) called the \"5xFAD\" are axonal dystrophy followed by loss of spines on basal dendrites. The 5xFAD mouse has profound loss of layer 5 neurons by 12months, and these initial structural insults appear between 4 and 6months of age. Here, we test, for the first time, if synaptic failure of layer 5 neurons in the 5xFAD mouse precedes these structural changes. We used longitudinal, in vivo two-photon fluorescence imaging of bigenic 5xFAD/YFP mice to assess the overall structural stability of layer 5 neurons in young mice (age less than 14weeks). We found these neurons to be structurally and morphologically sound. In parallel, we used in vitro, whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, from mice aged 8-12weeks, to reveal significant pre- and postsynaptic defects in these cells. Thus our data suggest that layer 5 neurons in the 5xFAD mouse model have synaptic deficits at an early time point, before any overt structural dystrophy, and that such synaptic failure, with co-temporal biochemical changes, may be an early step in neuronal loss.",

    "abstract": "Recently, increasing evidences have indicated that abnormal behavior and white matter changes had appeared before senile plaques were formed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the exact nature of these changes in behavior and white matter structure in early AD are unclear. This study used the Morris water maze, an ELISA assay, a transmission electron microscopic technique and new stereological methods to investigate the behavior, Abeta protein expression and white matter structure of Tg2576 transgenic mice at four ages. Only 10 months of age, the time latency in the Morris water maze tasks for Tg2576 transgenic mice were significantly longer than that of wild-type mice. The concentration of Abeta40 protein in the white matter of the Tg2576 transgenic mice was significantly increased in four ages mice, but the Abeta42 protein was significantly increased only in the 6-month-old mice. In 10-month-old mice, the axon volume in the white matter of the Tg2576 transgenic mice was significantly decreased when compared to the wild-type mice. These results suggest that the deposition of Abeta in the white matter of Tg2576 transgenic mice appeared before the spatial memory decline. The early detection of the Abeta content in the white matter of AD might help diagnose suspected AD. In addition, the axon changes in the white matter of AD might be one of the morphological causes of the behavioral deficits observed in 10-month-old transgenic mouse models of AD, and protecting the axons in the white matter might be an important method for delaying the progression of AD.",

Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), exerts detrimental effects on synapses, a process thought to be causally related to the cognitive deficits in AD. Here, we used in vivo two-photon microscopy to characterize the dynamics of axonal boutons and dendritic spines in APP/Presenilin 1 (APP(swe)/PS1(L166P))-green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice. Time-lapse imaging over 4 weeks revealed a pronounced, concerted instability of pre- and postsynaptic structures within the vicinity of amyloid plaques. Treatment with a novel sulfonamide-type gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) attenuated the formation and growth of new plaques and, most importantly, led to a normalization of the enhanced dynamics of synaptic structures close to plaques. GSI treatment did neither affect spines and boutons distant from plaques in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1-GFP (APPPS1-GFP) nor those in GFP-control mice, suggesting no obvious neuropathological side effects of the drug.",

    "abstract": "Mislocalization and aggregation of Abeta and Tau combined with loss of synapses and microtubules (MTs) are hallmarks of Alzheimer disease. We exposed mature primary neurons to Abeta oligomers and analysed changes in the Tau/MT system. MT breakdown occurs in dendrites invaded by Tau (Tau missorting) and is mediated by spastin, an MT-severing enzyme. Spastin is recruited by MT polyglutamylation, induced by Tau missorting triggered translocalization of TTLL6 (Tubulin-Tyrosine-Ligase-Like-6) into dendrites. Consequences are spine loss and mitochondria and neurofilament mislocalization. Missorted Tau is not axonally derived, as shown by axonal retention of photoconvertible Dendra2-Tau, but newly synthesized. Recovery from Abeta insult occurs after Abeta oligomers lose their toxicity and requires the kinase MARK (Microtubule-Affinity-Regulating-Kinase). In neurons derived from Tau-knockout mice, MTs and synapses are resistant to Abeta toxicity because TTLL6 mislocalization and MT polyglutamylation are prevented; hence no spastin recruitment and no MT breakdown occur, enabling faster recovery. Reintroduction of Tau re-establishes Abeta-induced toxicity in TauKO neurons, which requires phosphorylation of Tau's KXGS motifs. Transgenic mice overexpressing Tau show TTLL6 translocalization into dendrites and decreased MT stability. The results provide a rationale for MT stabilization as a therapeutic approach.",

    "abstract": "Using a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we systematically evaluated 67 candidate genes based on AD-associated genomic loci (P < 10(-4)) from published human genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Genetic manipulation of 87 homologous fly genes was tested for modulation of neurotoxicity caused by human Tau, which forms neurofibrillary tangle pathology in AD. RNA interference (RNAi) targeting 9 genes enhanced Tau neurotoxicity, and in most cases reciprocal activation of gene expression suppressed Tau toxicity. Our screen implicates cindr, the fly ortholog of the human CD2AP AD susceptibility gene, as a modulator of Tau-mediated disease mechanisms. Importantly, we also identify the fly orthologs of FERMT2 and CELF1 as Tau modifiers, and these loci have been independently validated as AD susceptibility loci in the latest GWAS meta-analysis. Both CD2AP and FERMT2 have been previously implicated with roles in cell adhesion, and our screen additionally identifies a fly homolog of the human integrin adhesion receptors, ITGAM and ITGA9, as a modifier of Tau neurotoxicity. Our results highlight cell adhesion pathways as important in Tau toxicity and AD susceptibility and demonstrate the power of model organism genetic screens for the functional follow-up of human GWAS.",

    "abstract": "The hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the aggregates of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and tau protein. Autophagy is a major cellular pathway leading to the removal of aggregated proteins. We have reported recently that autophagy was responsible for amyloid precursor protein cleaved C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF) degradation and amyloid beta clearance in an Atg5-dependent manner. Here we aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which autophagy mediates the degradation of APP-CTF and the clearance of amyloid beta. Through affinity purification followed by mass spectrum analysis, we identified adaptor protein (AP) 2 together with phosphatidylinositol clathrin assembly lymphoid-myeloid leukemia (PICALM) as binding proteins of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). Further analysis showed that AP2 regulated the cellular levels of APP-CTF. Knockdown of AP2 reduced autophagy-mediated APP-CTF degradation. Immunoprecipitation and live imaging analysis demonstrated that AP2 and PICALM cross-link LC3 with APP-CTF. These data suggest that the AP-2/PICALM complex functions as an autophagic cargo receptor for the recognition and shipment of APP-CTF from the endocytic pathway to the LC3-marked autophagic degradation pathway. This molecular mechanism linking AP2/PICALM and AD is consistent with genetic evidence indicating a role for PICALM as a risk factor for AD.",

    "title": "Improvement of spatial memory function in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice after chronic inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 4D.",
    "abstract": "Phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitors (PDE4-Is) have received increasing attention as cognition-enhancers and putative treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). By preventing cAMP breakdown, PDE4-Is can enhance intracellular signal transduction and increase the phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and transcription of proteins related to synaptic plasticity and associated memory formation. Unfortunately, clinical development of PDE4-Is has been seriously hampered by emetic side effects. The new isoform-specific PDE4D-I, GEBR-7b, has shown to have beneficial effects on memory at non-emetic doses. The aim of the current study was to investigate chronic cognition-enhancing effects of GEBR-7b in a mouse model of AD. To this extent, 5-month-old (5M) APPswe/PS1dE9 mice received daily subcutaneous injections with GEBR-7b (0.001 mg/kg) or vehicle for a period of 3 weeks, and were tested on affective and cognitive behavior at 7M. We demonstrated a cognition-enhancing potential in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice as their spatial memory function at 7M in the object location test was improved by prior GEBR-7b treatment. APPswe/PS1dE9 mice displayed lower levels of CREB phosphorylation, which remained unaltered after chronic GEBR-7b treatment, and higher levels of tau in the hippocampus. Hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels and synaptic densities were not different between experimental groups and no effects were observed on hippocampal GSK3beta and tau phosphorylation or Abeta levels. In conclusion, GEBR-7b can enhance spatial memory function in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of AD. Although the underlying mechanisms of its cognition-enhancing potential remain to be elucidated, PDE4D inhibition appears an interesting novel therapeutic option for cognitive deficits in AD.",

However, BDNF treatment after disease onset has not been reported to improve neuronal survival in these models. We now report prevention of neuronal loss with early life BDNF treatment in mutant mice expressing two amyloid precursor protein (APP) mutations associated with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease. APP transgenic mice underwent lentiviral BDNF gene delivery into the entorhinal cortices at age 2 months and were examined 5 months later. BDNF-treated mice exhibited significant improvements in hippocampal-dependent contextual fear conditioning compared with control-treated APP mice (p < 0.05). Stereological analysis of entorhinal cortical cell number demonstrated ~20% reductions in neuronal number in layers II-VI of the entorhinal cortex in untreated APP mutant mice compared with wild-type mice (p < 0.0001), and significant amelioration of cell loss by BDNF (p < 0.001). Moreover, BDNF gene delivery improved synaptophysin immunoreactivity in the entorhinal cortex and, through anterograde BDNF transport, in the hippocampus (p < 0.01). Notably, BDNF did not affect amyloid plaque numbers, indicating that direct amyloid reduction is not necessary to achieve significant neuroprotective benefits in mutant amyloid models of Alzheimer's disease.",

This hypothesis maintains that gene inheritance defines an individual's baseline mitochondrial function; inherited and environmental factors determine rates at which mitochondrial function changes over time; and baseline mitochondrial function and mitochondrial change rates influence AD chronology. Our hypothesis unequivocally states in sporadic, late-onset AD, mitochondrial function affects amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression, APP processing, or beta amyloid (Abeta) accumulation and argues if an amyloid cascade truly exists, mitochondrial function triggers it. We now review the state of the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis, and discuss it in the context of recent AD biomarker studies, diagnostic criteria, and clinical trials. Our hypothesis predicts that biomarker changes reflect brain aging, new AD definitions clinically stage brain aging, and removing brain Abeta at any point will marginally impact cognitive trajectories. Our hypothesis, therefore, offers unique perspective into what sporadic, late-onset AD is and how to best treat it.",

    "title": "FLZ inhibited gamma-secretase selectively and decreased Abeta mitochondrial production in APP-SH-SY5Y cells.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism is a key factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-beta (Abeta) in mitochondria comes from APP mitochondrial metabolism or from the uptake Abeta from outside of mitochondria. It has been recently proposed that mitochondria are involved in the biochemical pathways through which Abeta causes neuronal dysfunction. The accumulated Abeta in mitochondria decreases the level of cytochrome c oxidase (COX IV) and attenuates the ATP production consequently. FLZ is a synthetic cyclic derivative of squamosamide from Annona glabra. In this study, the effect of FLZ on APP processing in mitochondria was investigated in SH-SY5Y cells over-expressing APP695 (wt/Swe). FLZ treatment attenuated APP processing and decreased Abeta production in mitochondria. The mitochondrial function was increased with the upregulation of COX IV both at protein and activity levels. ATP production was also increased after FLZ treatment. The mechanistic study showed that FLZ inhibited gamma-secretase activity by decreasing C-terminal fragment protein level of presenilin, the active center of gamma-secretase. The effect of FLZ differs from DAPT (a non-selective gamma-secretase inhibitor), suggesting FLZ is a selective gamma-secretase inhibitor. FLZ selectively inhibited gamma-secretase in the cleavage of recombinant C terminus of APP in vitro, without specifically modulating the processing of recombinant Notch intracellular domain. These results indicate that FLZ decreases Abeta accumulation in mitochondria by selectively inhibiting gamma-secretase. We propose that FLZ is a potential anti-AD drug candidate, and its mechanism may be improving mitochondrial function by reducing the Abeta burden in mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to be associated with microcirculatory injury, capillary blockage, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Endothelial dysfunction has also been reported to be associated with AD, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) is an N-glycosylated type I membrane protein that enhances the activation of protein C. However, the effects of EPCR and protein C in AD are still unknown. In this study, we found that the expression of EPCR was reduced in the brains of beta-amyloid precursor protein overexpressing Tg2576 transgenic mice at both the mRNA level and the protein level. However, levels of thrombomodulin (TM) did not undergo any changes. An in vitro study displayed that beta-amyloid (Abeta) treatment led to suppression of EPCR along with reduction of protein C activation in mouse primary endothelial cells. Further study revealed that the induction of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun pathway plays a causal role in the inhibitory effects of Abeta1-42 on the expression of EPCR. As a transcriptional factor, c-Jun was able to transinactivate the EPCR promoter. Finally, we found that c-Jun silencing or the use of a JNK inhibitor could attenuate the effects of Abeta1-42 in the activation of protein C.",

    "abstract": "Small-molecule Tau aggregation inhibitors are under investigation as potential therapeutic agents against Alzheimer disease. Many such inhibitors have been identified in vitro, but their potency-driving features, and their molecular targets in the Tau aggregation pathway, have resisted identification. Previously we proposed ligand polarizability, a measure of electron delocalization, as a candidate descriptor of inhibitor potency. Here we tested this hypothesis by correlating the ground state polarizabilities of cyanine, phenothiazine, and arylmethine derivatives calculated using ab initio quantum methods with inhibitory potency values determined in the presence of octadecyl sulfate inducer under reducing conditions. A series of rhodanine analogs was analyzed as well using potency values disclosed in the literature. Results showed that polarizability and inhibitory potency directly correlated within all four series. To identify putative binding targets, representative members of the four chemotypes were added to aggregation reactions, where they were found to stabilize soluble, but SDS-resistant Tau species at the expense of filamentous aggregates. Using SDS resistance as a secondary assay, and a library of Tau deletion and missense mutants as targets, interaction with cyanine was localized to the microtubule binding repeat region. Moreover, the SDS-resistant phenotype was completely dependent on the presence of octadecyl sulfate inducer, but not intact PHF6/PH6* hexapeptide motifs, indicating that cyanine interacted with a species in the aggregation pathway prior to nucleus formation. Together the data suggest that flat, highly polarizable ligands inhibit Tau aggregation by interacting with folded species in the aggregation pathway and driving their assembly into soluble but highly stable Tau oligomers.",

We report that an O-acyl isopeptide of Abeta1-42 (1) containing an ester bond at the Gly(25)-Ser(26) moiety inhibits Abeta1-42 fibril formation at equimolar ratio. Inhibitory activity was retained by an N-Me-beta-Ala(26) derivative (2), in which the ester of 1 was replaced with N-methyl amide to improve chemical stability at physiological pH. Inhibition was verified by fluorescence anisotropy, Western blot, and atomic force microscopy. This report suggests a new class of Abeta aggregation inhibitor based on modification of Abeta1-42 at Gly(25)-Ser(26).",

    "abstract": "Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) and its signaling adaptor protein TYROBP/DAP12 play important roles in signal transduction in dendritic cells, osteoclasts, tissue macrophages, and microglia. Recently, TREM2 variants have been shown to be linked to late onset Alzheimer disease. Here, we demonstrate that TREM2 undergoes sequential proteolytic processing by ectodomain shedding and intramembrane proteolysis. The C-terminal fragment (CTF) of TREM2 generated by ectodomain shedding is cleaved by gamma-secretase. Importantly, pharmacologic and genetic gamma-secretase inhibition resulted in accumulation of TREM2 CTF at the plasma membrane that also interacts with the signaling adaptor protein DAP12. Thus, the accumulated TREM2 CTF thereby might limit the interaction of DAP12 with the functional full-length receptor, resulting in decreased DAP12 phosphorylation and impaired metabolism of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Together, these data demonstrate gamma-secretase-mediated intramembranous proteolysis of TREM2 and functionally link two Alzheimer disease-associated proteins in one signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) has an important role in inflammation and the innate immune response, but its role in the central nervous system is less well understood. Here, we examined the role of STAT1 in spatial learning and memory, and assessed the involvement of STAT1 in mediating the memory-impairing effect of amyloid-beta (Abeta). We found that water maze training downregulated STAT1 expression in the rat hippocampal CA1 area, and spatial learning and memory function was enhanced in Stat1-knockout mice. Conversely, overexpression of STAT1 impaired water maze performance. STAT1 strongly upregulated the expression of the extracellular matrix protein laminin beta1 (LB1), which also impaired water maze performance in rats. Furthermore, Abeta impaired spatial learning and memory in association with a dose-dependent increase in STAT1 and LB1 expression, but knockdown of STAT1 and LB1 both reversed this effect of Abeta. This Abeta-induced increase in STAT1 and LB1 expression was also associated with a decrease in the expression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits, NR1, and NR2B. Overexpression of NR1 or NR2B or exogenous application of NMDA reversed Abeta-induced learning and memory deficits as well as Abeta-induced STAT1 and LB1 expression. Our results demonstrate that STAT1 negatively regulates spatial learning and memory through transcriptional regulation of LB1 expression. We also identified a novel mechanism for Abeta pathogenesis through STAT1 induction. Notably, impairment of spatial learning and memory by this STAT1-mediated mechanism is independent of cAMP responsive element-binding protein signaling.",

    "abstract": "Depending upon the stimulus, neuronal cell death can either be triggered from the cell body (soma) or the axon. We investigated the origin of the degeneration signal in amyloid beta (Abeta) induced neuronal cell death in cultured in vitro hippocampal neurons. We discovered that Abeta1-42 toxicity-induced axon degeneration precedes cell death in hippocampal neurons. Overexpression of Bcl-xl inhibited both axonal and cell body degeneration in the Abeta-42 treated neurons. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (Nmnat1) blocks axon degeneration in a variety of paradigms, but it cannot block neuronal cell body death. Therefore, if the neuronal death signals in Abeta1-42 toxicity originate from degenerating axons, we should be able to block neuronal death by inhibiting axon degeneration. To explore this possibility we over-expressed Nmnat1 in hippocampal neurons. We found that inhibition of axon degeneration in Abeta1-42 treated neurons prevented neuronal cell death. Thus, we conclude that axon degeneration is the key component of Abeta1-42 induced neuronal degeneration, and therapies targeting axonal protection can be important in finding a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Post-mortem brains from Down syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients show an upregulation of the Down syndrome critical region 1 protein (DSCR1), but its contribution to AD is not known. To gain insights into the role of DSCR1 in AD, we explored the functional interaction between DSCR1 and the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is known to cause AD when duplicated or upregulated in DS. We find that the Drosophila homolog of DSCR1, Nebula, delays neurodegeneration and ameliorates axonal transport defects caused by APP overexpression. Live-imaging reveals that Nebula facilitates the transport of synaptic proteins and mitochondria affected by APP upregulation. Furthermore, we show that Nebula upregulation protects against axonal transport defects by restoring calcineurin and GSK-3beta signaling altered by APP overexpression, thereby preserving cargo-motor interactions. As impaired transport of essential organelles caused by APP perturbation is thought to be an underlying cause of synaptic failure and neurodegeneration in AD, our findings imply that correcting calcineurin and GSK-3beta signaling can prevent APP-induced pathologies. Our data further suggest that upregulation of Nebula/DSCR1 is neuroprotective in the presence of APP upregulation and provides evidence for calcineurin inhibition as a novel target for therapeutic intervention in preventing axonal transport impairments associated with AD.",

    "abstract": "Deposits of fibrils formed by disease-specific proteins are the molecular hallmark of such diverse human disorders as Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes, or rheumatoid arthritis. Amyloid fibril formation by structurally and functionally unrelated proteins exhibits many generic characteristics, most prominently the cross beta-sheet structure of their mature fibrils. At the same time, amyloid formation tends to proceed along one of two separate assembly pathways yielding either stiff monomeric filaments or globular oligomers and curvilinear protofibrils. Given the focus on oligomers as major toxic species, the very existence of an oligomer-free assembly pathway is significant. Little is known, though, about the structure of the various intermediates emerging along different pathways and whether the pathways converge towards a common or distinct fibril structures. Using infrared spectroscopy we probed the structural evolution of intermediates and late-stage fibrils formed during in vitro lysozyme amyloid assembly along an oligomeric and oligomer-free pathway. Infrared spectroscopy confirmed that both pathways produced amyloid-specific beta-sheet peaks, but at pathway-specific wavenumbers. We further found that the amyloid-specific dye thioflavin T responded to all intermediates along either pathway. The relative amplitudes of thioflavin T fluorescence responses displayed pathway-specific differences and could be utilized for monitoring the structural evolution of intermediates. Pathway-specific structural features obtained from infrared spectroscopy and Thioflavin T responses were identical for fibrils grown at highly acidic or at physiological pH values and showed no discernible effects of protein hydrolysis. Our results suggest that late-stage fibrils formed along either pathway are amyloidogenic in nature, but have distinguishable structural fingerprints. These pathway-specific fingerprints emerge during the earliest aggregation events and persist throughout the entire cascade of aggregation intermediates formed along each pathway.",

    "abstract": "A highly sensitive immunoassay, the immunomagnetic reduction, is used to measure several biomarkers for plasma that is related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). These biomarkers include Abeta-40, Abeta-42, and tau proteins. The samples are composed of four groups: healthy controls (n=66), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n=22), very mild dementia (n=23), and mild-to-serve dementia, all due to AD (n=22). It is found that the concentrations of both Abeta-42 and tau protein for the healthy controls are significantly lower than those of all of the other groups. The sensitivity and the specificity of plasma Abeta-42 and tau protein in differentiating MCI from AD are all around 0.9 (0.88-0.97). However, neither plasma Abeta-42 nor tau-protein concentration is an adequate parameter to distinguish MCI from AD. A parameter is proposed, which is the product of plasma Abeta-42 and tau-protein levels, to differentiate MCI from AD. The sensitivity and specificity are found to be 0.80 and 0.82, respectively. It is concluded that the use of combined plasma biomarkers not only allows the differentiation of the healthy controls and patients with AD in both the prodromal phase and the dementia phase, but it also allows AD in the prodromal phase to be distinguished from that in the dementia phase.",

    "abstract": "Schisandra chinensis is commonly used for food and as a traditional remedy for the treatment of neuronal disorders. However, it is unclear which component of S. chinensis is responsible for its neuropharmacological effects. To answer this question, we isolated alpha-iso-cubebene, a dibenzocyclooctadiene lignin, from S. chinensis and determined if it has any anti-neuroinflammatory and neuroprotective properties against amyloid beta-induced neuroinflammation in microglia. Microglia that are stimulated by amyloid beta increased their production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the enzymatic activity of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). We found this was all inhibited by alpha-iso-cubebene. Consistent with these results, alpha-iso-cubebene inhibited the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and MMP-9 in amyloid beta-stimulated microglia. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed that alpha-iso-cubebene inhibited the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB-alpha, the phosphorylation and transactivity of NF-kappaB, and the phosphorylation of MAPK in amyloid beta-stimulated microglia. These results suggest that alpha-iso-cubebene impairs the amyloid beta-induced neuroinflammatory response of microglia by inhibiting the NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways. Importantly, alpha-iso-cubebene can provide critical neuroprotection for primary cortical neurons against amyloid beta-stimulated microglia-mediated neurotoxicity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing that alpha-iso-cubebene can provide neuroprotection against, and influence neuroinflammation triggered by, amyloid beta activation of microglia.",

    "abstract": "Human serum albumin (HSA) is a potent inhibitor of Abeta self-association and this novel, to our knowledge, function of HSA is of potential therapeutic interest for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. It is known that HSA interacts with Abeta oligomers through binding sites evenly partitioned across the three albumin domains and with comparable affinities. However, as of this writing, no information is available on the HSA-Abeta interactions beyond domain resolution. Here, we map the HSA-Abeta interactions at subdomain and peptide resolution. We show that each separate subdomain of HSA domain 3 inhibits Abeta self-association. We also show that fatty acids (FAs) compete with Abeta oligomers for binding to domain 3, but the determinant of the HSA/Abeta oligomer interactions are markedly distinct from those of FAs. Although salt bridges with the FA carboxylate determine the FA binding affinities, hydrophobic contacts are pivotal for Abeta oligomer recognition. Specifically, we identified a site of Abeta oligomer recognition that spans the HSA (494-515) region and aligns with the central hydrophobic core of Abeta. The HSA (495-515) segment includes residues affected by FA binding and this segment is prone to self-associate into beta-amyloids, suggesting that sites involved in fibrilization may provide a lead to develop inhibitors of Abeta self-association.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is a multifunctional kinase implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the synaptic actions of GSK-3 in AD conditions are largely unknown. In this study, we examined the impact of GSK-3 on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) channels, the major mediator of synaptic plasticity. Application of GSK-3 inhibitors or knockdown of GSK-3 caused a significant reduction of NMDAR-mediated ionic and synaptic current in cortical neurons, whereas this effect of GSK-3 was impaired in cortical neurons treated with beta-amyloid (Abeta) or from transgenic mice overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein. GSK-3 activity was elevated by Abeta, and GSK-3 inhibitors failed to decrease the surface expression of NMDA receptor NR1 (NR1) and NR1/postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) interaction in amyloid precursor protein mice, which was associated with the diminished GSK-3 regulation of Rab5 activity that mediates NMDAR internalization. Consequently, GSK-3 inhibitor lost the capability of protecting neurons against N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced excitotoxicity in Abeta-treated neurons. These results have provided a novel mechanism underlying the involvement of GSK-3 in AD.",

The generation of transgenic mice with presence of AD pathologies that cause learning and memory deficits has led to improved understanding of the behavioral and pathophysiological processes underlying AD. A novel APP/PS1 mouse model in the senescence accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) background--SAMP8 APP/PS1 was generated. To assess the behavioral and other AD-related changes in this SAMP8 APP/PS1 model, the present report covers a phenotypical analysis of this model for working memory, spatial memory, motor performance and anxiety-like behavior. SAMP8 APP/PS1 mice showed motor and spatial memory impairments, together with an increase of locomotor activity and lower anxiety-like behavior at 9months old. In contrast, C57 APP/PS1 and SAMP8 wild type mice were inconspicuous in all of these tasks and properties except C57 APP/PS1 mice which showed motor memory impairment in the shuttle box task at 9 months old. Standard senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-GAL) staining and amyloid beta (Abeta) immunohistochemistry showed more severe pathological changes in the SAMP8 APP/PS1 mice. SAMP8 APP/PS1 mice exhibited earlier deficits in their non-cognitive and cognitive behaviors which are coincident in the AD patient and the results suggest that this new type of mice might be a better model for studying the age-related dementia of the Alzheimer type and for assessing the potential therapeutic agents for AD.",

In the present study, the neuroprotective properties of TQ were investigated by studying its anti-apoptotic potential to diminish beta-amyloid peptide 1-40 sequence (Abeta1-40)-induced neuronal cell death in primary cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). The effects of TQ against Abeta1-40-induced neurotoxicity, morphological damages, DNA condensation, the generation of reactive oxygen species, and caspase-3, -8, and -9 activation were investigated. Pretreatment of CGNs with TQ (0.1 and 1 muM) and subsequent exposure to 10 muM Abeta1-40 protected the CGNs against the neurotoxic effects of the latter. In addition, the CGNs were better preserved with intact cell bodies, extensive neurite networks, a loss of condensed chromatin and less free radical generation than those exposed to Abeta1-40 alone. TQ pretreatment inhibited Abeta1-40-induced apoptosis of CGNs via both extrinsic and intrinsic caspase pathways. Thus, the findings of this study suggest that TQ may prevent neurotoxicity and Abeta1-40-induced apoptosis. TQ is, therefore, worth studying further for its potential to reduce the risks of developing Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Differential, dominant activation and inhibition of Notch signalling and APP cleavage by truncations of PSEN1 in human disease.",
    "abstract": "PRESENILIN1 (PSEN1) is the major locus for mutations causing familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) and is also mutated in Pick disease of brain, familial acne inversa and dilated cardiomyopathy. It is a critical facilitator of Notch signalling and many other signalling pathways and protein cleavage events including production of the Amyloidbeta (Abeta) peptide from the AMYLOID BETA A4 PRECURSOR PROTEIN (APP). We previously reported that interference with splicing of transcripts of the zebrafish orthologue of PSEN1 creates dominant negative effects on Notch signalling. Here, we extend this work to show that various truncations of human PSEN1 (or zebrafish Psen1) protein have starkly differential effects on Notch signalling and cleavage of zebrafish Appa (a paralogue of human APP). Different truncations can suppress or stimulate Notch signalling but not Appa cleavage and vice versa. The G183V mutation possibly causing Pick disease causes production of aberrant transcripts truncating the open reading frame after exon 5 sequence. We show that the truncated protein potentially translated from these transcripts avidly incorporates into very stable Psen1-dependent higher molecular weight complexes and suppresses cleavage of Appa but not Notch signalling. In contrast, the truncated protein potentially produced by the P242LfsX11 acne inversa mutation has no effect on Appa cleavage but, unexpectedly, enhances Notch signalling. Our results suggest novel hypotheses for the pathological mechanisms underlying these diseases and illustrate the importance of investigating the function of dominant mutations at physiologically relevant expression levels and in the normally heterozygous state in which they cause human disease rather than in isolation from healthy alleles.",

    "title": "Altered CpG methylation in sporadic Alzheimer's disease is associated with APP and MAPT dysregulation.",
    "abstract": "The hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is an accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) and phosphorylated tau, which are encoded by the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) genes, respectively. Less than 5% of all AD cases are familial in nature, i.e. caused by mutations in APP, PSEN1 or PSEN2. Almost all mutations found in them are related to an overproduction of Abeta1-42, which is prone to aggregation. While these genes are mutation free, their function, or those of related genes, could be compromised in sporadic AD as well. In this study, pyrosequencing analysis of post-mortem brains revealed aberrant CpG methylation in APP, MAPT and GSK3B genes of the AD brain. These changes were further evaluated by a newly developed in vitro-specific DNA methylation system, which in turn highlighted an enhanced expression of APP and MAPT. Cell nucleus sorting of post-mortem brains revealed that the methylation changes of APP and MAPT occurred in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells, whereas GSK3B was abnormally methylated in non-neuronal cells. Further analysis revealed an association between abnormal APP CpG methylation and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele (APOE epsilon4)-negative cases. The presence of a small number of highly methylated neurons among normal neurons contribute to the methylation difference in APP and MAPT CpGs, thus abnormally methylated cells could compromise the neural circuit and/or serve as 'seed cells' for abnormal protein propagation. Our results provide a link between familial AD genes and sporadic neuropathology, thus emphasizing an epigenetic pathomechanism for sporadic AD.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by an abnormal aggregation of misfolded beta-sheet rich proteins such as beta-amyloid (Abeta). Various ubiquitously expressed molecular chaperones control the correct folding of cellular proteins and prevent the accumulation of harmful species. We here describe a novel anti-aggregant chaperone function for the neuroendocrine protein proSAAS, an abundant secretory polypeptide that is widely expressed within neural and endocrine tissues and which has previously been associated with neurodegenerative disease in various proteomics studies. In the brains of 12-month-old APdE9 mice, and in the cortex of a human AD-affected brain, proSAAS immunoreactivity was highly colocalized with amyloid pathology. Immunoreactive proSAAS co-immunoprecipitated with Abeta immunoreactivity in lysates from APdE9 mouse brains. In vitro, proSAAS efficiently prevented the fibrillation of Abeta(1-42) at molar ratios of 1 : 10, and this anti-aggregation effect was dose dependent. Structure-function studies showed that residues 97-180 were sufficient for the anti-aggregation function against Abeta. Finally, inclusion of recombinant proSAAS in the medium of Neuro2a cells, as well as lentiviral-mediated proSAAS over-expression, blocked the neurocytotoxic effect of Abeta(1-42) in Neuro2a cells. Taken together, our results suggest that proSAAS may play a role in Alzheimer's disease pathology.",

However, it is widely believed that gamma-secretase is a promiscuous protease and that its substrate-specific inhibition is elusive. Here we show that gamma-secretase distinguishes the ectodomain length of substrates and preferentially captures and cleaves substrates containing a short ectodomain. We also show that a subset of peptides containing the CDCYCxxxxCxCxSC motif binds to the amino terminus of C99 and inhibits Abeta production in a substrate-specific manner. Interestingly, these peptides suppress beta-secretase-dependent cleavage of APP, but not that of sialyltransferase 1. Most importantly, intraperitoneal administration of peptides into mice results in a significant reduction in cerebral Abeta levels. This report provides direct evidence of the substrate preference of gamma-secretase and its mechanism. Our results demonstrate that the ectodomain of C99 is a potent target for substrate-specific anti-Abeta therapeutics to combat Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism by which amyloid-beta (Abeta) produces brain dysfunction in patients with Alzheimer's disease is largely unknown. According to previous studies, Abeta might share perforating properties with gramicidin, a well-accepted membrane-disrupting peptide. Therefore, we hypothesize that the key steps leading to synaptotoxicity by Abeta and gramicidin involve peptide aggregation, pore formation, and calcium dysregulation. Here, we show that Abeta and gramicidin form aggregates enriched in beta-sheet structures using electron microscopy, and Thioflavin and Congo Red staining techniques. Also, we found that Abeta and gramicidin display fairly similar actions in hippocampal cell membranes, i.e. inducing Ca(2+) entry and synaptoxicity characterized by the loss of synaptic proteins and a decrease in neuronal viability. These effects were not observed in a Ca(2+) free solution, indicating that both Abeta and gramicidin induce neurotoxicity by a Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism. Using combined perforated patch clamp and imaging recordings, we found that only Abeta produced a perforation that progressed from a small (Cl(-)-selective pore) to a larger perforation that allowed the entry of fluorescent molecules. Therefore, based on these results, we propose that the perforation at the plasma membrane by Abeta is a dynamic process that is critical in producing neurotoxicity similar to that found in the brains of AD patients.",

In the last years, abnormalities of lipid metabolism and in particular of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been recently linked with the development of the disease. According to the recent studies showing how hydroxylation of fatty acids enhances their biological activity, here we show that chronic treatment with a hydroxylated derivative of DHA, the 2-hydroxy-DHA (2OHDHA) in the 5XFAD transgenic mice model of AD improves performance in the radial arm maze test and restores cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus, with no changes in the presence of beta amyloid (Abeta) plaques.

In the current study, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography was used to enrich and concentrate tau prior to western-blot analysis. Multiple N-terminal and mid-domain fragments of tau were detected in pooled CSF with apparent sizes ranging from <20 kDa to ~40 kDa. The pattern of tau fragments in AD and control samples were similar. In contrast, full-length tau and C-terminal-containing fragments were not detected. To quantify levels, five tau ELISAs and three ptau ELISAs were developed to detect different overlapping regions of the protein. The discriminatory potential of each assay was determined using 20 AD and 20 age-matched control CSF samples. Of the tau ELISAs, the two assays specific for tau containing N-terminal sequences, amino acids 9-198 (numbering based on tau 441) and 9-163, exhibited the most significant differences between AD and control samples. In contrast, CSF tau was not detected with an ELISA specific for a more C-terminal region (amino acids 159-335). Significant discrimination was also observed with ptau assays measuring amino acids 159-p181 and 159-p231. Interestingly, the discriminatory potential of p181 was reduced when measured in the context of tau species containing amino acids 9-p181. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tau in CSF occurs as a series of fragments and that discrimination of AD from control is dependent on the subset of tau species measured. These assays provide novel tools to investigate CSF tau and ptau as biomarkers for other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we first designed and synthesized curcumin-based near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging probes for detecting both soluble and insoluble amyloid beta (Abeta) species and then an inhibitor that could attenuate cross-linking of Abeta induced by copper. According to our previous results and the possible structural stereohindrance compatibility of the Abeta peptide and the hydrophobic/hydrophilic property of the Abeta13-20 (HHQKLVFF) fragment, NIR imaging probe CRANAD-58 was designed and synthesized. As expected CRANAD-58 showed significant fluorescence property changes upon mixing with both soluble and insoluble Abeta species in vitro. In vivo NIR imaging revealed that CRANAD-58 was capable of differentiating transgenic and wild-type mice as young as 4 months old, the age that lacks apparently visible Abeta plaques and Abeta is likely in its soluble forms. According to our limited studies on the interaction mechanism between CRANAD-58 and Abeta, we also designed CRANAD-17 to attenuate the cross-linking of Abeta42 induced by copper. It is well-known that the coordination of copper with imidazoles on Histidine-13 and 14 (H13, H14) of Abeta peptides could initialize covalent cross-linking of Abeta. In CRANAD-17, a curcumin scaffold was used as an anchoring moiety to usher the designed compound to the vicinity of H13 and H14 of Abeta, and imidazole rings were incorporated to compete with H13/H14 for copper binding. The results of SDS-PAGE gel and Western blot indicated that CRANAD-17 was capable of inhibiting Abeta42 cross-linking induced by copper. This raises a potential for CRANAD-17 to be considered for AD therapy.",

    "abstract": "Inheritance of the apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) genotype has been identified as the major genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have shown that the binding between apoE and amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides occurs at residues 244-272 of apoE and residues 12-28 of Abeta. ApoE4 has been implicated in promoting Abeta deposition and impairing clearance of Abeta. We hypothesized that blocking the apoE/Abeta interaction would serve as an effective new approach to AD therapy. We have previously shown that treatment with Abeta12-28P can reduce amyloid plaques in APP/PS1 transgenic (Tg) mice and vascular amyloid in TgSwDI mice with congophilic amyloid angiopathy. In the present study, we investigated whether the Abeta12-28P elicits a therapeutic effect on tau-related pathology in addition to amyloid pathology using old triple transgenic AD mice (3xTg, with PS1M146V , APPSwe and tauP30IL transgenes) with established pathology from the ages of 21 to 26 months. We show that treatment with Abeta12-28P substantially reduces tau pathology both immunohistochemically and biochemically, as well as reducing the amyloid burden and suppressing the activation of astrocytes and microglia. These affects correlate with a behavioral amelioration in the treated Tg mice.",

While many hypotheses have been provided as to the cause of the disease, the exact mechanisms remain elusive and difficult to verify. Proteomic applications in disease models of AD have provided valuable insights into the molecular basis of this disorder, demonstrating that on a protein level, disease progression impacts numerous cellular processes such as energy production, cellular structure, signal transduction, synaptic function, mitochondrial function, cell cycle progression, and proteasome function. Each of these cellular functions contributes to the overall health of the cell, and the dysregulation of one or more could contribute to the pathology and clinical presentation in AD.

    "abstract": "The natural product curcumin has been shown to play a role in preventing Abeta amyloid fibril formation. This role could include chelation of transition metal ions such as Cu(2+), known to accelerate amyloid aggregation, and/or curcumin-binding directly to the Abeta protein. To investigate these different roles, curcumin complexation to Cu(2+) was investigated in the presence and absence of two different segments of the Abeta protein including the copper-binding (Abeta6-14) and curcumin-binding (Abeta14-23) domains. Absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy in 90% water/10% methanol solutions showed that curcumin can bind Cu(2+) to some extent in the presence of both segments despite strong peptide-ion interactions. Estimated Cu(2+)-curcumin binding affinities in the absence (1.6x10(5)M(-1)) and presence (7.9x10(4)M(-1)) of the peptide provide quantitative support for this Cu(2+) chelation role. With the Abeta14-23 segment, the curcumin simultaneously binds to Cu(2+) and the peptide, demonstrating that it can play multiple roles in the prevention of amyloid formation. The stabilities of ternary peptide-Cu(2+)-curcumin complexes were evaluated using ESI mass spectrometry and support the conclusion that curcumin can act as a weak metal ion chelator and also bind directly to the Abeta14-23 peptide segment.",

Using immunohistochemistry and brainwide microscopic analysis of 12-month-old tg-ArcSwe mice, we show that Abetax-40 plaque deposits are consistently present in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus and variably present in other regions. Using quantitative image analysis, we demonstrated that the average Abeta burden in the cortex and hippocampus is similar across animals, with coefficients of variance of 22% and 25%, respectively. This indicates that interventional studies of tg-ArcSwe mice are feasible using region-of-interest comparisons and that interventional trials require larger group sizes than commonly used.

Although A673T was observed independently in a Finnish population, this variant was absent in 8721 Asian subjects. The conflicting observations suggest that the contribution of A673T may be confined to Europeans and Americans rather than Asians. Nevertheless, A673T confers a protective function against AD and thus may be observed only in longevity subjects; thus it is not surprising to see its absence when the general populations or the patient cohorts were considered. To test whether the A673T contributes to the Chinese population, 1237 healthy longevity subjects (mean age 96.9 years) and 1404 matched younger controls (mean age 44.2 years) were genotyped for the variant. Our study failed to observe this variant in either the longevity subjects or the controls. Given the previous observation from Asians, our results suggest that the A673T variant is not involved in longevity in Chinese individuals; some other protective mechanisms may contribute to a lower incidence of AD in Chinese nonagenerians and centenarians.",

Although the complete loss of tPA was developmentally fatal to Tg2576 mice, tPA-heterozygous Tg2576 mice expressed the more severe degenerative phenotypes than tPA wild-type Tg2576 mice, including abnormal and unhealthy growth, shorter life spans, significantly enhanced Abeta levels, and the deposition of more and larger amyloid plaques in the brain. In addition, the expression of synaptic function-associated proteins was significantly reduced, which in turn caused a more severe impairment in learning and memory performance in Tg2576 mice.

    "abstract": "Amyloid cascades leading to peptide beta-sheet fibrils and plaques are central to many important diseases. Recently, intermediate assemblies of these cascades were identified as the toxic agents that interact with the cellular machinery. The relationship between the transformation from natively unstructured assembly to the beta-sheet oligomers to disease is important in understanding disease onset and the development of therapeutic agents. Research on this early oligomeric region has largely been unsuccessful since traditional techniques measure only ensemble average oligomer properties. Here, ion mobility methods are utilized to deduce the modulation of peptide self-assembly pathways in the amyloid-beta protein fragment Abeta(25-35) by two amyloid inhibitors (epigallocatechin gallate and scyllo-inositol) that are currently in clinical trials for Alzheimer's Disease. We provide evidence that suppression of beta-extended oligomers from the onset of the conversion into beta-oligomer conformations is essential for effective attenuation of beta-structured amyloid oligomeric species often associated with oligomer toxicity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ease with which ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry can guide the development of therapeutic agents and drug evaluation by providing molecular level insight into the amyloid formation process and its modulation by small molecule assembly modulators.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated longitudinal CSF biomarker measures collected when participants were cognitively normal to determine the magnitude and time course of biomarker changes before the onset of clinical symptoms in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Longitudinal CSF collection and cognitive assessments were performed on a cohort of 265 participants who were cognitively normal at their baseline assessment and subsequently developed MCI or dementia. CSF beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) were determined longitudinally. Consensus diagnoses were completed annually. Cox regression analyses were performed, with baseline CSF values and time-dependent rate of change in CSF values as covariates (adjusted by baseline age, race, and education), in relation to time to onset of mild cognitive symptoms. RESULTS: The mean time from baseline to onset of mild cognitive symptoms was 5.41 years. Increased risk of progressing from normal cognition to onset of clinical symptoms was associated with baseline values of Abeta1-42, p-tau, and the ratios of p-tau/Abeta1-42 and t-tau/Abeta1-42 (p < 0.002). Additionally, the rate of change in the ratios of t-tau/Abeta1-42 (p < 0.004) and p-tau/Abeta1-42 (p < 0.02) was greater among participants who were subsequently diagnosed with MCI. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline differences in CSF values were predictive of clinical symptoms that were a harbinger of a diagnosis of MCI more than 5 years before symptom onset, and continue to show longitudinal changes as cognitive symptoms develop, demonstrating that baseline and longitudinal changes in CSF biomarkers are evident during the preclinical phase of Alzheimer disease.",

METHODS: Cognitively normal (CN) participants in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who had 2 or more serial imaging assessments, which included amyloid PET, FDG-PET, and MRI at each time point, were eligible for analysis (n = 207). Twelve subjects with Alzheimer disease dementia were included for comparison. RESULTS: Of the 123 CN participants who were amyloid-negative at baseline, 26 met criteria for incident amyloid PET positivity. Compared to the 69 subjects who remained stable amyloid-negative, on average these 26 did not differ on any imaging, demographic, or cognitive variables except amyloid PET (by definition) and task-free functional connectivity, which at baseline was greater in the incident amyloid-positive group. Eleven of the 26 incident amyloid-positive subjects had abnormal hippocampal volume, FDG-PET, or both at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of amyloid PET positivity is approximately 13% per year among CN participants over age 70 sampled from a population-based cohort. In 15/26 (58%), incident amyloid positivity occurred prior to abnormalities in FDG-PET and hippocampal volume. However, 11/26 (42%) incident amyloid-positive subjects had evidence of neurodegeneration prior to incident amyloid positivity. These 11 could be subjects with combinations of preexisting non-Alzheimer pathophysiologies and tau-mediated neurodegeneration who newly entered the amyloid pathway.

    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaOs) trigger neurotoxic signaling, at least partially, via the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)). However, it is unknown whether other ligands of PrP(C) can regulate this potentially toxic interaction. Stress-inducible phosphoprotein 1 (STI1), an Hsp90 cochaperone secreted by astrocytes, binds to PrP(C) in the vicinity of the AbetaO binding site to protect neurons against toxic stimuli. Here, we investigated a potential role of STI1 in AbetaO toxicity. We confirmed the specific binding of AbetaOs and STI1 to the PrP and showed that STI1 efficiently inhibited AbetaO binding to PrP in vitro (IC50 of ~70 nm) and also decreased AbetaO binding to cultured mouse primary hippocampal neurons. Treatment with STI1 prevented AbetaO-induced synaptic loss and neuronal death in mouse cultured neurons and long-term potentiation inhibition in mouse hippocampal slices. Interestingly, STI1-haploinsufficient neurons were more sensitive to AbetaO-induced cell death and could be rescued by treatment with recombinant STI1. Noteworthy, both AbetaO binding to PrP(C) and PrP(C)-dependent AbetaO toxicity were inhibited by TPR2A, the PrP(C)-interacting domain of STI1. Additionally, PrP(C)-STI1 engagement activated alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which participated in neuroprotection against AbetaO-induced toxicity. We found an age-dependent upregulation of cortical STI1 in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of AD and in the brains of AD-affected individuals, suggesting a compensatory response. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of the PrP(C) ligand STI1 in protecting neurons in AD and suggest a novel pathway that may help to offset AbetaO-induced toxicity.",

To this aim, the influence of the omega-3 lipid, 1,2-didocosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine [22:6(cis)PC] on the biophysical properties of lipid bilayers, and on their interaction with the amyloid peptide fragment Abeta(25-35) has been investigated by Electron Spin Resonance (ESR), using spin-labeled phospholipids. The results show that the peptide selectively interacts with bilayers enriched in cholesterol (Chol) and sphingomyelin (SM).

    "title": "Bizarre behaviors and risk assessment in 3xTg-AD mice at early stages of the disease.",
    "abstract": "Bizarre behaviors (stereotyped stretching, stereotyped rearing, backward movements and jumps) were conspicuously elicited in classical unconditioned tests with different levels of anxiogenic conditions. They were characterized for the first time as early-BPSD-like symptoms in 6 month-old male and female 3xTg-AD mice. The pattern of these behaviors differed from that exhibited by their age- and gender-matched NTg counterparts. Confrontation of an open and illuminated field was the best trigger of such behaviors as compared to mild neophobia in the corner test or the choice between two compartments in the dark-light box. Here we also report that increased freezing, delayed thigmotaxis and enhancement of emotional behaviors were early BPSD-like symptoms indicative of their response to low-stressful environments. Independently of the genotype, consistent gender effects pointed toward the relevance of female gender to study bizarre behaviors and risk assessment. The identification of items of behavior and its gender component were relevant to find out bidirectional and selective behavioral long-lasting effects of postnatal handling. This early life treatment reduced freezing and most of the bizarre behaviors whereas potentiated risk assessment and the horizontal locomotor activity. In contrast, vertical exploratory activity was not modified by the treatment. The results also talk in favor of the beneficence of early-life interventions on the behavioral outcome in adulthood in both healthy and disease conditions. As shown, the consideration of bizarre behaviors and risk assessment may become an additional tool for evaluating BPSD-like symptoms in relation to preventive and/or therapeutical strategies targeted at AD. It may also have a role in the evaluation of the potential risk factors for the disease.",

    "abstract": "The canonical pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease links the expression of apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele (ApoE) to amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and Abeta peptide accumulation by a set of mechanisms that is incompletely defined. The development of a simple system that focuses not on a single variable but on multiple factors and pathways would be valuable both for dissecting the underlying mechanisms and for identifying candidate therapeutics. Here we show that, although both ApoE3 and ApoE4 associate with APP with nanomolar affinities, only ApoE4 significantly (i) reduces the ratio of soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPPalpha) to Abeta; (ii) reduces Sirtuin T1 (SirT1) expression, resulting in markedly differing ratios of neuroprotective SirT1 to neurotoxic SirT2; (iii) triggers Tau phosphorylation and APP phosphorylation; and (iv) induces programmed cell death. We describe a subset of drug candidates that interferes with the APP-ApoE interaction and returns the parameters noted above to normal. Our data support the hypothesis that neuronal connectivity, as reflected in the ratios of critical mediators such as sAPPalpha:Abeta, SirT1:SirT2, APP:phosphorylated (p)-APP, and Tau:p-Tau, is programmatically altered by ApoE4 and offer a simple system for the identification of program mediators and therapeutic candidates.",

    "title": "Inhibition of amyloid-beta production by anti-amyloid precursor protein antibodies in primary mouse cortical neurones.",
    "abstract": "Current therapies for Alzheimer's disease only treat the symptoms of the disease. We have previously developed a novel monoclonal antibody, 2B3, which binds to the beta-secretase cleavage site in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and reduces the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in human cell lines. To determine whether the antibody was likely to be effective in mouse models of amyloid pathology in vivo, we investigated whether 2B3 could also bind to APP in mouse primary cortical neurones. Primary cortical neurones were produced from E15.5-17.5 C57Bl/6 wild-type and transgenic APP/V717I (London mutation) embryos. The percentage of the neuronal population was determined by immunocytochemistry. Cells were treated with 10 mug/ml 2B3 or an irrelevant IgG for 48 h and Abeta40 levels determined by ELISA. The population of cells was found to contain over 75% neurones and 2B3 bound effectively to these cells. No differences in Abeta40 were detected between wild-type and transgenic cells. Importantly, 2B3 significantly inhibited the production of Abeta40 by 75.15+-1.37% of the media control, whereas an irrelevant IgG only significantly reduced Abeta40 levels by 23.35+-5.55% of the media control. The reduction in Abeta40 produced by 2B3 was significantly greater than that caused by the IgG. These data indicate that 2B3 binds to APP in mouse neurones and can inhibit Abeta40, similar to our previous findings. The antibody is probably therefore acting by steric hindrance of beta-secretase and these data suggest that it will be effective in mice in vivo and could be an alternative potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Modification of the relationship of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele to the risk of Alzheimer disease and neurofibrillary tangle density by sleep.",
    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The apolipoprotein E (APOE [GenBank, 348; OMIM, 107741]) epsilon4 allele is a common and well-established genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD). Sleep consolidation is also associated with AD risk, and previous work suggests that APOE genotype and sleep may interact to influence cognitive function. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether better sleep consolidation attenuates the relationship of the APOE genotype to the risk of incident AD and the burden of AD pathology. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective longitudinal cohort study with up to 6 years of follow-up was conducted. Participants included 698 community-dwelling older adults without dementia (mean age, 81.7 years; 77% women) in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. EXPOSURES: We used up to 10 days of actigraphic recording to quantify the degree of sleep consolidation and ascertained APOE genotype. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants underwent annual evaluation for AD during a follow-up period of up to 6 years. Autopsies were performed on 201 participants who died, and beta-amyloid (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles were identified by immunohistochemistry and quantified. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 98 individuals developed AD. In a series of Cox proportional hazards regression models, better sleep consolidation attenuated the effect of the epsilon4 allele on the risk of incident AD (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.97; P = .04 per allele per 1-SD increase in sleep consolidation). In a series of linear mixed-effect models, better sleep consolidation also attenuated the effect of the epsilon4 allele on the annual rate of cognitive decline. In individuals who died, better sleep consolidation attenuated the effect of the epsilon4 allele on neurofibrillary tangle density (interaction estimate, -0.42; SE = 0.17; P = .02), which accounted for the effect of sleep consolidation on the association between APOE genotype and cognition proximate to death. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Better sleep consolidation attenuates the effect of APOE genotype on incident AD and development of neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Assessment of sleep consolidation may identify APOE+ individuals at high risk for incident AD, and interventions to enhance sleep consolidation should be studied as potentially useful means to reduce the risk of AD and development of neurofibrillary tangles in APOE epsilon4+ individuals.",

Polymeric form of prion protein (PrP), PrP(Sc), is implicated in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Recently, it was shown that the monomeric cellular form of PrP (PrP(C)), located on the neuron surface, binds Abeta oligomers (and possibly other beta-rich conformers) via the PrP(23-27) and PrP(90-110) segments, acting as Abeta receptor. On the other hand, PrP(Sc) polymers efficiently bind to Abeta monomers and accelerate their oligomerization. To identify specific PrP sequences that are essential for the interaction between PrP polymers and Abeta peptide, we have co-expressed Abeta and PrP (or its shortened derivatives), fused to different fluorophores, in the yeast cell. Our data show that the 90-110 and 28-89 regions of PrP control the binding of proteinase-resistant PrP polymers to the Abeta peptide, whereas the 23-27 segment of PrP is dispensable for this interaction. This indicates that the set of PrP fragments involved in the interaction with Abeta depends on PrP conformational state.",

    "abstract": "While accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposited as senile plaques is a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the neurotoxicity of these deposits remains controversial. Recent in vitro studies suggested a link between elevated Abeta and mitochondrial dysfunction that might contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. However, the in vivo evidence for mitochondria dysfunction caused by Abeta is still missing. Using intravital multiphoton imaging with a range of fluorescent markers, we systematically surveyed mitochondrial structural and functional changes in AD mouse models. We observed severe impairments to be limited to the vicinity of Abeta plaques, which included reduction of both numbers and membrane potential of mitochondria and the emergence of dystrophic and fragmented mitochondria. Both neuronal soma and neurites with oxidative stress show severe alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential in amyloid precursor protein mice. These results provide in vivo evidence revealing Abeta plaques as focal sources of toxicity that lead to severe structural and functional abnormalities in mitochondria. These alterations may contribute to neuronal network dysfunction and warrant further investigation as possible targets for therapeutic intervention in AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: N-terminally truncated, pyroglutamate-modified amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are major constituents of amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Using a newly developed ELISA for Abeta modified at glutamate 3 with a pyroglutamate (pE3Abeta), brain pE3Abeta was characterized in human AD in an AD mouse model harboring double knock-in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-KM670/671NL and presenilin 1 (PS1)-P264L (APP/PS1-dKI) mutations, and in a second mouse model with transgenic overexpression of human APP695 with APP-KM670/671NL (Tg2576). RESULTS: pE3Abeta increased in the AD brain versus age-matched controls, with pE3Abeta/total Abeta at 45 and 10%, respectively. Compared to controls, the AD brain demonstrated 8.5-fold increased pE3Abeta compared to non-pE3Abeta species, which increased 2.7-fold. In the APP/PS1-dKI brain, pE3Abeta/total Abeta increased from 7% at 3 months to 16 and 19% at 15 and 19 months, respectively. In Tg2576, pE3Abeta/total Abeta was only 1.5% at 19 months, suggesting that APP/PS1-dKI, despite less total Abeta compared to Tg2576 at comparable ages, more closely mimics AD brain pathology. CONCLUSION: This report supports a significant role for pE3Abeta in AD pathogenesis by confirming that pE3Abeta represents a large fraction of Abeta within the AD brain. Compared to the age-matched control brain, pE3Abeta increased to a greater extent compared to Abeta species without this N-terminal modification. Further, the APP/PS1-dKI model more closely resembles the AD brain in this regard, compared to the Tg2576 model.",

    "abstract": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which have been implicated in various neuroinflammatory responses, are thought to act in defense mechanisms by inhibiting neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we evaluated the effects of TLR2 on amyloid beta peptide 25-35 (Abeta25-35)-induced neuronal cell death, synaptic dysfunction, and microglial activation in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) from wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice and TLR2-knockout (KO) mice. In WT mice, Abeta25-35 induced beta-amyloid aggregation and surrounding TLR2 expression. And, propidium iodide (PI) uptake, which is a measure of cell death, increased in a dose-dependent manner in slices with Abeta25-35 treatment. In the Abeta25-35-treated TLR2-KO OHSCs, the PI uptake was significantly attenuated to the control level, indicating that the cells were less susceptible to Abeta25-35-induced neuronal toxicity. In the ultrastructural analysis, nuclear shrinkage, slightly swollen mitochondria, and degraded organelles were detected in the Abeta25-35-treated slices from WT mice but not in the Abeta25-35-treated slices from TLR2-KO, suggesting the resistance of TLR2-KO to Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity. In Abeta25-35-treated OHSCs of WT mice, the levels of phosphorylated tau were increased and the levels of synaptophysin were decreased in a dose-dependent manner, but they were not changed in OHSCs of TLR2-KO mice. In WT mice, Abeta25-35 increased total protein level and immunoreactivity of Iba-1, which was colocalized with TLR2. However, there were no significant changes in the slices of Abeta25-35-treated TLR2-KO mice. These results suggested that TLR2 may play a role in Abeta25-35-induced neuronal cell loss and synaptic dysfunction through the activation of microglia in OHSCs.",

    "abstract": "The fluorescence response of the Thioflavin-T (ThT) dye and derivatives has become the standard tool for detecting beta-amyloid aggregates (Abeta) in solution. However, it is accepted that ThT-based methods suffer from important drawbacks. Some of these are due to the cationic structure of ThT, which limits its application at slightly acidic conditions; whereas some limitations are related to the general use of an extrinsic-dye sensing strategy and its intrinsic requirement for the formation of a sensor-binding site during the aggregation process. Here, we introduce fluorescence-self-quenching (FSQ) between N-terminally tagged peptides as a strategy to overcome some of these limitations. Using a combination of steady-state, picosecond time-resolved fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy, we characterize the fluorescence response of HiLyte fluor 555-labelled Abeta peptides and demonstrate that Abeta self-assembly organizes the covalently attached probes in close proximity to trigger the self-quenching sensing process over a broad range of conditions. Importantly, we prove that N-terminal tagging of beta-amyloid peptides does not alter the self-assembly kinetics or the resulting aggregated structures. We also tested the ability of FSQ-based methods to monitor the inhibition of Abeta1-42 aggregation using the small heat-shock protein Hsp20 as a model system. Overall, FSQ-based strategies for amyloid-sensing fill the gap between current morphology-specific protocols using extrinsic dyes, and highly-specialized single-molecule techniques that are difficult to implement in high-throughput analytical determinations. When performed in Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) format, the method becomes a ratiometric platform to gain insights into amyloid structure and for standardizing in vitro studies of amyloid aggregation.",

Hippocampus and BFCS volumes were determined from structural magnetic resonance imaging scans at 3 Tesla, and cortical amyloid load from AV45 (florbetapir) positron emission tomography scans. In receiver operating characteristics analyses, BFCS volume provided significantly more accurate classification into amyloid-negative and -positive categories than hippocampus volume. In contrast, hippocampus volume more accurately identified the diagnostic categories of AD, late and early MCI, and CN compared with whole and anterior BFCS volume, whereas posterior BFCS and hippocampus volumes yielded similar diagnostic accuracy. In logistic regression analysis, hippocampus and posterior BFCS volumes contributed significantly to discriminate MCI and AD from CN, but only BFCS volume predicted amyloid status. Our findings suggest that BFCS atrophy is more closely associated with cortical amyloid burden than hippocampus atrophy in predementia AD.",

    "abstract": "High amyloid has been associated with substantial episodic memory decline over 18 and 36 months in healthy older adults and individuals with mild cognitive impairment. However, the nature and magnitude of amyloid-related memory and non-memory change from the preclinical to the clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease has not been evaluated over the same time interval. Healthy older adults (n = 320), individuals with mild cognitive impairment (n = 57) and individuals with Alzheimer's disease (n = 36) enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study underwent at least one positron emission tomography neuroimaging scan for amyloid. Cognitive assessments were conducted at baseline, and 18- and 36-month follow-up assessments. Compared with amyloid-negative healthy older adults, amyloid-positive healthy older adults, and amyloid-positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease showed moderate and equivalent decline in verbal and visual episodic memory over 36 months (d's = 0.47-0.51). Relative to amyloid-negative healthy older adults, amyloid-positive healthy older adults showed no decline in non-memory functions, but amyloid-positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment showed additional moderate decline in language, attention and visuospatial function (d's = 0.47-1.12), and amyloid-positive individuals with Alzheimer's disease showed large decline in all aspects of memory and non-memory function (d's = 0.73-2.28). Amyloid negative individuals with mild cognitive impairment did not show any cognitive decline over 36 months. When non-demented individuals (i.e. healthy older adults and adults with mild cognitive impairment) were further dichotomized, high amyloid-positive non-demented individuals showed a greater rate of decline in episodic memory and language when compared with low amyloid positive non-demented individuals. Memory decline does not plateau with increasing disease severity, and decline in non-memory functions increases in amyloid-positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. The combined detection of amyloid positivity and objectively-defined decline in memory are reliable indicators of early Alzheimer's disease, and the detection of decline in non-memory functions in amyloid-positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment may assist in determining the level of disease severity in these individuals. Further, these results suggest that grouping amyloid data into at least two categories of abnormality may be useful in determining the disease risk level in non-demented individuals.",

    "abstract": "Although Alzheimer's disease (AD) is usually sporadic, in a small proportion of cases it is familial and can be linked to mutations in beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Unlike the other genetic defects, the mutation [alanine-673 valine-673] (A673V) causes the disease only in the homozygous condition with enhanced amyloid beta (Abeta) production and aggregation; heterozygous carriers remain unaffected. It is not clear how misfolding and aggregation of Abeta is affected in vivo by this mutation and whether this correlates with its toxic effects. No animal models over-expressing the A673V-APP gene or alanine-2-valine (A2V) mutated human Abeta protein are currently available. Using the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans, we generated the first transgenic animal model to express the human Abeta1-40 wild-type (WT) in neurons or possess the A2V mutation (Abeta1-40A2V). Insertion of an Abeta-mutated gene into this nematode reproduced the homozygous state of the human pathology. Functional and biochemical characteristics found in the A2V strain were compared to those of transgenic C. elegans expressing Abeta1-40WT. The expression of both WT and A2V Abeta1-40 specifically reduced the nematode's lifespan, causing behavioral defects and neurotransmission impairment which were worse in A2V worms. Mutant animals were more resistant than WT to paralysis induced by the cholinergic agonist levamisole, indicating that the locomotor defect was specifically linked to postsynaptic dysfunctions. The toxicity caused by the mutated protein was associated with a high propensity to form oligomeric assemblies which accumulate in the neurons, suggesting this to be the central event involved in the postsynaptic damage and early onset of the disease in homozygous human A673V carriers.",

High Abeta deposition was associated significantly with a lower Mini-Mental State Examination score (<27 points, p = 0.04), high systolic blood pressure (p = 0.04), carrying the apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele (p < 0.01), and lower plasma ApoE levels (p = 0.02), and variation in the ABCA7 (p = 0.02) and EPHA1 genes (p = 0.02). Cholesterol measures were not related to Abeta deposition in this cohort of nondemented elderly adults.

We examined the extent to which the hallmark pathologies of Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body disease, and cerebrovascular diseases account for the association of age and APOE with decline in episodic memory versus nonepisodic cognitive abilities. Up to 20 waves of longitudinal cognitive data were collected from 858 autopsied participants in 2 ongoing clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging. Neuropathologic examinations quantified measures of beta amyloid (Abeta) plaque, mesial temporal and neocortical neurofibrillary tangles, macro- and microinfarcts, and neocortical Lewy bodies. Random coefficient models estimated person-specific slopes of decline in episodic memory and nonepisodic cognition. Path analysis examined the relation of age, APOE, and the 6 pathologic indices to the slopes of cognitive decline. The effect of age on decline in episodic memory was mediated by Abeta, mesial temporal and neocortical tau tangles, and macroscopic infarcts; age on decline in nonepisodic cognition was mediated by Abeta, neocortical tangles, and macroscopic infarcts. The effect of APOE on decline in episodic memory was mediated by Abeta, mesial temporal and neocortical tangles, and neocortical Lewy bodies; APOE on nonepisodic cognition was mediated by Abeta, neocortical tangles, and neocortical Lewy bodies.

    "abstract": "Many degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's involve proteins that have a tendency to misfold and aggregate eventually forming amyloid fibers. This review describes the use of monolayers, bilayers, supported membranes, and vesicles as model systems that have helped elucidate the mechanisms and consequences of the interactions between amyloidogenic proteins and membranes. These are twofold: membranes favor the formation of amyloid structures and these induce damage in those membranes. We describe studies that show how interfaces, especially charged ones, favor amyloidogenic protein aggregation by several means. First, surfaces increase the effective protein concentration reducing a three-dimensional system to a two-dimensional one. Second, charged surfaces allow electrostatic interactions with the protein. Anionic lipids as well as rafts, rich in cholesterol and gangliosides, prove to play an especially important role. Finally, these amphipathic systems also offer a hydrophobic environment favoring conformational changes, oligomerization, and eventual formation of mature fibers. In addition, we examine several models for membrane permeabilization: protein pores, leakage induced by extraction of lipids, chaotic pores, and membrane tension, presenting illustrative examples of experimental evidence in support of these models. The picture that emerges from recent work is one where more than one mechanism is in play. Which mechanism prevails depends on the protein, its aggregation state, and the lipid environment in which the interactions occur.",

In this study, we measured RPH3A and its ligand Rab3A as well as several SNARE proteins in postmortem neocortex of patients with AD, and found specific reductions of RPH3A immunoreactivity compared with aged controls. RPH3A loss correlated with dementia severity, cholinergic deafferentation, and increased beta-amyloid (Abeta) concentrations. Furthermore, RPH3A expression is selectively downregulated in cultured neurons treated with Abeta25-35 peptides.

    "title": "Dual-tagged amyloid-beta precursor protein reveals distinct transport pathways of its N- and C-terminal fragments.",
    "abstract": "The amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), a type I transmembrane protein genetically associated with Alzheimer's disease, has a complex biology that includes proteolytic processing into potentially toxic fragments, extensive trafficking and multiple, yet poorly-defined functions. We recently proposed that a significant fraction of APP is proteolytically cleaved in the neuronal soma into N- and C-terminal fragments (NTFs and CTFs), which then target independently of each other to separate destinations in the cell. Here, we prove this concept with live imaging and immunolocalization of two dual, N- and C-termini-tagged APP constructs: CFP-APP-YFP [containing the fluorescent tags, cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)] and FLAG-APP-Myc. When expressed at low levels in neuronal cells, these constructs are processed into differently tagged NTFs and CTFs that reveal distinct distributions and characteristics of transport. Like the endogenous N- and C-terminal epitopes of APP, the FLAG-tagged NTFs are present in trains of vesicles and tubules that localize to short filaments, which often immunostain for acetylated tubulin, whereas the Myc-tagged CTFs are detected on randomly distributed vesicle-like structures. The experimental treatments that selectively destabilize the acetylated microtubules abrogate the distribution of NTFs along filaments, without altering the random distribution of CTFs. These results indicate that the NTFs and CTFs are recruited to distinct transport pathways and reach separate destinations in neurons, where they likely accomplish functions independent of the parental, full-length APP. They also point to a compartment associated with acetylated microtubules in the neuronal soma--not the neurite terminals--as a major site of APP cleavage, and segregation of NTFs from CTFs.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) that is assumed to result from impaired elimination of this neurotoxic peptide. Most patients with AD also exhibit cerebral amyloid angiopathy, which consists of Abeta deposition within the cerebral vasculature. The contribution of monocytes in AD has so far been limited to macrophage precursors. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether circulating monocytes could play a role in the elimination of Abeta. With live intravital two-photon microscopy, we demonstrate that patrolling monocytes are attracted to and crawl onto the luminal walls of Abeta-positive veins, but not on Abeta-positive arteries or Abeta-free blood vessels. Additionally, we report the presence of crawling monocytes carrying Abeta in veins and their ability to circulate back into the bloodstream. Selective removal of Ly6C(lo) monocytes in APP/PS1 mice induced a significant increase of Abeta load in the cortex and hippocampus. These data uncover the ability of Ly6C(lo) monocytes to naturally target and eliminate Abeta within the lumen of veins and constitute a potential therapeutic target in AD.",

    "title": "Wild type and mutant amyloid precursor proteins influence downstream effects of proteasome and autophagy inhibition.",
    "abstract": "Cells rely on complementary proteolytic pathways including the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy to maintain proper protein degradation. There is known to be considerable interplay between them, whereby the loss of one clearance system results in compensatory changes in other proteolytic pathways of the cell. Disturbances in proteolysis are known to occur in Alzheimer's disease, and potentially contribute to neurophysiological and neurodegenerative processes. Currently, few data are available on how the presence of wild type and mutant amyloid precursor protein (APPwt and APPmut) potentially alters the reciprocal interplay between the different intracellular proteolytic pathways. This study used human SH-SY5Y neuronal cell lines, and SH-SY5Y transfected with either APPwt or APPmut (valine-to-glycine substitution at position 717), in order to explore if the presence of APPwt or APPmut altered the downstream effects of pharmacological proteasome or autophagy inhibition. The occurrence of APPwt or APPmut was observed to disturb proteasome or autophagy activities upon treatment with proteasome inhibitors or authophagy inhibitors. Interestingly, APPwt and APPmut expression was observed to significantly and robustly enhance the induction in cathepsin B following the administration of an established proteasome inhibitor. The presence of APPwt and APPmut also significantly reduced the elevation in ubiquitinated proteins following proteasome inhibitor treatments. Our data strongly suggest that APP is able to affect the downstream effects of protease inhibition in neural cells including enhancement of cathepsin B activity, with these changes in cathepsin B significantly and inversely related to the levels of ubiquitinated protein.",

We demonstrated that baicalin can inhibit beta amyloid peptides (Abeta42)-induced BV2 microglial cell proliferation, reduce the expression of CD11b, decrease chemotactic ability of BV2 cells and significantly inhibit the secretion of IL-6, TNF-alpha and NO. Moreover, baicalin pretreatment can effectively inhibit Abeta-induced phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3.

Understanding how these aggregates are formed, secreted and propagated by neurons has been the subject of intensive research, but so far no preventive or curative therapy for AD is available, and clinical trials have been largely unsuccessful. Here we show that deficiency of the lysosomal sialidase NEU1 leads to the spontaneous occurrence of an AD-like amyloidogenic process in mice. This involves two consecutive events linked to NEU1 loss-of-function--accumulation and amyloidogenic processing of an oversialylated amyloid precursor protein in lysosomes, and extracellular release of Abeta peptides by excessive lysosomal exocytosis. Furthermore, cerebral injection of NEU1 in an established AD mouse model substantially reduces beta-amyloid plaques. Our findings identify an additional pathway for the secretion of Abeta and define NEU1 as a potential therapeutic molecule for AD.",

    "abstract": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is pathologically characterized by alpha-synuclein aggregates in the brain. Most patients with DLB also show cerebral Alzheimer disease-type pathology (i.e. beta-amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau deposits). It is unclear whether this overlap is coincidental or driven by specific regional or cellular interactions. The aims of this study were to investigate the regional convergence of alpha-synuclein, tau, and beta-amyloid and to identify patterns of cellular co-occurrence of tau and alpha-synuclein in DLB. The study group consisted of 22 patients who met clinical and neuropathologic criteria for DLB. Protein aggregates were assessed semiquantitatively in 17 brain areas. APOE and MAPT genotypes were determined. Cellular co-occurrence of tau and alpha-synuclein was evaluated by double immunofluorescence. We found that total beta-amyloid pathology scores correlated positively with total alpha-synuclein pathology scores (rho = 0.692, p = 0.001). The factors that correlated best with the amount of alpha-synuclein pathology were the severity of beta-amyloid pathology and presence of the MAPT H1 haplotype. Tau and alpha-synuclein frequently colocalized in limbic areas, but no correlation between total pathology scores was observed. This study confirms and extends the role of beta-amyloid deposition and the MAPT H1 haplotype as contributing factors in DLB pathogenesis and demonstrates the confluence of multiple agents in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that Alzheimer disease (AD) is a clinical and pathologic continuum between normal aging and end-stage dementia, we selected a convenience sample of subjects from the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center 2005 to 2012 autopsy cohort (n = 2,083) with the last clinical evaluation within 2 years before autopsy and no other primary neuropathologic diagnosis. Demographic and neuropathologic characteristics were correlated with the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes in the 835 subjects meeting these criteria. Both neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles independently predicted Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes. Severe small-vessel disease, severe amyloid angiopathy, and hippocampal sclerosis were also independently associated with the degree of cognitive impairment. By contrast, education was a strong independent protective factor against cognitive deficits. The cause of mild to moderate dementia remained uncertain in 14% of the patients. Inverse probability weighting suggests the generalizability of these results to nonautopsied cohorts. These data indicate that plaques and tangles independently contribute to cognitive impairment, that concurrent vascular disease strongly correlates with cognitive dysfunction even in a sample selected to represent the AD pathologic continuum, and that education further modifies clinical expression. Thus, multiple concomitant etiologies of brain damage and premorbid characteristics contribute to the uncertainty of AD clinicopathologic correlations based only on tangles and plaques.",

Prior reports have suggested that paravascular bulk flow of CSF or ISF may be driven by arterial pulsation. However, cerebral arterial pulsation could not be directly assessed. In the present study, we use in vivo two-photon microscopy in mice to visualize vascular wall pulsatility in penetrating intracortical arteries. We observed that unilateral ligation of the internal carotid artery significantly reduced arterial pulsatility by ~50%, while systemic administration of the adrenergic agonist dobutamine increased pulsatility of penetrating arteries by ~60%. When paravascular CSF-ISF exchange was evaluated in real time using in vivo two-photon and ex vivo fluorescence imaging, we observed that internal carotid artery ligation slowed the rate of paravascular CSF-ISF exchange, while dobutamine increased the rate of paravascular CSF-ISF exchange. These findings demonstrate that cerebral arterial pulsatility is a key driver of paravascular CSF influx into and through the brain parenchyma, and suggest that changes in arterial pulsatility may contribute to accumulation and deposition of toxic solutes, including amyloid beta, in the aging brain.",

METHODS: We developed a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic AD transgenic mouse model and evaluated the effect of hyperglycemia on senile plaque formation. RESULTS: Our data showed that administration of STZ increased the level of blood glucose and increased the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in brain tissue, and further enhanced the expression levels of the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) and the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) in the brain, and accelerated the senile plaque formation in the transgenic mice. Our results showed that STZ-induced insulin-deficient hyperglycemia caused the pathophysiology of AD in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by modulating the AGEs/RAGE/NF-kappaB pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that there is a close linkage of DM and cerebral amyloidosis in the pathogenesis of AD.",

    "abstract": "Deposition of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accumulation of Abeta is thought to associate with cognition deficits, neuroinflammation and apoptosis observed in AD. However, effective neuroprotective approaches against Abeta neurotoxicity are unavailable. In the present study, we analysed the effects of pranlukast, a selective cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1R) antagonist, on the impairment of learning and memory formation induced by Abeta and the probable underlying electrophysiological and molecular mechanisms. We found that bilateral intrahippocampal injection of Abeta1-42 resulted in a significant decline of spatial learning and memory of mice in the Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests, together with a serious depression of in vivo hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the mice. Importantly, this treatment caused significant increases in CysLT1R expression and subsequent NF-kappaB signaling, caspase-3 activation and Bcl-2 downregulation in the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex. Oral administration of pranlukast at 0.4 or 0.8 mg/kg for 4 wk significantly reversed Abeta1-42-induced impairments of cognitive function and hippocampal LTP in mice. Furthermore, pranlukast reversed Abeta1-42-induced CysLT1R upregulation, and markedly suppressed the Abeta1-42-triggered NF-kappaB pathway, caspase-3 activation and Bcl-2 downregulation in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in mice. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay confirmed its presence in the brain after oral administration of pranlukast in mice. These data disclose novel findings about the therapeutic potential of pranlukast, revealing a previously unknown therapeutic possibility to treat memory deficits associated with AD.",

    "abstract": "The Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model Tg2576 overexpresses an AD associated mutant variant of human APP and accumulates amyloid beta (Abeta) in an age-dependent manner. Using the selective cholinergic immunotoxin mu p75-saporin (SAP), we induced a partial basal forebrain cholinergic degeneration (BFCD) in 3 months old male Tg2576 mice to co-express cholinergic degeneration with Abeta overexpression as these characteristics constitutes key hallmarks of AD. At 9 months, SAP lesioned Tg2576 mice were cognitively impaired in two spatial paradigms addressing working memory and mid to long-term memory. Conversely, there was no deterioration of cognitive functioning in sham lesioned Tg2576 mice or wild type littermates (wt) receiving the immunotoxin. At 10 months of age, release of acetylcholine (ACh) was addressed by microdialysis in conscious mice. Scopolamine-induced increases in hippocampal ACh efflux was significantly reduced in SAP lesioned Tg2576 mice compared to sham lesioned Tg2576 mice. Intriguingly, there was no significant difference in ACh efflux between wt treatment groups. Following SAP treatment, choline acetyltransferase activity was reduced in the hippocampus and frontal cortex and the reduction was comparable between groups. Our results suggest that partial BFCD acts collectively with increased levels of Abeta to induce cognitive decline and to compromise cholinergic release. Tg2576 mice with BFCD may constitute a new and suitable AD mouse model to study the interrelations between cholinergic deficits and amsyloid deposition.",

METHODS: We sequenced the genomes of 102 individuals from Antioquia, Colombia. We applied identity-by-descent analysis to identify regions of common ancestry. We estimated the age of the E280A mutation and the local ancestry of the haplotype harboring this mutation. RESULTS: All affected individuals share a minimal haplotype of 1.8 Mb containing E280A. We estimate a time to most recent common ancestor of E280A of 10 (95% credible interval, 7.2-12.6) generations. We date the de novo mutation event to 15 (95% credible interval, 11-25) generations ago. We infer a western European geographic origin of the shared haplotype. CONCLUSIONS: The age and geographic origin of E280A are consistent with a single founder dating from the time of the Spanish Conquistadors who began colonizing Colombia during the early 16th century.",

METHODS: BACE1 activity and protein concentrations were measured and analyzed in 342 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, including 99 normal control, 75 stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 87 progressive MCI, and 79 AD dementia cases. All statistical analyses were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: No significant differences between controls and any of the three patient groups were detected for BACE1 activity and soluble APPbeta (sAPPbeta) concentrations in CSF. Significant correlations with BACE1 activity were found for CSF APPbeta and total tau in all four groups and for CSF phosphorylated tau181 in all groups but the progressive MCI group. There were no correlations for CSF amyloid beta (Abeta)1-42 or for plasma Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40. CONCLUSIONS: The consistent correlation between BACE1 activity and sAPPbeta supports their role as biomarkers of target engagement in clinical trials on BACE1 inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Pro-inflammatory S100A9 protein is increasingly recognized as an important contributor to inflammation-related neurodegeneration. Here, we provide insights into S100A9 specific mechanisms of action in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Due to its inherent amyloidogenicity S100A9 contributes to amyloid plaque formation together with Abeta. In traumatic brain injury (TBI) S100A9 itself rapidly forms amyloid plaques, which were reactive with oligomer-specific antibodies, but not with Abeta and amyloid fibrillar antibodies. They may serve as precursor-plaques for AD, implicating TBI as an AD risk factor. S100A9 was observed in some hippocampal and cortical neurons in TBI, AD and non-demented aging. In vitro S100A9 forms neurotoxic linear and annular amyloids resembling Abeta protofilaments. S100A9 amyloid cytotoxicity and native S100A9 pro-inflammatory signaling can be mitigated by its co-aggregation with Abeta, which results in a variety of micron-scale amyloid complexes. NMR and molecular docking demonstrated transient interactions between native S100A9 and Abeta. Thus, abundantly present in AD brain pro-inflammatory S100A9, possessing also intrinsic amyloidogenic properties and ability to modulate Abeta aggregation, can serve as a link between the AD amyloid and neuroinflammatory cascades and as a prospective therapeutic target.",

In this study we synthesized a series of truncated derivatives of the oligosaccharide, and investigated the effect of these derivatives against Abeta peptide toxicity in vitro. METHODS: The sulfoxide method was applied to synthesize the derivatives. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were treated with Abeta1-40 (2 mumol/L), and the cell viability was detected using a CCK8 assay. RESULTS: A series of beta-(1,4)-D-mannosyl oligosaccharide, ranging from the disaccharide to the hexasaccharide, were synthesized. Addition of 10 mumol/L beta-(1,4)-D-mannobiose 6, beta-(1,4)-D-mannotriose 9 or beta-(1,4)-D-mannotetraose 12 in SH-SY5Y cells significantly attenuated Abeta1-40-induced toxicity. The efficacies were similar to those caused by 10 mumol/L oligomannurarate 971 or alzhemed. Other oligosaccharides including oligomaltoses and oligocelluloses were less active.

The determination of the kinetics of the individual association and dissociation reactions is hampered by the fact that forward and reverse reactions to/from different aggregation states occur simultaneously. Here, we report the kinetics of dissociation of Abeta monomers from protofibrils, prefibrillar high molecular weight oligomers previously shown to possess pronounced neurotoxicity. An engineered binding protein sequestering specifically monomeric Abeta was employed to follow protofibril dissociation by tryptophan fluorescence, precluding confounding effects of reverse or competing reactions. Abeta protofibril dissociation into monomers follows exponential decay kinetics with a time constant of ~2 h at 25  C and an activation energy of 80 kJ/mol, values typical for high affinity biomolecular interactions. This study demonstrates the high kinetic stability of Abeta protofibrils toward dissociation into monomers and supports the delineation of the Abeta folding and assembly energy landscape.",

In the current study, APP acted, via its alpha-cleavage, as a positive regulator of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP2) signaling in human astrocytic cells (U251MG), hepatic cells (HepG2), and primary fibroblasts, leading to an approximate 30% increase in SRE-dependent gene expression and, consequently, enhanced cholesterol biosynthesis and LDL receptor levels. This effect was mediated via the secretory ectodomain APPsalpha. The beta-cleaved ectodomain, in turn, repressed SRE-dependent gene expression by up to ~ 30%. This resulted in decreased cholesterol synthesis and LDL receptor content, establishing a physiological feedback loop in cholesterol-loaded cells, where APP undergoes preferential beta-cleavage. Patients with familial Alzheimer's disease had decreased circulating lathosterol, reflecting hepatic cholesterol synthesis, and their fibroblasts had reduced LDL receptor content, which was alleviated by decreasing beta-cleavage. These results show that APP regulates cholesterol metabolism in cells relevant for whole-body cholesterol balance and reveal that APP alpha- and beta-cleavages produce opposing paracrine regulators of SREBP2 signaling.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Flagship Study of Ageing is a prospective study of 1,112 individuals (211 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 133 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 768 healthy controls (HCs)). Here we report diagnostic and cognitive findings at the first (18-month) follow-up of the cohort. The first aim was to compute rates of transition from HC to MCI, and MCI to AD. The second aim was to characterize the cognitive profiles of individuals who transitioned to a more severe disease stage compared with those who did not. METHODS: Eighteen months after baseline, participants underwent comprehensive cognitive testing and diagnostic review, provided an 80 ml blood sample, and completed health and lifestyle questionnaires. A subgroup also underwent amyloid PET and MRI neuroimaging. RESULTS: The diagnostic status of 89.9% of the cohorts was determined (972 were reassessed, 28 had died, and 112 did not return for reassessment). The 18-month cohort comprised 692 HCs, 82 MCI cases, 197 AD patients, and one Parkinson's disease dementia case. The transition rate from HC to MCI was 2.5%, and cognitive decline in HCs who transitioned to MCI was greatest in memory and naming domains compared to HCs who remained stable. The transition rate from MCI to AD was 30.5%. CONCLUSION: There was a high retention rate after 18 months. Rates of transition from healthy aging to MCI, and MCI to AD, were consistent with established estimates. Follow-up of this cohort over longer periods will elucidate robust predictors of future cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Inheritance of the epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest genetic risk factor associated with the sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas the rare APOE epsilon2 allele has the opposite effect. However, the mechanisms whereby APOE confers risk and protection remain uncertain. We used a gene transfer approach to bathe the cortex of amyloid plaque-bearing transgenic mice with virally expressed human APOE. We monitored amyloid-beta (Abeta) with multiphoton imaging, in vivo microdialysis, and postmortem array tomography to study the kinetics of human APOE-mediated changes in Abeta-related neurotoxicity in a mouse model of AD. We observed that human APOE4 increased the concentrations of oligomeric Abeta within the interstitial fluid and exacerbated plaque deposition; the converse occurred after exposure to human APOE2. Peri-plaque synapse loss and dystrophic neurites were also worsened by APOE4 or attenuated by APOE2. Egress of Abeta from the central nervous system (CNS) into the plasma was diminished by APOE3 and APOE4 compared to APOE2, in accord with isoform-specific retention of Abeta in the CNS. Overall, our data show a differential effect of human APOE isoforms on amyloid deposition and clearance in transgenic mice and, more importantly, on Abeta-mediated synaptotoxicity. These results suggest that the APOE genetic risk is mediated by Abeta, and that therapeutic approaches aimed at decreasing APOE4, or increasing APOE2, may be beneficial in AD.",

We examined how aging and Abeta deposition affect neural function during memory encoding of visual scenes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Thirty-six cognitively normal older people underwent fMRI scanning, and positron emission tomography with [(11)C] Pittsburgh compound B to measure fibrillar brain Abeta; 15 young subjects were studied with fMRI. Older adults without Abeta deposition showed reduced regional brain activation (compared with young subjects) with decreased task-independent functional connectivity between parahippocampal gyrus and prefrontal cortex. In this network, task-related connectivity was increased compared with young subjects, and the degree of connectivity was related to memory performance. In contrast, older individuals with Abeta deposition showed no such increased task-related network connectivity, but did display increased regional activity unassociated with performance. These findings suggest that network connectivity plays a significant role in compensating for reduced regional activity during successful memory encoding in aging without Abeta deposition, while in those with Abeta this network compensation fails and is accompanied by inefficient regional hyperactivation.",

Translocated SET to the cytoplasm can induce tau hyperphosphorylation. To elucidate the putative relationships between mislocalized APPcc and SET, we studied their level and distribution in the hippocampus of 5 controls, 3 Down syndrome and 10 Alzheimer patients. In Down syndrome and Alzheimer patients, APPcc and SET levels were increased in CA1 and the frequency of both localizations in the neuronal cytoplasm was high in CA1, and low in CA4. As the increase of APPcc is already present at early stages of AD, we overexpressed APPcc in CA1 and the dentate gyrus neurons of adult mice with a lentiviral construct. APPcc overexpression in CA1 and not in the dentate gyrus induced endogenous SET translocation and tau hyperphosphorylation. These data suggest that increase in APPcc in CA1 neurons could be an early event leading to the translocation of SET and the progression of AD through tau hyperphosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "The failure of adult hippocampal neurogenesis is increasingly considered as an important factor in the pathological correlates for memory decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Loss of adult-born neurons and abnormalities of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) within the dentate gyrus (DG) of adult hippocampus might contribute to this process. In this study, we showed that amyloid-beta(1-42) (Abeta42) oligomer triggers senescent phenotype of NSPCs in vitro. Oligomerized Abeta42 induced the production of senescence-associated biomarkers p16 and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) in adult mouse hippocampal NSPCs, as well as inhibited cells proliferation and differentiation. In the DG of amyloid precursor protein/presenilin1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice, the number of senescent NSPCs was significantly increased and senescence-associated protein p16 was upregulated. Formylpeptide receptor 2 (FPR2), one of Abeta42 functional receptors, may be involved in NSPCs senescence. The FPR2 antagonist WRW4 significantly inhibited NSPCs senescence induced by Abeta42. In addition, the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in response to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was involved in NSPCs senescence induced by Abeta42. WRW4 inhibited the accumulation of ROS and the activation of p38 MAPK in NSPCs. Our data suggest that Abeta42 accelerates NSPCs senescence via FPR2-dependent activation of its downstream ROS-p38 MAPK signaling, which limits the function of NSPCs and contributes to failure of neurogenesis. This is the first demonstration of NSPCs senescence response to Abeta42.",

Abeta-induced cell injury is a crucial cause of neuronal loss in AD, thus the suppression of which might be useful for the treatment of this disease. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of paeoniflorin (PF), a monoterpene glycoside isolated from aqueous extract of Radix Paeoniae Alba, on Abeta25-35-induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. The results showed PF could attenuate or restore the viability loss, apoptotic increase, and ROS production induced by Abeta25-35 in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, PF strikingly inhibited Abeta25-35-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, which includes decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, cytochrome c release and activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Therefore, our study provided the first experimental evidence that PF could modulate ROS production and apoptotic mitochondrial pathway in model of neuron injury in vitro and which might provide new insights into its application toward Alzheimer's disease therapy.",

In the present study, we transplanted NSCs from C57BL/6 mice into the hippocampus in the 12-month-old triple transgenic model of AD (3 x Tg) and determined whether NSC transplantation can alleviate impairments in spatial learning and memory via neuronal regeneration in AD mice. Two months after transplantation, Morris water maze tests suggested that spatial learning and memory in the 3 x Tg mice receiving NSCs was significantly improved compared to 3 x Tg mice not receiving NSCs. Furthermore, quantification of Nissl staining revealed that the number of neurons in the hippocampus of 3 x Tg mice receiving NSCs was significantly greater than that in 3 x Tg mice not receiving NSCs, indicating that new neurons were generated. These results may demonstrate that NSC transplantation can improve spatial learning and memory via neuronal regeneration in amyloid-beta precursor protein/presenilin 1/tau 3 x Tg mice.",

The present study using rat brain explores the mechanisms of insulin synthesis and secretion, as well as amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta(1-42))-induced reduction of proinsulin expression. After confirming the expression of insulin mRNA and proinsulin in rat brain, we visualized and analyzed the motion of insulin secretion in rat hippocampal neurons using pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein (pHluorin) fused to the insulin. In the rat hippocampal neurons expressing insulin-pHluorin, time-lapse confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed the appearance of fluorescent spots induced by depolarization after stimulation with 50 mM KCl. In these fluorescent spots, Ca(2+)-dependent activator protein for secretion 2 (CAPS2), which is the regulator of the dense-core vesicle involving neuronal peptides, was co-localized with insulin-pHluorin. However, Abeta(1-42)-induced reduction of proinsulin in rat hippocampal neurons was inhibited by treatment with lithium and transfection with glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) siRNA. These results demonstrate that synthesized insulin is secreted from rat hippocampal and cortical neuron's dense-core vesicles, and that activation of GSK-3beta in Abeta(1-42)-induced Alzheimer's model hippocampal neurons decreases the insulin synthesis.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that obesity has deleterious effects on the brain and cognitive function in the elderly population. However, the specific mechanisms through which aging and obesity interact to promote cognitive decline remain unclear. To test the hypothesis that aging exacerbates obesity-induced cerebromicrovascular damage and neuroinflammation, we compared young (7 months) and aged (24 months) high fat diet-fed obese C57BL/6 mice. Aging exacerbated obesity-induced systemic inflammation and blood-brain barrier disruption, as indicated by the increased circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased presence of extravasated immunoglobulin G in the hippocampus, respectively. Obesity-induced blood-brain barrier damage was associated with microglia activation, upregulation of activating Fc-gamma receptors and proinflammatory cytokines, and increased oxidative stress. Treatment of cultured primary microglia with sera derived from aged obese mice resulted in significantly more pronounced microglia activation and oxidative stress, as compared with treatment with young sera. Serum-induced activation and oxidative stress were also exacerbated in primary microglia derived from aged animals. Hippocampal expression of genes involved in regulation of the cellular amyloid precursor protein-dependent signaling pathways, beta-amyloid generation, and the pathogenesis of tauopathy were largely unaffected by obesity in aged mice. Collectively, obesity in aging is associated with a heightened state of systemic inflammation, which exacerbates blood-brain barrier disruption. The resulting neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the mouse hippocampus likely contribute to the significant cognitive decline observed in aged obese animals.",

    "abstract": "The gamma (gamma)-secretase holoenzyme is composed of four core proteins and cleaves APP to generate amyloid beta (Abeta), a key molecule that causes major neurotoxicity during the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, despite its important role in Abeta production, little is known about the regulation of gamma-secretase. OCIAD2, a novel modulator of gamma-secretase that stimulates Abeta production, and which was isolated from a genome-wide functional screen using cell-based assays and a cDNA library comprising 6,178 genes. Ectopic expression of OCIAD2 enhanced Abeta production, while reduction of OCIAD2 expression suppressed it. OCIAD2 expression facilitated the formation of an active gamma-secretase complex and enhanced subcellular localization of the enzyme components to lipid rafts. OCIAD2 interacted with nicastrin to stimulate gamma-secretase activity. OCIAD2 also increased the interaction of nicastrin with C99 and stimulated APP processing via gamma-secretase activation, but did not affect Notch processing. In addition, a cell-permeable Tat-OCIAD2 peptide that interfered with the interaction of OCIAD2 with nicastrin interrupted the gamma-secretase-mediated AICD production. Finally, OCIAD2 expression was significantly elevated in the brain of AD patients and PDAPP mice. This study identifies OCIAD2 as a selective activator of gamma-secretase to increase Abeta generation.",

    "abstract": "Naked mole rats (NMRs) are the longest-lived rodents, with young individuals having high levels of Abeta in their brains. The purpose of this study was twofold: to assess the distribution of Abeta in key regions of NMR brains (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum) and to understand whether the accumulation of Abeta is due to enhanced production or decreased degradation. Recent evidence indicates that lipid peroxides directly participate in induction of cytoprotective proteins, such as heat shock proteins (Hsps), which play a central role in the cellular mechanisms of stress tolerance. Amyloid precursor protein processing, lipid peroxidation, Hsps, redox status, and protein degradation processes were therefore assessed in key NMR brain regions. NMR brains had high levels of lipid peroxidation compared with mice, and the NMR hippocampus had the highest levels of the most toxic moiety of Abeta (soluble Abeta1 - 42 ). This was due not to increased Abeta production but rather to low antioxidant potential, which was associated with low induction of Hsp70 and heme oxygenase-1 as well as low ubiquitin-proteasome activity. NMRs may therefore serve as natural models for understanding the relationship between oxidative stress and Abeta levels and its effects on the brain.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence shows that metal coordination by amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) determines structural alterations of peptides, and His-13 from Abeta is crucial for Cu(2+) binding. This study used the truncated, more soluble Abeta1-16 isoforms derived from human and rat amyloid peptides to explore their interaction with Cu(2+) by employing the membrane-immobilized alpha-hemolysin (alpha-HL) protein as a nanoscopic probe in conjunction with single-molecule electrophysiology techniques. Unexpectedly, the experimental data suggest that unlike the case of the human Abeta1-16 peptide, Cu(2+) complexation by its rat counterpart leads to an augmented association and dissociation kinetics of the peptide reversible interaction with the protein pore, as compared to the Cu(2+)-free peptide. Single-molecule electrophysiology data reveal that both human and rat Cu(2+)-complexed Abeta peptides induce a higher degree of current flow obstruction through the alpha-HL pore, as compared to the Cu(2+)-free peptides. It is suggested that morphology changes brought by Cu(2+) binding to such amyloidic fragments depend crucially upon the presence of the His-13 residue on the primary sequence of such peptide fragments, and the alpha-HL protein-based approach provides unique opportunities and challenges to probing metal-induced folding of peptides.",

    "abstract": "Podoplanin (PDPN) is a mucin-like transmembrane glycoprotein that plays an important role in development and cancer. Here, we provide evidence that the intracellular domain (ICD) of podoplanin is released into the cytosol following a sequential proteolytic processing by a metalloprotease and gamma-secretase. Western blotting and cell fractionation studies revealed that HEK293T and MDCK cells transfected with an eGFP-tagged podoplanin construct (PDPNeGFP, 50-63kDa) constitutively express two C-terminal fragments (CTFs): a ~33kDa membrane-bound PCTF33, and a ~29kDa cytosolic podoplanin ICD (PICD). While pharmacological inhibition of metalloproteases reduced the expression of PCTF33, treatment of cells with gamma-secretase inhibitors resulted in enhanced PCTF33 levels. PCTF33 processing by gamma-secretase depends on presenilin-1 (PS1) function: cells expressing a dominant negative form of PS1 (PS1 D385N), and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) genetically deficient in PS1, but not in PS2, show higher levels of PCTF33 expression with respect to wild-type MEFs. Furthermore, transfection of PS1 deficient MEFs with wild-type PS1 (PS1 wt) decreased PCTF33 levels. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the affinity purified PICD revealed that the gamma-secretase cleavage site was located between valines 150 and 151, but these residues are not critical for proteolysis. We found that podoplanin CTFs are also generated in cells expressing podoplanin mutants harboring heterologous transmembrane regions. Taken together, these results indicate that podoplanin is a novel substrate for PS1/gamma-secretase.",

    "abstract": "We investigated on the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes involved in the cholinergic control of in vivo hippocampal glutamate (GLU), aspartate (ASP) and inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) overflow. We also investigated on the possible contribution of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors subtypes present on astrocytes in the regulation of the three neurotransmitter amino acids overflow using hippocampal gliosomes and on the effects of beta-amyloid (Abeta) 1-40 on the nicotinic control of amino acid neurotransmitter release. Nicotine was able to enhance the in vivo overflow of the three amino acids being more potent in stimulating GLU overflow. The alpha7 selective agonist PHA543613 induced an overflow very similar to that of nicotine. The alpha4beta2 selective agonist 5IA85380 was significantly less potent in inducing GLU overflow while the overflow of ASP and GABA were almost inconsistent. Abeta1-40 inhibited the neurotransmitter overflow stimulated by PHA543613 but not the one evoked by 5IA85380. In hippocampal gliosomes nicotine elicited selectively GLU overflow which was also evoked by 5IA85380 and by the alpha7 selective agonist choline. Nicotine- and choline-induced glutamate overflow in gliosomes was inhibited by Aalpha1-40. In conclusion nicotine administration in vivo elicits hippocampal GLU release mostly through alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors likely present both on neurons and astrocytes. Abeta inhibitory effect on the nicotinic-control of GLU release seems to depend primarily to the inhibition of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors functional responses.",

    "abstract": "Typical markers of protein aging are spontaneous post-translational modifications such as amino acid racemization (AAR) and amino acid isomerization (AAI) during the degradation of peptides. The post-translational AAR and AAI could significantly induce the density and localization of plaque deposition in brain tissues. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is reliably related to the formation and aggregation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) plaques in the human brain. No current analytical methods can simultaneously determine AAR and AAI during the degradation of Abeta from AD patients. We now report a covalent chiral derivatized ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (CCD-UPLC-MS/MS) method for the determination of post-translational AAR and AAI of N-terminal Abeta (N-Abeta1-5) in human brain tissues. When subjected to tryptic N-Abeta1-5 from post-translationally modified natural Abeta in focal brain tissues by the CCD procedure, it was monitored at m/z 989.6 637.0/678.9 during electrospray collision-induced dissociation. These N-Abeta1-5 fragments with l-aspartic acid (l-Asp), d-Asp, l-isoAsp, and d-isoAsp could be separated using the UPLC system with a conventional reversed-phase column and mobile phase. The quantification of these peptides was determined using a stable isotope [(15)N]-labeled Abeta1-40 internal standard. The CCD-UPLC-MS/MS assay of potential N-Abeta1-5 allowed for the discovery of the present and ratio levels of these N-Abeta1-5 sequences with l-Asp, d-Asp, l-isoAsp, and d-isoAsp.",

    "abstract": "FE65 is a cytosolic adapter protein and an important binding partner of amyloid precursor protein. Dependent on Thr668 phosphorylation in amyloid precursor protein, which influences amyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein processing, FE65 undergoes nuclear translocation, thereby transmitting a signal from the cell membrane to the nucleus. As this translocation may be relevant in Alzheimer disease, and as FE65 consists of three protein-protein interaction domains able to bind and affect a variety of other proteins and downstream signaling pathways, the identification of the FE65 interactome is of central interest in Alzheimer disease research. In this study, we identified 121 proteins as new potential FE65 interacting proteins in a pulldown/mass spectrometry approach using human post-mortem brain samples as protein pools for recombinantly expressed FE65. Co-immunoprecipitation assays further validated the interaction of FE65 with the candidates SV2A and SERCA2. In parallel, we investigated the whole cell proteome of primary hippocampal neurons from FE65/FE65L1 double knockout mice. Notably, the validated FE65 binding proteins were also found to be differentially abundant in neurons derived from the FE65 knockout mice relative to wild-type control neurons. SERCA2 is an important player in cellular calcium homeostasis, which was found to be up-regulated in double knockout neurons. Indeed, knock-down of FE65 in HEK293T cells also evoked an elevated sensitivity to thapsigargin, a stressor specifically targeting the activity of SERCA2. Thus, our results suggest that FE65 is involved in the regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis. Whereas transfection of FE65 alone caused a typical dot-like phenotype in the nucleus, co-transfection of SV2A significantly reduced the percentage of FE65 dot-positive cells, pointing to a possible role for SV2A in the modulation of FE65 intracellular targeting. Given that SV2A has a signaling function at the presynapse, its effect on FE65 intracellular localization suggests that the SV2A/FE65 interaction might play a role in synaptic signal transduction.",

The toxicity of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) has been implicated as a critical cause in the development of AD, and Abeta-amyloid-induced toxicity is typically associated with apoptosis. Here, we investigated the effect of 17beta-estradiol (E2) on Abeta-induced toxicity in cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). Our data showed a significant induction of apoptosis in neurons treated with Abeta, and the addition of E2 reduced this effect. In addition, E2 reduced the Abeta-induced up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-xL, and inhibited the subsequent mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase-3. Moreover, E2 inhibited Abeta-induced c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) activation. Taken together, these findings indicate that E2 protects against Abeta-induced apoptosis in neuronal cells by preventing mitochondrial dysfunction and interfering with the JNK signalling cascade.",

    "abstract": "The amyloidogenic cascade is regarded as a key factor at the basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. The aberrant cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) induces an increased production and a subsequent aggregation of beta amyloid (Abeta) peptide in limbic and association cortices. As a result, altered neuronal homeostasis and oxidative injury provoke tangle formation with consequent neuronal loss. Cannabidiol (CBD), a Cannabis derivative devoid of psychotropic effects, has attracted much attention because it may beneficially interfere with several Abeta-triggered neurodegenerative pathways, even though the mechanism responsible for such actions remains unknown. In the present research, the role of CBD was investigated as a possible modulating compound of APP processing in SHSY5Y(APP+) neurons. In addition, the putative involvement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) was explored as a candidate molecular site responsible for CBD actions. Results indicated the CBD capability to induce the ubiquitination of APP protein which led to a substantial decrease in APP full length protein levels in SHSY5Y(APP+) with the consequent decrease in Abeta production. Moreover, CBD promoted an increased survival of SHSY5Y(APP+) neurons, by reducing their long-term apoptotic rate. Obtained results also showed that all, here observed, CBD effects were dependent on the selective activation of PPARgamma.",

    "abstract": "Polyglutamine (polyQ) amyloid fibrils are observed in disease tissue and have been implicated as toxic agents responsible for neurodegeneration in expanded CAG repeat diseases such as Huntington's disease. Despite intensive efforts, the mechanism of amyloid toxicity remains unknown. As a novel approach to probing polyQ toxicity, we investigate here how some cellular and physical properties of polyQ amyloid vary with the chirality of the glutamine residues in the polyQ. We challenged PC12 cells with small amyloid fibrils composed of either L- or D-polyQ peptides and found that D-fibrils are as cytotoxic as L-fibrils. We also found using fluorescence microscopy that both aggregates effectively seed the aggregation of cell-produced L-polyQ proteins, suggesting a surprising lack of stereochemical restriction in seeded elongation of polyQ amyloid. To investigate this effect further, we studied chemically synthesized D- and L-polyQ in vitro. We found that, as expected, D-polyQ monomers are not recognized by proteins that recognize L-polyQ monomers. However, amyloid fibrils prepared from D-polyQ peptides can efficiently seed the aggregation of L-polyQ monomers in vitro, and vice versa. This result is consistent with our cell results on polyQ recruitment but is inconsistent with previous literature reports on the chiral specificity of amyloid seeding. This chiral cross-seeding can be rationalized by a model for seeded elongation featuring a \"rippled beta-sheet\" interface between seed fibril and docked monomers of opposite chirality. The lack of chiral discrimination in polyQ amyloid cytotoxicity is consistent with several toxicity mechanisms, including recruitment of cellular polyQ proteins.",

We hypothesized that functional synaptic disconnections within cortical columnar microcircuits by pathological beta-amyloid accumulation, rather than cell death, initially causes the cognitive impairments. During development of cortical beta-amyloidosis with still few plaques in the transgenic 5xFAD mouse model single cell resolution mapping of neuronal thallium uptake revealed that electrical activity of pyramidal cells breaks down throughout infragranular cortical layer V long before cell death occurs. Treatment of 5xFAD mice with the glutaminyl cyclase inhibitor, PQ 529, partially prevented the decline of pyramidal cell activity, indicating pyroglutamate-modified forms, potentially mixed oligomers of Abeta are contributing to neuronal impairment. Laminar investigation of cortical circuit dysfunction with current source density analysis identified an early loss of excitatory synaptic input in infragranular layers, linked to pathological recurrent activations in supragranular layers. This specific disruption of normal cross-laminar cortical processing coincided with a decline of contextual fear learning.",

    "abstract": "Many endogenous factors influence the time course and extent of the detrimental effects of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) on synaptic function. Here, we assessed the impact of varying endogenous glutamatergic and cholinergic transmission by pharmacological means on the disruption of plasticity at hippocampal CA3-to-CA1 synapses in the anaesthetized rat. NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are considered critical in mediating Abeta-induced inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP). However, intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta1-42 inhibited not only NMDAR-dependent LTP but also voltage-activated Ca(2+)-dependent LTP induced by strong conditioning stimulation during NMDAR blockade. On the other hand, another form of NMDAR-independent synaptic plasticity, endogenous acetylcholine-induced muscarinic receptor-dependent long-term enhancement, was not hindered by Abeta1-42. Interestingly, augmenting endogenous acetylcholine activation of nicotinic receptors prior to the injection of Abeta1-42 prevented the inhibition of NMDAR-dependent LTP, whereas the same intervention when introduced after the infusion of Abeta was ineffective. We also examined the duration of action of Abeta, including water soluble Abeta from Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Remarkably, the inhibition of LTP induction caused by a single injection of sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable Abeta dimer-containing AD brain extract persisted for at least a week. These findings highlight the need to increase our understanding of non-NMDAR mechanisms and of developing novel means of overcoming, rather than just preventing, the deleterious synaptic actions of Abeta.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly population. Accumulation, aggregation, and deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides generated through proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) are likely initiating events in the pathogenesis of AD. While Abeta production is accelerated in familial AD, increasing evidence indicates that impaired clearance of Abeta is responsible for late-onset AD. Because Abeta is mainly generated in neurons, these cells are predicted to have the highest risk of encountering Abeta among all cell types in the brain. However, it is still unclear whether they are also involved in Abeta clearance. Here we show that receptor-mediated endocytosis in neurons by the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) plays a critical role in brain Abeta clearance. LRP1 is known to be an endocytic receptor for multiple ligands including Abeta. Conditional knock-out of Lrp1 in mouse forebrain neurons leads to increased brain Abeta levels and exacerbated amyloid plaque deposition selectively in the cortex of amyloid model APP/PS1 mice without affecting Abeta production. In vivo microdialysis studies demonstrated that Abeta clearance in brain interstitial fluid is impaired in neuronal Lrp1 knock-out mice. Because the neuronal LRP1-deletion did not affect the mRNA levels of major Abeta degrading enzymes, neprilysin and insulin-degrading enzyme, the disturbed Abeta clearance is likely due to the suppression of LRP1-mediated neuronal Abeta uptake and degradation. Together, our results demonstrate that LRP1 plays an important role in receptor-mediated clearance of Abeta and indicate that neurons not only produce but also clear Abeta.",

In vitro models suggest lipid membranes to be the driving force of Abeta conversion. To this end, we generated two novel mouse models, expressing either membrane-anchored or nonanchored versions of the human Abeta42 peptide. Strikingly, membrane-anchored Abeta42 robustly accelerated Abeta deposition and exacerbated amyloid-associated toxicity upon crossing with Abeta precursor protein transgenic mice.

PROCEDURES: Five (13)N-labelled azo compounds (1-5) were synthesized using a three-step process using cyclotron-produced [(13)N]NO3 (-). Biodistribution studies were performed using positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) on 20-month-old healthy, wild-type (WT) mice. In vivo and in vitro binding assays were performed using PET-CT and autoradiography, respectively, on 20-month-old healthy (WT) mice and transgenic (Tg2576) Alzheimer's disease model mice. RESULTS: (13)N-labelled azo compounds were prepared with decay corrected radiochemical yields in the range 27 +- 4 % to 39 +- 4 %. Biodistribution studies showed good blood-brain barrier penetration for compounds 1 and 3-5; good clearance data were also obtained for compounds 1-3 and 5. Compounds 2, 3 and 5 (but not 1) showed a significant uptake in beta-amyloid-rich structures when assayed in in vitro autoradiographic studies. PET studies showed significant uptake of compounds 2 and 3 in the cortex of transgenic animals that exhibit beta-amyloid deposits. CONCLUSIONS: The results underscore the potential of compounds 2 and 3 as in vitro and in vivo markers for beta-amyloid in animal models of Alzheimer's disease.",

Conventional methods to study this reaction are not sensitive to events taking place early in the lag phase promoting the assumption that only monomeric or oligomeric species are present at early stages and that the lag time is defined by the primary nucleation rate only. Here we exploit the high sensitivity of chemical chain reactions to the reagent composition to develop an assay which improves by 2 orders of magnitude the detection limit of conventional bulk techniques and allows the concentration of fibrillar Abeta42 propagons to be detected and quantified even during the lag time. The method relies on the chain reaction multiplication of a small number of initial fibrils by secondary nucleation on the fibril surface in the presence of monomeric peptides, allowing the quantification of the number of initial propagons by comparing the multiplication reaction kinetics with controlled seeding data. The quantitative results of the chain reaction assay are confirmed by qualitative transmission electron microscopy analysis. The results demonstrate the nonlinearity of the aggregation process which involves both primary and secondary nucleation events even at the early stages of the reaction during the lag-phase.",

Moreover, Cu-Abeta complexes are able to catalyze the production of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, and oligomeric Cu-Abeta was reported to be more reactive. The flexibility of the unstructured Abeta peptide leads to the formation of a multitude of different forms of both Cu(I) and Cu(II) complexes. This raised the question of the structure-function relationship. We address this question for the biologically relevant Fenton-type reaction. Computational models for the Cu-Abeta complex in monomeric and dimeric forms were built, and their redox behavior was analyzed together with their reactivity with peroxide. A set of 16 configurations of Cu-Abeta was studied and the configurations were classified into 3 groups: (A) configurations that evolve into a linearly bound and nonreactive Cu(I) coordination; (B) reactive configurations without large reorganization between the two Cu redox states; and (C) reactive configurations with an open structure in the Cu(I)-Abeta coordination, which have high water accessibility to Cu. All the structures that showed high reactivity with H2O2 (to form HO( )) fall into class C. This means that within all the possible configurations, only some pools are able to produce efficiently the deleterious HO( ), while the other pools are more inert. The characteristics of highly reactive configurations consist of a N-Cu(I)-N coordination with an angle far from 180  and high water crowding at the open side. This allows the side-on entrance of H2O2 and its cleavage to form a hydroxyl radical. Interestingly, the reactive Cu(I)-Abeta states originated mostly from the dimeric starting models, in agreement with the higher reactivity of oligomers. Our study gives a rationale for the Fenton-type reactivity of Cu-Abeta and how dimeric Cu-Abeta could lead to a higher reactivity. This opens a new therapeutic angle of attack against Cu-Abeta-based reactive oxygen species production.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes appear to share similar pathogenic mechanisms. dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) underlies peripheral insulin resistance in metabolic disorders. PKR phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha-P), and AD brains exhibit elevated phospho-PKR and eIF2alpha-P levels. Whether and how PKR and eIF2alpha-P participate in defective brain insulin signaling and cognitive impairment in AD are unknown. We report that beta-amyloid oligomers, AD-associated toxins, activate PKR in a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-dependent manner, resulting in eIF2alpha-P, neuronal insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) inhibition, synapse loss, and memory impairment. Brain phospho-PKR and eIF2alpha-P were elevated in AD animal models, including monkeys given intracerebroventricular oligomer infusions. Oligomers failed to trigger eIF2alpha-P and cognitive impairment in PKR(-/-) and TNFR1(-/-) mice. Bolstering insulin signaling rescued phospho-PKR and eIF2alpha-P. Results reveal pathogenic mechanisms shared by AD and diabetes and establish that proinflammatory signaling mediates oligomer-induced IRS-1 inhibition and PKR-dependent synapse and memory loss.",

    "abstract": "The neurotoxicity of amyloid- beta (A beta ) has been implicated as a critical cause of Alzheimer's disease. Isorhynchophylline (IRN), an oxindole alkaloid isolated from Uncaria rhynchophylla, exerts neuroprotective effect against Abeta 25-35-induced neurotoxicity in vitro. However, the exact mechanism for its neuroprotective effect is not well understood. The present study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective action of IRN against Abeta 25-35-induced neurotoxicity in cultured rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Pretreatment with IRN significantly increased the cell viability, inhibited the release of lactate dehydrogenase and the extent of DNA fragmentation in Abeta 25-35-treated cells. IRN treatment was able to enhance the protein levels of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (p-GSK-3 beta ). Lithium chloride blocked Abeta 25-35-induced cellular apoptosis in a similar manner as IRN, suggesting that GSK-3 beta inhibition was involved in neuroprotective action of IRN. Pretreatment with LY294002 completely abolished the protective effects of IRN. Furthermore, IRN reversed Abeta 25-35-induced attenuation in the level of phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element binding protein (p-CREB) and the effect of IRN could be blocked by the PI3K inhibitor. These experimental findings unambiguously suggested that the protective effect of IRN against Abeta 25-35-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells was associated with the enhancement of p-CREB expression via PI3K/Akt/GSK-3 beta signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Human memory is a highly heritable polygenic trait with complex inheritance patterns. To study the genetics of memory and memory-related diseases, hippocampal functioning has served as an intermediate phenotype. The importance of investigating gene-gene effects on complex phenotypes has been emphasized, but most imaging studies still focus on single polymorphisms. APOE epsilon4 and BDNF Met, two of the most studied gene variants for variability in memory performance and neuropsychiatric disorders, have both separately been related to poorer episodic memory and altered hippocampal functioning. Here, we investigated the combined effect of APOE and BDNF on hippocampal activation (N=151). No non-additive interaction effects were seen. Instead, the results revealed decreased activation in bilateral hippocampus and parahippocampus as a function of the number of APOE epsilon4 and BDNF Met alleles present (neither, one, or both). The combined effect was stronger than either of the individual effects, and both gene variables explained significant proportions of variance in BOLD signal change. Thus, there was an additive gene-gene effect of APOE and BDNF on medial temporal lobe (MTL) activation, showing that a larger proportion of variance in brain activation attributed to genetics can be explained by considering more than one gene variant. This effect might be relevant for the understanding of normal variability in memory function as well as memory-related disorders associated with APOE and BDNF.",

    "abstract": "Cellular damage by reactive oxygen species and altered neurogenesis are implicated in the etiology of AD and the pathogenic actions of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta); the underlying mechanisms and the early oxidative intracellular events triggered by Abeta are not established. In the present study, we found that mouse embryonic cortical neural progenitor cells exhibit intermittent spontaneous mitochondrial superoxide (SO) flashes that require transient opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mPTPs). The incidence of mitochondria SO flash activity in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) increased during the first 6-24 hours of exposure to aggregating amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta1-42), indicating an increase in transient mPTP opening. Subsequently, the SO flash frequency progressively decreased and ceased between 48 and 72 hours of exposure to Abeta1-42, during which time global cellular reactive oxygen species increased, mitochondrial membrane potential decreased, cytochrome C was released from mitochondria and the cells degenerated. Inhibition of mPTPs and selective reduction in mitochondrial SO flashes significantly ameliorated the negative effects of Abeta1-42 on NPC proliferation and survival. Our findings suggest that mPTP-mediated bursts of mitochondrial SO production is a relatively early and pivotal event in the adverse effects of Abeta1-42 on NPCs. If Abeta inhibits NPC proliferation in the brains of AD patients by a similar mechanism, then interventions that inhibit mPTP-mediated superoxide flashes would be expected to protect NPCs against the adverse effects of Abeta.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A subset of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) present with early and prominent language deficits. It is unclear whether the burden of underlying beta-amyloid pathology is associated with language or general cognitive impairment in these subjects. METHODS: The relationship between cortical beta-amyloid burden on [(11) C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) and performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Wechsler Memory Scale - Third Edition (WMS-III), the Boston Naming Test (BNT) and the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) was assessed using regression and correlation analyses in subjects presenting with aphasia who showed beta-amyloid deposition on PiB PET. RESULTS: The global PiB ratio was inversely correlated with MoCA (P = 0.02) and the WMS-III Visual Reproduction (VR) subtest (VR I, P = 0.02; VR II, P = 0.04). However, the correlations between PiB ratio, BNT (P = 0.13), WAB aphasia quotient (P = 0.11) and WAB repetition scores (P = 0.34) were not significant. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that an increased cortical beta-amyloid burden is associated with cognitive impairment, but not language deficits, in AD subjects presenting with aphasia. The results suggest that beta-amyloid deposition could be partly contributing to impaired cognition in such patients whilst language dysfunction may be more influenced by other pathological mechanisms, perhaps downstream pathways of beta-amyloid deposition.",

However, whether imatinib has this effect in humans is not known. METHODS: Plasma levels of Abeta42 were analyzed in sequential samples from CML patients treated with imatinib (n=51). The effect of imatinib on Abeta production was also investigated in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells overexpressing the amyloid precursor protein (APP) with the Swedish mutation, in mouse primary cortical neurons and in human Down syndrome embryonic stem-cell-derived cortical neurons. RESULTS: Twelve months of imatinib treatment did not lower plasma Abeta42 levels in CML patients, and imatinib treatment did not lead to less Abeta42 production in any of the in vitro models whereas beta- and gamma-secretase inhibitors did. CONCLUSION: These data question the previously described role of imatinib in inhibiting amyloidogenic APP processing and as a drug candidate for AD.",

    "abstract": "Besides amyloid and tau pathology, a constant feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an intense inflammatory response, which is considered an active player in its pathogenesis. The 5-Lipoxygenase (5LO) is a proinflammatory enzyme and an endogenous modulator of AD-like phenotype in mouse models of the disease. To further understand the role of 5LO in AD pathogenesis, we exposed the triple transgenic (3xTg) and 3xTg/5LO knockout mice to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known inducer of neuroinflammation, and evaluated its effect on their AD-like phenotype. 3xTg mice treated with LPS manifested a worsening of behavior, gamma-secretase up-regulation, and increased neuroinflammatory responses. These effects were completely prevented in 3xTg mice genetically deficient for 5LO. By contrast, the absence of 5LO did not protect against increase in tau phosphorylation at specific epitopes that were mediated by the activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 5. Our data demonstrate that the 5LO pathway affects key neuropathological features of the AD-like phenotype (behavior, abeta, microgliosis, astrocytosis) but not others (tau pathology) in the LPS-dependent neuroinflammation model. The opposite ways whereby 5LO influences the LPS-dependent effects in vivo supports the complex nature of the neuroinflammatory response in AD and its differential role in modulating amyloid and tau neuropathology.",

    "abstract": "We have compared the protein profiles in plaques and tangles in the hippocampus of post-mortem Alzheimer brains and in opaque and clear regions in the deep cortex of eye lenses of the same donors. From the 7 Alzheimer donors studied, 1 had pronounced bilateral cortical lens opacities, 1 moderate and 5 only minor or no cortical opacities. We focused on beta-sheet levels, a hallmarking property of amyloid-beta, the major protein of plaques and tau protein, the major protein of tangles in Alzheimer brains. Confocal Raman microspectroscopy and imaging was used in combination with hierarchical cluster analysis. Plaques and tangles show high levels of beta-sheets with a beta-sheet to protein ratio of 1.67. This ratio is 1.12 in unaffected brain tissue surrounding the plaques and tangles. In the lenses this ratio is 1.17 independently of the presence or absence of opacities. This major difference in beta-sheet conformation between hippocampus and lens is supported by Congo red and immunostaining of amyloid-beta and tau which were positive for plaques and tangles in the hippocampus but fully negative for the lens irrespective of the presence or absence of opacities. In line with a previous study (Michael et al., 2013) we conclude that cortical lens opacities are not typical for Alzheimer patients and are not hallmarked by accumulation of amyloid-beta, and can thus not be considered as predictors or indicators of Alzheimer disease as claimed by Goldstein et al. (2003).",

    "abstract": "Targeting amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) within the brain is a strategy actively sought for therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the ability of liposomes bi-functionalized with phosphatidic acid and with a modified ApoE-derived peptide (mApoE-PA-LIP) to affect Abeta aggregation/disaggregation features and to cross in vitro and in vivo the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Surface plasmon resonance showed that bi-functionalized liposomes strongly bind Abeta (kD=0.6 muM), while Thioflavin-T and SDS-PAGE/WB assays show that liposomes inhibit peptide aggregation (70% inhibition after 72 h) and trigger the disaggregation of preformed aggregates (60% decrease after 120 h incubation). Moreover, experiments with dually radiolabelled LIP suggest that bi-functionalization enhances the passage of radioactivity across the BBB either in vitro (permeability=2.5x10(-5) cm/min, 5-fold higher with respect to mono-functionalized liposomes) or in vivo in healthy mice. Taken together, our results suggest that mApoE-PA-LIP are valuable nanodevices with a potential applicability in vivo for the treatment of AD. From the clinical editor: Bi-functionalized liposomes with phosphatidic acid and a modified ApoE-derived peptide were demonstrated to influence Abeta aggregation/disaggregation as a potential treatment in an Alzheimer's model. The liposomes were able to cross the blood-brain barrier in vitro and in vivo. Similar liposomes may become clinically valuable nanodevices with a potential applicability for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition of Abeta production and clearance of senile plaques have been considered as potential strategies in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Activated protein C (APC) is an important factor in the anticoagulant system. However, whether APC can influence the condition of a chronic neurodegenerative process, such as that present in AD, is unknown. In this study, we found that administration of APC on AD Tg2576 mice significantly reduced amyloid beta production and helped to facilitate cognitive improvement. APC could also reduce levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42 produced in APPswe cells, an AD cell model. Further results demonstrated that APC did not change the levels of Abeta-degrading enzymes, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), or neprilysin (NEP). Next, we found that APC promoted sAPPalpha and CTFalpha release and inhibited sAPPbeta and CTFbeta release, thereby indicating that APC could regulate Abeta secretion by shifting APP processing from the amyloidogenic pathway toward the nonamyloidogenic pathway. Correspondingly, further study revealed that ADAM-10 expression was increased by APC, suggesting that APC inhibits Abeta secretion through stimulating activity of alpha-secretase. These findings support the idea that APC could hold therapeutic potential in the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plays a crucial role in the onset and progression of atherosclerosis. Macrophages are a source of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), cysteine proteases and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 in the vascular wall. The aims of this study were to analyze the capacity of Abeta peptide (1-40) (Abeta40), Abeta peptide (1-42) (Abeta42) and fibrillar Abeta42 (fAbeta42) to modulate the expression and activity of MMP-9, MMP-2 and tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 (TIMP-1) in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM). Additionally, we analyzed whether Abeta internalization alters the secretion of cathepsin S (CatS) and TGF-beta1 by macrophages. METHODS: HMDM were exposed to native and fibrillar Abeta. MMPs and TIMP-1 expression was analyzed by real-time PCR, and MMP abundance by zymography. Protein levels of precursor and active forms of CatS were analyzed by Western blot and TGF-beta1 levels by ELISA. RESULTS: Abeta40, Abeta42 and especially fAbeta42 strongly induced MMP-9/MMP-2 levels. Moreover, we showed enhanced active CatS and reduced TGF-beta1 protein levels in the secretome of Abeta42 and fAbeta42-exposed macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Abeta can regulate the proinflammatory state of human macrophages by inducing metallo- and cysteine protease levels and by reducing TGF-beta1 secretion. These effects may be crucial in atherosclerosis progression.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition, which activates microglia, induces neuroinflammation and drives neurodegeneration. Recent evidence indicates that soluble pre-fibrillar Abeta species, rather than insoluble fibrils, are the most toxic forms of Abeta. Preventing soluble Abeta formation represents, therefore, a major goal in AD. We investigated whether microvesicles (MVs) released extracellularly by reactive microglia may contribute to AD degeneration. We found that production of myeloid MVs, likely of microglial origin, is strikingly high in AD patients and in subjects with mild cognitive impairment and that AD MVs are toxic for cultured neurons. The mechanism responsible for MV neurotoxicity was defined in vitro using MVs produced by primary microglia. We demonstrated that neurotoxicity of MVs results from (i) the capability of MV lipids to promote formation of soluble Abeta species from extracellular insoluble aggregates and (ii) from the presence of neurotoxic Abeta forms trafficked to MVs after Abeta internalization into microglia. MV neurotoxicity was neutralized by the Abeta-interacting protein PrP and anti-Abeta antibodies, which prevented binding to neurons of neurotoxic soluble Abeta species. This study identifies microglia-derived MVs as a novel mechanism by which microglia participate in AD degeneration, and suggest new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of the disease.",

TTR-beta-amyloid (Abeta) complexes have been isolated from APP23 and some human AD brains. We now show that substoichiometric concentrations of TTR tetramers suppress Abeta aggregation in vitro via an interaction between the thyroxine binding pocket of the TTR tetramer and Abeta residues 18-21 (nuclear magnetic resonance and epitope mapping). The K(D) is micromolar, and the stoichiometry is <1 for the interaction (isothermal titration calorimetry). Similar experiments show that engineered monomeric TTR, the best inhibitor of Abeta fibril formation in vitro, did not bind Abeta monomers in liquid phase, suggesting that inhibition of fibrillogenesis is mediated by TTR tetramer binding to Abeta monomer and both tetramer and monomer binding of Abeta oligomers. The thousand-fold greater concentration of tetramer relative to monomer in vivo makes it the likely suppressor of Abeta aggregation and disease in the APP23 mice.",

In the present study, using in vitro approaches, we demonstrated that CP were able to diminish amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels in cell cultures, reducing Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. For in vivo studies, CPECs were transplanted into the brain of the APP/PS1 murine model of AD that exhibits advanced Abeta accumulation and memory impairment. Brain examination after cell implantation revealed a significant reduction in brain Abeta deposits, hyperphosphorylation of tau, and astrocytic reactivity. Remarkably, the transplantation of CPECs was accompanied by a total behavioral recovery in APP/PS1 mice, improving spatial and non-spatial memory.

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence demonstrates that beta-amyloid (Abeta) elicits oxidative stress, which contributes to the pathogenesis and disease progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, there is interest in developing antioxidant therapies for the prevention/treatment of cognitive decline during AD. We reported previously that puerarin has antioxidative properties in vitro. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine whether puerarin improves cognitive function and reduces oxidative stress in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) mice, a well established AD mouse model, and explore its potential mechanism. Our results show that oral administration of puerarin significantly ameliorates cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM) test. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) through, at least in part, induction of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) target gene heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice at 9 months of age, but without altering brain Abeta burden. Furthermore, puerarin significantly activated Akt, reduced activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta), and induced nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice but did not alter ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Thus, puerarin may improve cognitive performance in APP/PS1 mice through activation of the Akt/GSK-3beta signaling pathway. These findings suggest that puerarin might be an attractive agent for prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment and dementia.",

This study investigates the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of the cortex from APP/PS1 transgenic mice and control mice using the Roche NimbleGen chip platform. Functional analysis was then conducted by Ingenuity Pathways Analysis system. The methylated DNA fragments in the genome of each sample were enriched by MeDIP and the whole-genome interrogations were hybridized to the Roche NimbleGen Human DNA Methylation 3x720 K CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter Array that cover 15,980 CpG islands and 20,404 reference gene promoter regions of the entire human genome. Analysis reveals 2346 CpG sites representing 485 unique genes as potentially associated with AD disease status pending confirmation in additional study. At the same time, these hyper-methylated genes display familial aggregation. An impairment of the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) signaling pathway has been demonstrated to be specific to the AD brain and, particularly, to the early phase of the disease, supporting a role for epigenetic change of TGF-beta1 in AD pathology. In future research, we will focus on TGF-beta1, as it appeared to be the most promising candidate for AD.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide play central roles in the pathology and etiology of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-induced impairments in neurogenesis have been investigated in several transgenic mouse models but the mechanism of action remains to be conclusively demonstrated. The changes in neurogenesis during this transition of increasing Abeta levels and plaque formation were investigated in the present study. We found that the proliferation of newborn cell in the dentate gyrus was enhanced prior to elevations in soluble Abeta production as well as amyloid deposition in 5-week-old TgCRND8 mice, which are well-established Alzheimer's disease models, compared to non-transgenic (Non-Tg) mice. The number of BrdU-positive cells remained higher in TgCRND8 vs Non-Tg mice for a period of 8weeks. The numbers of BrdU/NeuN-positive cells were not significantly different in TgCRND8 compared to Non-Tg mice. A significant decrease in BrdU/GFAP but not in BrdU/S100beta was found in Tg vs Non-Tg at 6-weeks of age. In addition, a unique observation was made using isolated neuroprogenitor cells from TgCRND8 mice which were found to be less viable in culture and produced substantial amounts of secreted Abeta peptides. This suggests that the proliferation of neural progenitors in vivo may be modulated by high levels of APP expression and the resulting Abeta generated directly by the progenitor cells. These findings indicate that cell proliferation is increased prior to Abeta deposition and that cell viability is decreased in TgCRND8 mice over time.",

Although gamma-secretase has essential functions across metazoans, no essential roles have been identified for BACE1 or Abeta. Because their only known function results in a disease phenotype, we sought to understand these components from an evolutionary perspective. We show that APP-like proteins are found throughout most animal taxa, but sequences homologous to Abeta are not found outside gnathostomes and the beta cut site is only conserved within sarcopterygians. BACE1 enzymes, however, extend through basal chordates and as far as cnidaria. We then sought to determine whether BACE1 from a species that never evolved Abeta could proteolyze APP substrates that include Abeta. We demonstrate that BACE1 from a basal chordate is a functional ortholog that can liberate Abeta from full-length human APP, indicating BACE1 activity evolved at least 360 My before Abeta.",

We used a high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) variant that can map metabolic defects in patients and mouse models to address basic questions about entorhinal cortex pathophysiology. The entorhinal cortex is divided into functionally distinct regions, the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), and we exploited the high-resolution capabilities of the fMRI variant to ask whether either of them was affected in patients with preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Next, we imaged three mouse models of disease to clarify how tau and APP relate to entorhinal cortex dysfunction and to determine whether the entorhinal cortex can act as a source of dysfunction observed in other cortical areas. We found that the LEC was affected in preclinical disease, that LEC dysfunction could spread to the parietal cortex during preclinical disease and that APP expression potentiated tau toxicity in driving LEC dysfunction, thereby helping to explain regional vulnerability in the disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is neuropathologically characterized by accumulation of insoluble fibrous inclusions in the brain in the form of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular senile plaques. Perturbation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) has long been considered an attractive hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of AD. However, studies on UPS functionality with various methods and AD models have achieved non-conclusive results. To get further insight into UPS functionality in AD, we have crossed a well-documented APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mouse model with a UPS functionality reporter, GFPu, mouse expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) fused to a constitutive degradation signal (CL-1) that facilitates its rapid turnover in conditions of a normal UPS. Our western blot results indicate that GFPu reporter protein was accumulated in the cortex and hippocampus, but not striatum in the APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mouse model at 4 weeks of age, which is confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and elevated levels of p53, an endogenous UPS substrate. In accordance with this, the levels of ubiquitinated proteins were elevated in the AD mouse model. These results suggest that UPS is either impaired or functionally insufficient in specific brain regions in the APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mouse model at a very young age, long before senile plaque formation and the onset of memory loss. These observations may shed new light on the pathogenesis of AD.",

    "abstract": "A minimally invasive test for early detection and monitoring of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases is a highly unmet need for drug development and planning of patient care. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a syndrome characteristic of early stages of many neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, we have identified two sets of circulating brain-enriched miRNAs, the miR-132 family (miR-128, miR-132, miR-874) normalized per miR-491-5p and the miR-134 family (miR-134, miR-323-3p, miR-382) normalized per miR-370, capable of differentiating MCI from age-matched control (AMC) with high accuracy. Here we report a biomarker validation study of the identified miRNA pairs using larger independent sets of age- and gender- matched plasma samples. The biomarker pairs detected MCI with sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy similar to those obtained in the first study. The miR-132 family biomarkers differentiated MCI from AMC with 84%-94% sensitivity and 96%-98% specificity, and the miR-134 family biomarkers demonstrated 74%-88% sensitivity and 80-92% specificity. When miRNAs of the same family were combined, miR-132 and miR-134 family biomarkers demonstrated 96% and 87% overall accuracy, respectively. No statistically significant differences in the biomarker concentrations in samples obtained from male and female subjects were observed for either MCI or AMC. The present study also demonstrated that the highest sensitivity and specificity are achieved with pairs of miRNAs whose concentrations in plasma are highly correlated.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by the deposition of extracellular amyloid-beta plaques and intracellular aggregation of tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (1, 2). Progression of NFT pathology is closely correlated with both increased neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD (3) and other tauopathies, such as frontotemporal dementia (4, 5). The assumption that mislocalization of tau into the somatodendritic compartment (6) and accumulation of fibrillar aggregates in NFTs mediates neurodegeneration underlies most current therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing NFT formation or disrupting existing NFTs (7, 8). Although several disease-associated mutations cause both aggregation of tau and neurodegeneration, whether NFTs per se contribute to neuronal and network dysfunction in vivo is unknown (9). Here we used awake in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to monitor neuronal function in adult rTg4510 mice that overexpress a human mutant form of tau (P301L) and develop cortical NFTs by the age of 7-8 mo (10). Unexpectedly, NFT-bearing neurons in the visual cortex appeared to be completely functionally intact, to be capable of integrating dendritic inputs and effectively encoding orientation and direction selectivity, and to have a stable baseline resting calcium level. These results suggest a reevaluation of the common assumption that insoluble tau aggregates are sufficient to disrupt neuronal function.",

SPARE-AD was first established as a highly sensitive and specific MRI-marker of AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) subjects (AUC = 0.98). Baseline predictive values of all aforementioned indices were then compared using survival analysis on 381 MCI subjects. SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog were found to have similar predictive value, and their combination was significantly better than their individual performance. APOE genotype did not significantly improve prediction, although the combination of SPARE-AD, ADAS-Cog and APOE epsilon4 provided the highest hazard ratio estimates of 17.8 (last vs. first quartile). In a subset of 192 MCI patients who also had CSF biomarkers, the addition of Abeta1-42, t-tau, and p-tau181p to the previous model did not improve predictive value significantly over SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog combined. Importantly, in amyloid-negative patients with MCI, SPARE-AD had high predictive power of clinical progression. Our findings suggest that SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog in combination offer the highest predictive power of conversion from MCI to AD, which is improved, albeit not significantly, by APOE genotype. The finding that SPARE-AD in amyloid-negative MCI patients was predictive of clinical progression is not expected under the amyloid hypothesis and merits further investigation.",

Providing that trigonelline possesses the requested pharmacokinetic properties, once attaining pharmacodynamic phase it must interact effectively with the relevant molecular site in the brain, which is characteristic to neurodegenerative diseases, namely the beta-amyloid peptide.

We report a novel compound (ML) prototype of a rationally designed molecule obtained by integrating structural elements for Abeta aggregation control, metal chelation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, and antioxidant activity within a single molecule. Chemical, biochemical, ion mobility mass spectrometric, and NMR studies indicate that the compound ML targets metal-free and metal-bound Abeta (metal-Abeta) species, suppresses Abeta aggregation in vitro, and diminishes toxicity induced by Abeta and metal-treated Abeta in living cells. Comparison of ML to its structural moieties (i.e., 4-(dimethylamino)phenol (DAP) and (8-aminoquinolin-2-yl)methanol (1)) for reactivity with Abeta and metal-Abeta suggests the synergy of incorporating structural components for both metal chelation and Abeta interaction. Moreover, ML is water-soluble and potentially brain permeable, as well as regulates the formation and presence of free radicals. Overall, we demonstrate that a rational structure-based design strategy can generate a small molecule that can target and modulate multiple factors, providing a new tool to uncover and address AD complexity.",

The current study was designed to investigate the protective effects of osthole on a cell model of AD insulted by exogenous Abeta25-35 and the potential mechanism(s).

Our data showed that osthole reduced intracellular Abeta levels in neural cells, which was associated with decreased BACE1 protein; osthole reversed exogenous Abeta25-35-induced cell viability loss, apoptosis, and synapsin-1 reduction, which was related to the reestablishment of phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB).

We investigated the effects of GV1001 against beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomer-induced neurotoxicity in rat neural stem cells (NSCs). Primary culture NSCs were treated with several concentrations of GV1001 and/or Abeta25-35 oligomer for 48 hours. GV1001 protected NSCs against the Abeta25-35 oligomer in a concentration-dependent manner. Abeta25-35 concentration dependently decreased viability, proliferation, and mobilization of NSCs and GV1001 treatment restored the cells to wild-type levels. Abeta25-35 increased free radical levels in rat NSCs while combined treatment with GV1001 significantly reduced these levels. In addition, GV1001 treatment of Abeta25-35-injured NSCs increased the expression level of survival-related proteins, including mitochondria-associated survival proteins, and decreased the levels of death and inflammation-related proteins, including mitochondria-associated death proteins. Together, these results suggest that GV1001 possesses neuroprotective effects against Abeta25-35 oligomer in NSCs and that these effects are mediated through mimicking the extra-telomeric functions of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, including the induction of cellular proliferation, anti-apoptotic effects, mitochondrial stabilization, and anti-aging and anti-oxidant effects.",

    "abstract": "TREM and TREM-like receptors are a structurally similar protein family encoded by genes clustered on chromosome 6p21.11. Recent studies have identified a rare coding variant (p.R47H) in TREM2 that confers a high risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, common single nucleotide polymorphisms in this genomic region are associated with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for AD and a common intergenic variant found near the TREML2 gene has been identified to be protective for AD. However, little is known about the functional variant underlying the latter association or its relationship with the p.R47H. Here, we report comprehensive analyses using whole-exome sequencing data, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analyses, meta-analyses (16,254 cases and 20,052 controls) and cell-based functional studies to support the role of the TREML2 coding missense variant p.S144G (rs3747742) as a potential driver of the meta-analysis AD-associated genome-wide association studies signal. Additionally, we demonstrate that the protective role of TREML2 in AD is independent of the role of TREM2 gene as a risk factor for AD.",

    "abstract": "Aging adversely affects inflammatory processes in the brain, which has important implications in the context of disease progression. It has been proposed that microglia become dysfunctional with age and may lose their neuroprotective properties leading to chronic neurodegeneration. Here, we sought to characterize inflammatory changes in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and to delineate differences between normal aging and those associated with disease pathology. A proinflammatory profile, characterized by the upregulation of markers of classical activation, was evident in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, associated with increased interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) concentration and dysregulation of mechanisms designed to limit the proinflammatory response. The data indicate that microglia are not less active with age but alter their phenotype; indeed, changes observed in the deactivation state appear to relate to aging rather than disease pathology. We hypothesize that disruption of the blood-brain barrier, in tandem with an enhanced chemokine profile, permits the infiltration of immune cells serving to reinforce classical activation of microglia through their enhanced responsiveness to IFNgamma.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta)-induced neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigated whether mtDNA T8993G mutation-induced complex V inhibition, clinically associated with neurological muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), is a potential risk factor for AD and the pathological link for long-term exposure of Abeta-induced mitochondrial toxicity and apoptosis in NARP cybrids. Using noninvasive fluorescence probe-coupled laser scanning imaging microscopy and NARP cybrids harboring 98% mutant genes along with its parental 143B osteosarcoma cells, we demonstrated that Abeta-augmented mitochondrial Ca(2+) (mCa(2+))-independent mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) formation for a cardiolipin (CL, a major mitochondrial protective phospholipid)-dependent lethal modulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Abeta augmented not only the amount but also the propagation rate of mROS-induced mROS formation to significantly depolarize mitochondrial membrane potential ( Psi(m)) and reduce mCa(2+) stress. Abeta-augmented mROS oxidized and depleted CL, thereby enhances mitochondrial fission and movement retardation, which promoted the NARP-augmented lethal transient-MPT (t-MPT) to switch to its irreversible mode of permanent-MPT (p-MPT). Interestingly, melatonin, a multiple mitochondrial protector, markedly reduced Abeta-augmented mROS formation and therefore significantly reduced mROS-mediated depolarization of  Psi(m), fission of mitochondria and retardation of mitochondrial movement to stabilize CL and hence the MPT. In the presence of melatonin, Abeta-promoted p-MPT was reversed to a protective t-MPT, which preserved  Psi(m) and lowered elevated mCa(2+) to sublethal levels for an enhanced mCa(2+)-dependent O(2) consumption. Thus, melatonin may potentially rescue AD patients associated with NARP symptoms.",

Brain sections were stained immunocytochemically to detect MMP-1 expression, and histologically to reveal the state of hippocampal neurons. Administration of beta-amyloid peptide induced a significant degeneration of cells in the dorsal hippocampus. This was demonstrated by a significant decrease in the total number of cells and by the appearance of acidophilic neurons of altered (often triangular) shape. Altered cells were most often found in the hippocampal field CA3, and in a smaller quantity in the CA1 field. MMP-1-like immunoreactivity was found in the same hippocampal areas, the staining being restricted to the cells of altered shape (staining of somata and primary neurites). The data suggest possible involvement of the type 1 metalloproteinase in the development of Alzheimer's disease.",

Compounds 2a-c in complex with TcAChE span the gorge with the bis-tacrine system, and the peptide moieties bulge outside the gorge in proximity of the peripheral site. These moieties are likely responsible for the observed reduction of hAChE-induced Abeta aggregation since they physically hamper Abeta binding to the enzyme surface. Moreover, 2a was able to significantly interfere with Abeta self-oligomerization, while 2b,c showed improved inhibition of hAChE-induced Abeta aggregation.",

Three representative ruthenium(III) complexes, namely NAMI A, KP1019, and PMRU20, were specifically evaluated to this end in an established in vitro model of AD relying on primary cortical neurons. Notably, PMRU20 turned out to be highly effective in protecting cortical neurons against Abeta 1-42 toxicity, while the other tested ruthenium compounds were poorly active or even inactive; we also found that PMRU20 is virtually devoid of any significant toxicity in vitro at the applied concentrations. Interestingly, PMRU20 was neuroprotective even against the toxicity induced by Abeta 25-35. The direct reaction of PMRU20 with Abeta 1-42 was explored through ESI MS analysis and some adduct formation evidenced. In addition, thioflavin T assays revealed that PMRU20 greatly reduces Abeta 1-42 aggregation.

Thus, the present study prepared amyloid-beta 42 oli-gomers and constructed a naive human Fab phage display library based on blood samples from six healthy people. After three rounds of biopanning in vitro, a human single-domain antibody that specifically recognized amyloid-beta 42 oligomers was identified. Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated this antibody bound specifically to human amyloid-beta 42 tetramer and nonamer, but not the monomer or high molecular weight oligomers. This study successfully constructed a human phage display library and screened a single-domain antibody that specifically recognized amyloid-beta 42 oligomers.",

    "title": "The therapeutics of Alzheimer's disease: where we stand and where we are heading.",
    "abstract": "Few diagnoses in modern medicine evoke more apprehension in patients and their families than Alzheimer disease (AD). Defined as a clinical and pathological entity a century ago, the disorder only came under intense molecular scrutiny in the mid-1980s. Genetic, histopathological, biochemical, and animal modeling studies have combined to provide evidence that the disease may begin with an imbalance between the production and clearance of the self-aggregating amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in brain regions serving memory and cognition. This concept has been furthered by recent analyses in humans of cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers that suggest an approximate sequence of AD-type brain alterations beginning >2 decades before the onset of dementia. Although the Abeta hypothesis of Alzheimer causation does not explain all features of this multifactorial syndrome, experimental agents that lower or neutralize Abeta have become the major focus of therapeutic research. Several clinical trials in mild-to-moderate AD have not met standard cognitive and functional endpoints, but there were important shortcomings in the agent and/or the trial design in each case. Based on the lessons learned, the field has moved on to test potentially disease-modifying agents in mild AD patients or via secondary prevention in presymptomatic subjects bearing amyloid plaques. Immunotherapeutic agents are receiving the most study, but other antiamyloid strategies and, importantly, nonamyloid targets such as tau and neuroinflammation are of great interest. The pace of recent developments augurs well for 1 or more experimental agents being shown to slow cognitive decline without major side effects. However, research funding from all sources will need to increase dramatically and soon to stave off the approaching tsunami of AD.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation leading to various nanoscale assemblies is under scrutiny due to its implications in a broad range of human diseases. In the present study, we have used ovalbumin, a model non-inhibitory serpin, to elucidate the molecular events involved in amyloid assembly using a diverse array of spectroscopic and imaging tools such as fluorescence, laser Raman, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM images revealed a progressive morphological transition from spherical oligomers to nanoscopic annular pores that further served as templates for higher-order supramolecular assembly into larger amyloid pores. Raman spectroscopic investigations illuminated in-depth molecular details into the secondary structural changes of the protein during amyloid assembly and pore formation. Additionally, Raman measurements indicated the presence of antiparallel beta-sheets in the amyloid core. Overall, our studies revealed that the protein conformational switch in the context of the oligomers triggers the hierarchical assembly into nanoscopic amyloid pores. Our results will have broad implications in the structural characterization of amyloid pores derived from a variety of disease-related proteins.",

    "title": "Effect of Protonation State on the Stability of Amyloid Oligomers Assembled from TTR(105-115).",
    "abstract": "Amyloid fibrils are self-assembled aggregates of polypeptides that are implicated in the development of several human diseases. A peptide derived from amino acids 105-115 of the human plasma protein transthyretin forms homogeneous and well-defined fibrils and, as a model system, has been the focus of a number of studies investigating the formation and structure of this class of aggregates. Self-assembly of TTR(105-115) occurs at low pH, and this work explores the effect of protonation on the growth and stability of small cross-beta aggregates. Using molecular dynamics simulations of structures up to the decamer in both protonated and deprotonated states, we find that, whereas hexamers are more stable for protonated peptides, higher order oligomers are more stable when the peptides are deprotonated. Our findings imply a change in the acid pK of the protonated C-terminal group during the formation of fibrils, which leads to stabilization of higher-order oligomers through electrostatic interactions.",

    "abstract": "We have systematically evaluated the ability of molecular dynamics simulation with implicit solvation models (EEF1.1, SASA, ASPENR, SCPISM, RUSH, ACE2, GBORN, GBSW, GBMV II, FACTS) to characterize the unfolding of the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide and the stabilizing effects of mutations and ligands. The 13-26 region of Abeta (Abeta13-26) unfolds and leads to the formation of amyloid fibrils, the causative agent of Alzheimer's disease. Stabilization of Abeta13-26 decreases Abeta polymerization as well as the formation of intermediate structures, which may also be toxic. The unfolding behavior of wild-type Abeta13-26 with an increase in temperature led us to select GBORN, GBMV II, and SCPISM for further investigation considering their ability to reproduce the stabilizing effect on the Abeta13-26 helical conformation due to mutations (V18A/F19A/F20A and V18L/F19L/F20L) and ligands (Dec-DETA and Pep1b) designed to stabilize Abeta13-26. Structural parameters (RMSD, helicity) of the peptide were used to assess the performance of the implicit solvent models with reference to previous explicit solvent simulations.",
