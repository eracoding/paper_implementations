    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few studies have analysed long-term effects of immunomodulatory disease modifying drugs (DMDs). OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the efficacy of DMDs on long-term evolution of multiple sclerosis, using a Bayesian approach to overcome methodological problems related to open-label studies. METHODS: MS patients from three different Italian multiple sclerosis centres were divided into subgroups according to the presence of treatment in their disease history before the endpoint, which was represented by secondary progression. Patients were stratified on the basis of the risk score BREMS (Bayesian risk estimate for multiple sclerosis), which is able to predict the unfavourable long-term evolution of MS at an early stage. RESULTS: We analysed data from 1178 patients with a relapsing form of multiple sclerosis at onset and at least 10 years of disease duration, treated (59%) or untreated with DMDs. The risk of secondary progression was significantly lower in patients treated with DMDs, regardless of the initial prognosis predicted by BREMS. CONCLUSIONS: DMDs significantly reduce the risk of multiple sclerosis progression both in patients with initial high-risk and patients with initial low-risk. These findings reinforce the role of DMDs in modifying the natural course of the disease, suggesting that they have a positive effect not only on the inflammatory but also on the neurodegenerative process. The study also confirms the capability of the BREMS score to predict MS evolution.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine whether experiencing a traumatic brain injury (TBI) on a recent combat deployment was associated with postdeployment binge drinking, independent of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: Using the 2008 Department of Defense Survey of Health Related Behaviors among Active Duty Military Personnel, an anonymous survey completed by 28 546 personnel, the study sample included 6824 personnel who had a combat deployment in the past year. Path analysis was used to examine whether PTSD accounted for the total association between TBI and binge drinking. MAIN MEASURES: The dependent variable, binge drinking days, was an ordinal measure capturing the number of times personnel drank 5+ drinks on one occasion (4+ for women) in the past month. Traumatic brain injury level captured the severity of TBI after a combat injury event exposure: TBI-AC (altered consciousness only), TBI-LOC of 20 or less (loss of consciousness up to 20 minutes), and TBI-LOC of more than 20 (loss of consciousness >20 minutes). A PTSD-positive screen relied on the standard diagnostic cutoff of 50+ on the PTSD Checklist-Civilian. RESULTS: The final path model found that while the direct effect of TBI (0.097) on binge drinking was smaller than that of PTSD (0.156), both were significant. Almost 70% of the total effect of TBI on binge drinking was from the direct effect; only 30% represented the indirect effect through PTSD. CONCLUSION: Further research is needed to replicate these findings and to understand the underlying mechanisms that explain the relationship between TBI and increased postdeployment drinking.",

    "title": "Effects of Beta-Amyloid on Resting State Functional Connectivity Within and Between Networks Reflect Known Patterns of Regional Vulnerability.",
    "abstract": "Beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is also present in some cognitively normal elderly adults and may represent a preclinical disease state. While AD patients exhibit disrupted functional connectivity (FC) both within and between resting-state networks, studies of preclinical cases have focused primarily on the default mode network (DMN). The extent to which Abeta-related effects occur outside of the DMN and between networks remains unclear. In the present study, we examine how within- and between-network FC are related to both global and regional Abeta deposition as measured by [(11)C]PIB-PET in 92 cognitively normal older people. We found that within-network FC changes occurred in multiple networks, including the DMN. Changes of between-network FC were also apparent, suggesting that regions maintaining connections to multiple networks may be particularly susceptible to Abeta-induced alterations. Cortical regions showing altered FC clustered in parietal and temporal cortex, areas known to be susceptible to AD pathology. These results likely represent a mix of local network disruption, compensatory reorganization, and impaired control network function. They indicate the presence of Abeta-related dysfunction of neural systems in cognitively normal people well before these areas become hypometabolic with the onset of cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate the pelvic floor muscle (PFM) electromyographic activity in different phases of the female life cycle, correlating electromyographic activity with age, Body Mass Index (BMI), parity as well as the presence and severity of urinary symptoms. METHODS: A clinical, observational, transversal and controlled study was conducted in 384 women: 49 nulliparous, 103 primigravid pregnant, 92 primiparous postpartum (vaginal delivery: n = 43; cesarean section delivery: n = 49), 22 climacteric, 65 postmenopausal, and 53 women identified as being unable to perform voluntary maximum contraction. All subjects were evaluated with digital palpation and PFM surface electromyography (sEMG) and completed the questionnaires: International Consultation on Incontinence Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ IU-SF) and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Overactive Bladder (ICIQ-OAB). Spearman's Correlation Coefficient and ANOVA were used to analyze the variables. RESULTS: The nulliparous women had higher PFM electromyographic activity than the other groups. The primigravid pregnant, cesarean section and vaginal delivery groups had higher electromyographic activity than the postmenopausal group. Studying PFM electromyographic activity with the factors evaluated, a negative correlation between age, parity, and the presence and severity of urinary symptoms was observed. There was no correlation between PFM electromyographic activity and BMI. CONCLUSION: Fourteen percent of women participating were not able to perform active contraction of the PFM. PFM electromyographic activity changed during the female life cycle. PFM electromyographic activity correlated inversely with age, parity, and the presence and severity of urinary symptoms.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The effect of Alzheimer's disease pathology on activity of individual neocortical neurons in the intact neural network remains obscure. Ongoing spontaneous activity, which constitutes most of neocortical activity, is the background template on which further evoked-activity is superimposed. We compared in vivo intracellular recordings and local field potentials (LFP) of ongoing activity in the barrel cortex of APP/PS1 transgenic mice and age-matched littermate CONTROLS, following significant amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation and aggregation. We found that membrane potential dynamics of neurons in Abeta-burdened cortex significantly differed from those of nontransgenic CONTROLS: durations of the depolarized state were considerably shorter, and transitions to that state frequently failed. The spiking properties of APP/PS1 neurons showed alterations from those of CONTROLS: both firing patterns and spike shape were changed in the APP/PS1 group. At the population level, LFP recordings indicated reduced coherence within neuronal assemblies of APP/PS1 mice. In addition to the physiological effects, we show that morphology of neurites within the barrel cortex of the APP/PS1 model is altered compared to CONTROLS. These results are consistent with a process where the effect of Abeta on spontaneous activity of individual neurons amplifies into a network effect, reducing network integrity and leading to a wide cortical dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of memory and cognitive abilities, and the appearance of amyloid plaques composed of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles formed of tau protein. It has been suggested that exercise might ameliorate the disease; here, we evaluated the effect of voluntary running on several aspects of AD including amyloid deposition, tau phosphorylation, inflammatory reaction, neurogenesis and spatial memory in the double transgenic APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mouse model of AD. We report that voluntary wheel running for 10 weeks decreased Abeta burden, Thioflavin-S-positive plaques and Abeta oligomers in the hippocampus. In addition, runner APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice showed fewer phosphorylated tau protein and decreased astrogliosis evidenced by lower staining of GFAP. Further, runner APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice showed increased number of neurons in the hippocampus and exhibited increased cell proliferation and generation of cells positive for the immature neuronal protein doublecortin, indicating that running increased neurogenesis. Finally, runner APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice showed improved spatial memory performance in the Morris water maze. Altogether, our findings indicate that in APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice, voluntary running reduced all the neuropathological hallmarks of AD studied, reduced neuronal loss, increased hippocampal neurogenesis and reduced spatial memory loss. These findings support that voluntary exercise might have therapeutic value on AD.",

    "abstract": "APOE e4, the most significant genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD), may mask effects of other loci. We re-analyzed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) Consortium in APOE e4+ (10 352 cases and 9207 controls) and APOE e4- (7184 cases and 26 968 controls) subgroups as well as in the total sample testing for interaction between a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and APOE e4 status. Suggestive associations (P<1 x 10(-4)) in stage 1 were evaluated in an independent sample (stage 2) containing 4203 subjects (APOE e4+: 1250 cases and 536 controls; APOE e4-: 718 cases and 1699 controls). Among APOE e4- subjects, novel genome-wide significant (GWS) association was observed with 17 SNPs (all between KANSL1 and LRRC37A on chromosome 17 near MAPT) in a meta-analysis of the stage 1 and stage 2 data sets (best SNP, rs2732703, P=5 8 x 10(-9)). Conditional analysis revealed that rs2732703 accounted for association signals in the entire 100-kilobase region that includes MAPT. Except for previously identified AD loci showing stronger association in APOE e4+ subjects (CR1 and CLU) or APOE e4- subjects (MS4A6A/MS4A4A/MS4A6E), no other SNPs were significantly associated with AD in a specific APOE genotype subgroup. In addition, the finding in the stage 1 sample that AD risk is significantly influenced by the interaction of APOE with rs1595014 in TMEM106B (P=1 6 x 10(-7)) is noteworthy, because TMEM106B variants have previously been associated with risk of frontotemporal dementia. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis revealed that rs113986870, one of the GWS SNPs near rs2732703, is significantly associated with four KANSL1 probes that target transcription of the first translated exon and an untranslated exon in hippocampus (P <= 1.3 x 10(-8)), frontal cortex (P <= 1.3 x 10(-9)) and temporal cortex (P<=1.2 x 10(-11)). Rs113986870 is also strongly associated with a MAPT probe that targets transcription of alternatively spliced exon 3 in frontal cortex (P=9.2 x 10(-6)) and temporal cortex (P=2.6 x 10(-6)). Our APOE-stratified GWAS is the first to show GWS association for AD with SNPs in the chromosome 17q21.31 region. Replication of this finding in independent samples is needed to verify that SNPs in this region have significantly stronger effects on AD risk in persons lacking APOE e4 compared with persons carrying this allele, and if this is found to hold, further examination of this region and studies aimed at deciphering the mechanism(s) are warranted.",

    "title": "Interaction of Cigarette Smoking History With APOE Genotype and Age on Amyloid Level, Glucose Metabolism, and Neurocognition in Cognitively Normal Elders.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic cigarette smoking is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The goal of this study was to determine if smoking history moderated the associations of age and APOE genotype (the most robust risk factors for AD) on brain amyloid deposition, glucose metabolism, and neurocognition in cognitively-normal elders. METHODS: Participants (n = 264) were grouped according to their APOE epsilon4 carrier status (epsilon4 carrier: APOE4+; non-epsilon4 carrier: APOE4-) and smoking status (smokers: at least 1 year of smoking during lifetime; never-smokers: no history of smoking). Approximately 89% of the smoking sample was former-smokers. We specifically tested for interactions of smoking status with APOE epsilon4 carrier status and age on measures of cortical amyloid deposition, glucose metabolism, and neurocognition. RESULTS: (1) smoking status interacted with APOE epsilon4 carrier status, where smoker APOE4+ showed lower glucose metabolism and poorer auditory-verbal learning and memory than never-smoking APOE4-, never-smoking APOE4+, and smoking APOE4-; (2) smoking status interacted with age on measures of semantic fluency, processing speed/set-shifting and global neurocognition; smokers, irrespective of APOE epsilon4 carrier status, demonstrated poorer performance with increasing age than never-smokers; and (3) smoking APOE4+ and never-smoking APOE4+ showed greater cortical amyloid deposition than never-smoking APOE4- and smoking APOE4-. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate consideration of smoking history is essential to both better understand the factors associated with neurobiological and neurocognitive abnormalities in elders, and the risk for development of AD-related neuropathology.",

    "title": "The blood clotting Factor XIIIa forms unique complexes with amyloid-beta (Abeta) and colocalizes with deposited Abeta in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a key pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) characterized by accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein in blood vessel walls. CAA impairs vessel functioning, affects blood brain barrier integrity and accelerates cognitive decline of AD patients. Unfortunately, mechanisms underlying Abeta deposition in the vessel wall remain largely unknown. Factor XIIIa (FXIIIa) is a blood-derived transglutaminase crucial in blood coagulation by cross-linking fibrin molecules. Evidence is mounting that blood-derived factors are present in CAA and may play a role in protein deposition in the vessel wall. We therefore investigated whether FXIIIa is present in CAA and if FXIIIa cross-link activity affects Abeta aggregation. METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of FXIIIa, its activator thrombin and in situ FXIIIa activity in CAA in post-mortem AD tissue. We used surface plasmon resonance and Western blot analysis to study binding of FXIIIa to Abeta and the formation of FXIIIa-Abeta complexes, respectively. In addition, we studied cytotoxicity of FXIIIa-Abeta complexes to cerebrovascular cells. RESULTS: FXIIIa, thrombin and in situ FXIIIa activity colocalize with the Abeta deposition in CAA. Furthermore, FXIIIa binds to Abeta with a higher binding affinity for Abeta1-42 compared with Abeta1-40 . Moreover, highly stable FXIIIa-Abeta complexes are formed independently of FXIIIa cross-linking activity that protected cerebrovascular cells from Abeta-induced toxicity in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that FXIIIa colocalizes with Abeta in CAA and that FXIIIa forms unique protein complexes with Abeta that might play an important role in Abeta deposition and persistence in the vessel wall.",

    "title": "ATP leakage induces P2XR activation and contributes to acute synaptic excitotoxicity induced by soluble oligomers of beta-amyloid peptide in hippocampal neurons.",
    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that the toxic effects of Abeta can be attributed to its capability to insert in membranes and form pore-like structures, which are permeable to cations and molecules such as ATP. Our working hypothesis is that Abeta increases extracellular ATP causing activation of P2X receptors and potentiating excitatory synaptic activity. We found that soluble oligomers of beta-amyloid peptide increased cytosolic Ca(2+) 4-fold above control (415 +- 28% of control). Also, ATP leakage (157 +- 10% of control) was independent of extracellular Ca(2+), suggesting that ATP traveled from the cytosol through an Abeta pore-mediated efflux and not from exocytotic mechanisms. The subsequent activation of P2XR by ATP can contribute to the cytosolic Ca(2+) increase observed with Abeta. Additionally, we found that beta-amyloid oligomers bind preferentially to excitatory neurons inducing an increase in excitatory synaptic current frequency (248.1 +- 32.7%) that was blocked by the use of P2XR antagonists such as PPADS (Abeta + PPADS: 110.9 +- 18.35%) or Apyrase plus DPCPX (Abeta + inhibitors: 98.97 +- 17.4%). Taken together, we suggest that Abeta induces excitotoxicity by binding preferentially to excitatory neuron membranes forming a non-selective pore and by increasing intracellular calcium by itself and through P2XR activation by extracellular ATP leading to an augmention in mEPSC activity. All these effects were blocked with a non-specific P2XR antagonist, indicating that part of the neurotoxicity of Abeta is mediated by P2XR activation and facilitation of excitatory neurotransmitter release. These findings suggest that P2XR can be considered as a potential new target for the development of drugs or pharmacological tools to treat Alzheimer's disease.

Using attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared and solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we find that the Abeta peptide experiences a remarkable conformational switch from beta to alpha secondary structure upon solvent removal by lyophilization of oligomers. This transition is, contrary to Abeta fibrils, independent of concentration of organic co-solvents or co-solutes and is reversible upon re-addition of the solvent. Our data illuminate a previously unnoted secondary structural plasticity of the Abeta peptide in amyloid oligomers that could bear relevance for Abeta's interactions with cellular structures of low polarity.",

Information on the mass, stability, cross-sectional area and ligand binding capability of each transiently populated intermediate, present in the heterogeneous mixture of assembling species, can be determined individually in a single experiment in real-time. Determining the structural characterisation of oligomeric species and alterations in self-assembly pathways observed in the presence of small molecule inhibitors is of great importance, given the urgent demand for effective therapeutics. Recent studies have demonstrated the capability of ESI-IMS-MS to identify small molecule modulators of amyloid assembly and to determine the mechanism by which they interact (positive, negative, non-specific binding, or colloidal) in a high-throughput format. Here, we demonstrate these advances using self-assembly of Abeta40 as an example, and reveal two new inhibitors of Abeta40 fibrillation.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial biogenesis is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial content, morphology, and function. Impaired mitochondrial biogenesis has been observed in Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) has been shown to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured neurons, but its role in mitochondrial biogenesis in neurons remains poorly defined. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) are key energy-sensing molecules regulating mitochondrial biogenesis. In addition, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1alpha), the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, is a target for SIRT1 deacetylase activity. In this study, we investigated the effects of Abeta25-35 on mitochondrial biogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons and the underlying mechanisms. In primary hippocampal neurons, we found that 24-h incubation with Abeta25-35 suppressed both phosphorylations of AMPK and SIRT1 expression and increased PGC-1alpha acetylation expression. In addition, Abeta25-35 also resulted in a decrease in mitochondrial DNA copy number, as well as decreases in the expression of mitochondrial biogenesis factors (PGC-1alpha, NRF 1, NRF 2, and Tfam). Taken together, these data show that Abeta25-35 suppresses mitochondrial biogenesis in hippocampal neurons. Abeta25-35-induced impairment of mitochondrial biogenesis may be associated with the inhibition of the AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1alpha pathway.",

CONCLUSIONS: The meeting made recommendations to promote computational pathology, including clearly defining the field and articulating its value propositions; asserting that the value propositions for health care systems must include means to incorporate robust computational approaches to implement data-driven methods that aid in guiding individual and population health care; leveraging computational pathology as a center for data interpretation in modern health care systems; stating that realizing the value proposition will require working with institutional administrations, other departments, and pathology colleagues; declaring that a robust pipeline should be fostered that trains and develops future computational pathologists, for those with both pathology and nonpathology backgrounds; and deciding that computational pathology should serve as a hub for data-related research in health care systems. The dissemination of these recommendations to pathology and bioinformatics departments should help facilitate the development of computational pathology.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To identify computer extracted in vivo dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI markers associated with quantitative histomorphometric (QH) characteristics of microvessels and Gleason scores (GS) in prostate cancer. METHODS: This study considered retrospective data from 23 biopsy confirmed prostate cancer patients who underwent 3 Tesla multiparametric MRI before radical prostatectomy (RP). Representative slices from RP specimens were stained with vascular marker CD31. Tumor extent was mapped from RP sections onto DCE MRI using nonlinear registration methods. Seventy-seven microvessel QH features and 18 DCE MRI kinetic features were extracted and evaluated for their ability to distinguish low from intermediate and high GS. The effect of temporal sampling on kinetic features was assessed and correlations between those robust to temporal resolution and microvessel features discriminative of GS were examined. RESULTS: A total of 12 microvessel architectural features were discriminative of low and intermediate/high grade tumors with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) > 0.7. These features were most highly correlated with mean washout gradient (WG) (max rho = -0.62). Independent analysis revealed WG to be moderately robust to temporal resolution (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.63) and WG variance, which was poorly correlated with microvessel features, to be predictive of low grade tumors (AUC = 0.77). Enhancement ratio was the most robust (ICC = 0.96) and discriminative (AUC = 0.78) kinetic feature but was moderately correlated with microvessel features (max rho = -0.52). CONCLUSION: Computer extracted features of prostate DCE MRI appear to be correlated with microvessel architecture and may be discriminative of low versus intermediate and high GS.",

    "title": "The Distinct Role of ADAM17 in APP Proteolysis and Microglial Activation Related to Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with the symptom of cognitive impairment. The deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide is believed to be the primary cause to neuronal dystrophy and eventually dementia. Abeta is the proteolytic product from its precursor amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma- secretase. An optional cleavage by alpha-secretase happens inside the Abeta domain. ADAM17 is supposed to be the regulated alpha-secretase of APP. Enhanced activity of ADAM17 leads to the increasing secretion of neuroprotective soluble APP alpha fragment and reduction of Abeta generation, which may be benefit to the disease. ADAM17 is then considered the potential therapeutic target for AD. Microglia activation and neuroinflammation is another important event in AD pathogenesis. Interestingly, ADAM17 also participates in the cleavage of many other membrane-bound proteins, especially some inflammatory factors related to microglia activation. The facilitating role of ADAM17 in inflammation and further neuronal damage has also been illustrated. In results, the activation of ADAM17 as the solution to AD may be a tricky task. The comprehensive consideration and evaluation has to be carried out carefully before the final treatment. In the present review, the distinct role of ADAM17 in AD-related APP shedding and neuroinflammatory microglial activation will be carefully discussed.",

METHODS: One-hundred forty-two patients with PEX have been included for this study; median age: 75 years (Q1 = 71,5; Q3 = 80,0). Control group comprised 93 subjects aged 74 years (Q1 = 68,0; Q3 = 80,0). Amyloid beta-40 and beta-42 (Abeta-40, Abeta-42) concentrations were assessed in plasma in 73 PEX patients and 49 controls. Abeta-40 concentration in aqueous humor was measured in 31 patients from each group. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clock Drawing Tests were performed in 83 PEX patients and 36 controls. RESULTS: The differences between amyloid concentrations both in plasma and in aqueous humor in PEX and control groups were not statistically significant. There were no differences in MMSE and Clock Drawing Tests between groups. CONCLUSION: Our results do not indicate any relation between PEX and Alzheimer's amyloids or cognitive functions in cataract patients.",

    "abstract": "beta-Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its cleaved products are strongly implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Endosomes are highly active APP processing sites, and endosome anomalies associated with upregulated expression of early endosomal regulator, rab5, are the earliest known disease-specific neuronal response in AD. Here, we show that the rab5 effector APPL1 (adaptor protein containing pleckstrin homology domain, phosphotyrosine binding domain and leucine zipper motif) mediates rab5 overactivation in Down syndrome (DS) and AD, which is caused by elevated levels of the beta-cleaved carboxy-terminal fragment of APP (betaCTF). betaCTF recruits APPL1 to rab5 endosomes, where it stabilizes active GTP-rab5, leading to pathologically accelerated endocytosis, endosome swelling and selectively impaired axonal transport of rab5 endosomes. In DS fibroblasts, APPL1 knockdown corrects these endosomal anomalies. betaCTF levels are also elevated in AD brain, which is accompanied by abnormally high recruitment of APPL1 to rab5 endosomes as seen in DS fibroblasts. These studies indicate that persistent rab5 overactivation through betaCTF-APPL1 interactions constitutes a novel APP-dependent pathogenic pathway in AD.",

However, there is a great need for standardization of methods used for quantification. To overcome problems associated with immunoassays, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has emerged as a critical orthogonal alternative. METHODS: We compared results for CSF Abeta42 quantification in a round robin study performed in four laboratories using similar sample preparation methods and LC-MS instrumentation. RESULTS: The LC-MS results showed excellent correlation between laboratories (r(2) >0.98), high analytical precision, and good correlation with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (r(2) >0.85). The use of a common reference sample further decreased interlaboratory variation. DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that LC-MS is suitable for absolute quantification of Abeta42 in CSF and highlight the importance of developing a certified reference material.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown significant changes in amyloid-beta (Abeta) transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) under diabetic conditions with hypoinsulinemia, which is involved in diabetes-associated cognitive impairment. Present study employed db/db mice with hyperinsulinemia to investigate changes in Abeta transport across the BBB, hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and restorative effects of antidiabetic drugs. Our results showed that db/db mice exhibited similar changes in Abeta transport across the BBB to that of insulin-deficient mice. Chronic treatment of db/db mice with antidiabetic drugs such as metformin, glibenclamide and insulin glargine significantly decreased Abeta influx across the BBB determined by intra-arterial infusion of (125)I-Abeta(1-40), and expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) participating in Abeta influx. Insulin glargine, but not, metformin or glibenclamide increased Abeta efflux across the BBB determined by stereotaxic intra-cerebral infusion of (125)I-Abeta(1-40), and expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1) participating in Abeta efflux. Moreover, treatment with these drugs significantly decreased hippocampal Abeta(1-40) or Abeta(1-42) and inhibited neuronal apoptosis. The drugs also ameliorated memory impairment confirmed by improved performance on behavioral tasks. However, insulin glargine or glibenclamide, but not metformin, restored hippocampal synaptic plasticity characterized by enhancing in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP). Further study found that these three drugs significantly restrained NF-kappaB, but only insulin glargine enhanced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) activity at the BBB in db/db mice. Our data indicate that the antidiabetic drugs can partially restore abnormal Abeta transport across the BBB and memory impairment under diabetic context.",

Primary findings for both studies have been published. METHODS: Secondary analyses of efficacy, biomarker, and safety endpoints in the pooled (EXPEDTION + EXPEDITION2) mild AD population were performed. RESULTS: In the mild AD population, less cognitive and functional decline was observed with solanezumab (n = 659) versus placebo (n = 663), measured by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living functional scale Instrumental ADLs. Baseline-to-endpoint changes did not differ between treatment groups for Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living functional scale, basic items of the ADCS-ADL, and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes. Plasma/cerebrospinal fluid biomarker findings indicated target engagement by solanezumab. Solanezumab demonstrated acceptable safety.

    "abstract": "Neuronal membrane damage is related to the early impairments appearing in Alzheimer's disease due to the interaction of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) with the phospholipid bilayer. In particular, the ganglioside GM1, present with cholesterol in lipid rafts, seems to be able to initiate Abeta aggregation on membrane. We studied the thermodynamic and structural effects of the presence of GM1 on the interaction between Abeta and liposomes, a good membrane model system. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry highlighted the importance of the presence of GM1 in recruiting monomeric Abeta toward the lipid bilayer. Light and Small Angle X-ray Scattering revealed a different pattern for GM1 containing liposomes, both before and after interaction with Abeta. The results suggest that the interaction with GM1 brings to insertion of Abeta in the bilayer, producing a structural perturbation down to the internal layers of the liposome, as demonstrated by the obtained electron density profiles.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate utility of the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) in a mixed sample of adults with neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. METHOD: Cross-sectional, interview-based study. Participants were community-dwelling adults with disabilities resulting from neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders (N = 54), who participated in a pre-vocational readiness and social skills training program. Psychometric properties of the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) were assessed and validated against Mayo-Portland Adaptability Inventory (MPAI) and The Problem Checklist from the New York University Head Injury Family Interview (PCL). RESULTS: Based on the revised scoring procedures, psychometric properties of the CIQ Home Competency scale were excellent, followed by the Total score and Social Integration scale. Productive Activity scale had low content validity and a weak association with the total score. Convergent and discriminant validity of the CIQ were demonstrated by correlation patterns with MPAI scales in the expected direction. Significant relationship was found with PCL Physical/Dependency scale. Significant associations were found with sex, living status, and record of subsequent employment. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide support for the use of the CIQ as a measure of participation in individuals with neurological and neuropsychiatric diagnoses and resulting disabilities. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: An important goal of rehabilitation and training programs for individuals with dysfunction of the central nervous system is to promote their participation in social, vocational, and domestic activities. The Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) is a brief and efficient instrument for measuring these participation domains. This study demonstrated good psychometric properties and high utility of the CIQ in a sample of 54 individuals participating in a prevocational training program.",

    "abstract": "Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is an important enzyme for detoxication and metabolism of ester compounds. It also hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in pathological conditions and may play a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We here compared the learning ability and vulnerability to Abeta toxicity in male and female BChE knockout (KO) mice and their 129Sv wild-type (Wt) controls. Animals tested for place learning in the water-maze showed increased acquisition slopes and presence in the training quadrant during the probe test. An increased passive avoidance response was also observed for males. BChE KO mice therefore showed enhanced learning ability in spatial and non-spatial memory tests. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of increasing doses of amyloid-beta[25-35] (Abeta25-35) peptide oligomers resulted, in Wt mice, in learning and memory deficits, oxidative stress and decrease in ACh hippocampal content. In BChE KO mice, the Abeta25-35-induced deficit in place learning was attenuated in males and blocked in females. No change in lipid peroxidation or ACh levels was observed after Abeta25-35 treatment in male or female BChE KO mice. These data showed that the genetic invalidation of BChE in mice augmented learning capacities and lowered the vulnerability to Abeta toxicity.",

    "abstract": "The most common causes of cognitive impairment and dementia are Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular brain injury (VBI), either independently, in combination, or in conjunction with other neurodegenerative disorders. The contribution of VBI to cognitive impairment and dementia, particularly in the context of AD pathology, has been examined extensively yet remains difficult to characterize due to conflicting results. Describing the relative contribution and mechanisms of VBI in dementia is important because of the profound impact of dementia on individuals, caregivers, families, and society, particularly the stability of health care systems with the rapidly increasing age of our population. Here we discuss relationships between pathologic processes of VBI and clinical expression of dementia, specific subtypes of VBI including microvascular brain injury, and what is currently known regarding contributions of VBI to the development and pathogenesis of the dementia syndrome.

    "abstract": "Understanding how midlife risk factors influence age at onset (AAO) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) may provide clues to delay disease expression. Although midlife adiposity predicts increased incidence of AD, it is unclear whether it affects AAO and severity of Alzheimer's neuropathology. Using a prospective population-based cohort, Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), this study aims to examine the relationships between midlife body mass index (BMI) and (1) AAO of AD (2) severity of Alzheimer's neuropathology and (3) fibrillar brain amyloid deposition during aging. We analyzed data on 1394 cognitively normal individuals at baseline (8643 visits; average follow-up interval 13.9 years), among whom 142 participants developed incident AD. In two subsamples of BLSA, 191 participants underwent autopsy and neuropathological assessment, and 75 non-demented individuals underwent brain amyloid imaging. Midlife adiposity was derived from BMI data at 50 years of age. We find that each unit increase in midlife BMI predicts earlier onset of AD by 6.7 months (P=0.013). Higher midlife BMI was associated with greater Braak neurofibrillary but not CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease) neuritic plaque scores at autopsy overall. Associations between midlife BMI and brain amyloid burden approached statistical significance. Thus, higher midlife BMI was also associated with greater fibrillar amyloid measured by global mean cortical distribution volume ratio (P=0.075) and within the precuneus (left, P=0.061; right, P=0.079). In conclusion, midlife overweight predicts earlier onset of AD and greater burden of Alzheimer's neuropathology. A healthy BMI at midlife may delay the onset of AD.",

    "abstract": "Low CSF beta-amyloid 1-42 has been associated with cognitive decline in advanced Parkinson's disease; data from a single cohort suggest beta-amyloid 1-42 may be an early marker of cognitive impairment. Newly diagnosed Parkinson's participants (mean duration, 6.9 months) in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (n = 341) were assessed at baseline (untreated state) and followed for 2 years. CSF beta-amyloid 1-42, alpha-synuclein, total tau, and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 were collected at baseline. Participants were classified as having cognitive impairment (CI) if scores on two of six cognitive tests were 1.5 standard deviations below the standardized mean based on published norms in healthy controls. Multivariable regression analyses were used to determine the association between baseline CSF markers with cognitive impairment, defined by neuropsychological testing performance at 2-year follow-up. Fifty-five participants (16.1 %) had CI at baseline and were not included in further analyses. Thirty-seven of the 286 participants without CI at baseline (12.9 %) developed CI at 2 years. Participants with CI at 2 years had significantly lower mean baseline CSF beta-amyloid 1-42 levels than non-CI participants (343.8 vs. 380.4 pg/mL, p < 0.01); no significant difference was seen for alpha-synuclein, T-tau, or P-tau 181. In a regression model of 286 participants without baseline CI adjusted for age, gender, disease duration, education, motor severity, and depression status, lower baseline beta-amyloid 1-42 levels were associated with higher odds of CI at 2 years. (OR(10pg/mL) = 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.08, p < 0.05). CSF beta-amyloid 1-42 level at disease onset is an independent predictor of cognitive impairment in early Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to develop a hybrid three-dimensional-tissue engineering construct for chondrogenesis. The hypothesis was that they support chondrogenesis. A biodegradable, highly porous polycaprolactone-grate was produced by solid freeform fabrication. The polycaprolactone support was coated with a chitosan/polyethylene oxide nanofibre sheet produced by electrospinning. Transforming growth factor-beta3-induced chondrogenesis was followed using the following markers: sex determining region Y/-box 9, runt-related transcription factor 2 and collagen II and X in quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, histology and immunostaining. A polycaprolactone-grate and an optimized chitosan/polyethylene oxide nanofibre sheet supported cellular aggregation, chondrogenesis and matrix formation. In tissue engineering constructs, the sheets were seeded first with mesenchymal stem cells and then piled up according to the lasagne principle. The advantages of such a construct are (1) the cells do not need to migrate to the tissue engineering construct and therefore pore size and interconnectivity problems are omitted and (2) the cell-tight nanofibre sheet and collagen-fibre network mimic a cell culture platform for mesenchymal stem cells/chondrocytes (preventing escape) and hinders in-growth of fibroblasts and fibrous scarring (preventing capture). This allows time for the slowly progressing, multiphase true cartilage regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Excessive accumulation and deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) has been considered as a pivotal event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuronal apoptosis is one of the characteristics of AD, which is a possible mechanism underlying Abeta-induced neuronal neurotoxicity. Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a newly discovered vertebrate heme protein that exhibits neuroprotective functions against cell death associated with hypoxic and amyloid insult. However, until now, the exact mechanism of neuroglobin's protective action has not been determined. To investigate the potential neuroprotective roles and mechanisms of Ngb, transgenic AD mice (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) and SH-SY5Y cells transfected with pAPPswe were enrolled into the study. In vivo, overexpression of Ngb via intracerebroventricular injection with pNgb attenuated memory, cognitive impairment, and plaque generations. In pAPPswe transfected SH-SY5Y cells, Ngb not only decreased the generation of Abeta42, but also attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis through suppressing the activation of caspase-3, caspase-9 by Akt activating phosphorylation, which were restrained by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (LY294002). Our data indicate the anti-apoptotic property of Ngb may play a neuroprotective role against AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia among elderly population. AD is characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, which aggregate over time to form amyloid plaques in the brain. Reducing soluble Abeta levels and consequently amyloid plaques constitute an attractive therapeutic avenue to, at least, stabilize AD pathogenesis. The brain possesses several mechanisms involved in controlling cerebral Abeta levels, among which are the tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA)/plasmin system and microglia. However, these mechanisms are impaired and ineffective in AD. Here we show that the systemic chronic administration of recombinant t-PA (Activase rt-PA) attenuates AD-related pathology in APPswe/PS1 transgenic mice by reducing cerebral Abeta levels and improving the cognitive function of treated mice. Interestingly, these effects do not appear to be mediated by rt-PA-induced plasmin and matrix metalloproteinases 2/9 activation. We observed that rt-PA essentially mediated a slight transient increase in the frequency of patrolling monocytes in the circulation and stimulated microglia in the brain to adopt a neuroprotective phenotype, both of which contribute to Abeta elimination. Our study unraveled a new role of rt-PA in maintaining the phagocytic capacity of microglia without exacerbating the inflammatory response and therefore might constitute an interesting approach to stimulate the key populations of cells involved in Abeta clearance from the brain.",

Decreasing the levels of Abeta oligomer, glial activation and oxidative stress are potential therapeutic approaches for AD treatment.

However, whether alpha-TQ ameliorates memory deficits and other neuropathologies in mice or patients with AD remains unknown. In this study, we reported that orally administered alpha-TQ ameliorated memory impairment in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice, decreased oxidative stress and the levels of Abeta oligomer in the brains of mice, prevented the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase and inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 and interleukin-1beta, and inhibited microglial activation by inhibiting NF-kappaB signaling pathway.

    "abstract": "The excitatory amino acid transporters 1 and 2 (EAAT1 and EAAT2), mostly located on astrocytes, are the main mediators for glutamate clearance in humans. Malfunctions of these transporters may lead to excessive glutamate accumulation and subsequent excitotoxicity to neurons, which has been implicated in many kinds of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, the specific mechanism of the glutamate system dysregulation remains vague. To explore whether the insulin/protein kinase B (Akt)/EAAT signaling in human astrocytes could be disturbed by beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) and be protected by insulin, we incubated HA-1800 cells with varying concentrations of Abeta1-42 oligomers and insulin. Then the alterations of several key substrates in this signal transduction pathway were determined. Our results showed that expressions of insulin receptor, phospho-insulin receptor, phospho-protein kinase B, phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin, and EAAT1 and EAAT2 were decreased by the Abeta1-42 oligomers in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05) and this trend could be recovered by insulin treatment (p < 0.05). However, the expressions of total Akt and mTOR were invariant (p > 0.05), and the mRNA levels of EAAT1 and EAAT2 were also unchanged (p > 0.05). Taken together, this study indicates that Abeta1-42 oligomers could cause disturbances in insulin/Akt/EAAT signaling in astrocytes, which might be responsible for AD onset and progression. Additionally, insulin can exert protective functions to the brain by modulating protein modifications or expressions.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia associated with progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. Extracellular beta-amyloid (Abeta) is a major constituent of senile plaques, one of the pathological hallmarks of AD. Abeta deposition causes neuronal death via a number of possible mechanisms such as increasing oxidative stress. Therefore therapeutic approaches to identify novel Abeta aggregate reducers could be effective for AD treatment. Using a Trx-His-Abeta biochemical assay, we screened 11 synthetic indolylquinoline compounds, and found NC009-1, -2, -6 and -7 displaying potential to reduce Abeta aggregation. Treating Tet-On Abeta-GFP 293 cells with these compounds reduced Abeta aggregation and reactive oxygen species. These compounds also promoted neurite outgrowth in Tet-On Abeta-GFP SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, treatment with above compounds improved neuronal cell viability, neurite outgrowth, and synaptophysin expression level in mouse hippocampal primary culture under oligomeric Abeta-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, the tested NC009-1 significantly ameliorated Abeta-induced inhibition of hippocampal long-term potentiation in mouse hippocampal slices. Our results demonstrate how synthetic indolylquinoline compounds are likely to work as chemical chaperones in Abeta-aggregation reduction and neuroprotection, providing insight into the possible applications of indolylquinoline compounds in AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Several studies have explored the use of serum procalcitonin (PCT) in differentiating between bacterial and viral etiologies in children with suspected meningitis. We pooled these studies into a meta-analysis to determine the PCT diagnostic accuracy. All major databases were searched through March 2015. No date or language restrictions were applied. Eight studies (n = 616 pediatric patients) were included. Serum PCT assay was found to be very accurate for differentiating the etiology of pediatric meningitis with pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.96 (95% CI = 0.92-0.98) and 0.89 (95% CI = 0.86-0.92), respectively. The pooled positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) for PCT were 7.5 (95% CI = 5.6-10.1), 0.08(95% CI = 0.04-0.14), 142.3 (95% CI = 59.5-340.4), and 0.97 (SE = 0.01), respectively. In 6 studies, PCT was found to be superior than CRP, whose DOR was only 16.7 (95%CI = 8.8-31.7). Our meta-analysis demonstrates that serum PCT assay is a highly accurate and powerful test for rapidly differentiating between bacterial and viral meningitis in children.",

    "title": "Pharmacokinetic Properties of a Novel D-Peptide Developed to be Therapeutically Active Against Toxic beta-Amyloid Oligomers.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: It has been shown that amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers play an important role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). D3, a peptide consisting solely of D-enantiomeric amino acid residues, was developed to specifically eliminate Abeta oligomers and is therapeutically active in transgenic AD mice. D-peptides have several advantages over L-peptides, but little is known about their pharmacokinetic potential in vivo. Here, we analysed the pharmacokinetic properties of RD2, a rationally designed and potent D3 derivative. METHODS: The pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using (3)H-RD2 after administration via several routes in mice. The time dependent amount of radiolabelled RD2 was measured in plasma and several organ homogenates by liquid scintillation counting. Furthermore, binding to plasma proteins was estimated. RESULTS: RD2 penetrates into the brain, where it is thought to implement its therapeutic function. All administration routes result in a maximal brain concentration per dose (Cmax/D) of 0.06 (mug/g)/(mg/kg) with brain/plasma ratios ranging between 0.7 and 1.0. RD2 shows a small elimination constant and a long terminal half-life in plasma of more than 2 days. It also exhibits high bioavailability after i.p., s.c. or p.o. administration. CONCLUSIONS: These excellent pharmacokinetic properties confirm that RD2 is a very promising drug candidate for AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain and in the walls of cerebral arteries. The focus of this work is on clearance of Abeta along artery walls, the failure of which may explain the accumulation of Abeta in Alzheimer's disease. Periarterial basement membranes form continuous channels from cerebral capillaries to major arteries on the surface of the brain. Arterial pressure pulses drive peristaltic flow in the basement membranes in the same direction as blood flow. Here we forward the hypothesis that flexible structures within the basement membrane, if oriented such they present greater resistance to forward than retrograde flow, may cause net reverse flow, advecting Abeta along with it. A solution was obtained for peristaltic flow with low Reynolds number, long wavelength compared to channel height and small channel height compared to vessel radius in a Darcy-Brinkman medium representing a square array of cylinders. Results show that retrograde flow is promoted by high cylinder volume fraction and low peristaltic amplitude. A decrease in cylinder concentration and/or an increase in amplitude, both of which may occur during ageing, can reduce retrograde flow or even cause a transition from retrograde to forward flow. Such changes may explain the accumulation of Abeta in the brain and in artery walls in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence suggests that nutraceuticals with prolongevity properties may delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We recently demonstrated that a proanthocyanidins-standardized cranberry extract has properties that prolong life span and promote innate immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans In this article, we report that supplementation of this cranberry extract delayed Abeta toxicity-triggered body paralysis in the C elegans AD model. Genetic analyses indicated that the cranberry-mediated Abeta toxicity alleviation required heat shock transcription factor (HSF)-1 rather than DAF-16 and SKN-1. Moreover, cranberry supplementation increased the transactivity of HSF-1 in an IIS-dependent manner. Further studies found that the cranberry extract relies on HSF-1 to significantly enhance the solubility of proteins in aged worms, implying an improved proteostasis in AD worms. Considering that HSF-1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining proteostasis, our results suggest that cranberry maintains the function of proteostasis through HSF-1, thereby protecting C elegans against Abeta toxicity. Together, our findings elucidated the mechanism whereby cranberry attenuated Abeta toxicity in C elegans and stressed the significance of proteostasis in the prevention of age-related diseases from a practical point of view.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Brain amyloid deposition is one of the key pathological hallmarks underlying the cognitive changes associated with Alzheimer's disease. Growing interest has been given to the earliest clinical manifestations of amyloid plaques. However, the relationship between amyloid status and activities of everyday function remains largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the relationship between instrumental activities of daily living performance (using the ADL-PI score) and amyloid status in older adults. METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses of data from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT) were performed. Volunteers underwent a brain 18F-AV45 positron emission tomography examination. Bivariate analysis and regression models were conducted to study the relationships between brain amyloid deposition and the total ADL-PI score. RESULTS: We included 271 participants (women = 60%; age = 76+-4 years). Amyloid positron emission tomography was positive (standard uptake value >=1.17) for 103 participants (38%). The ADL-PI score was lower in amyloid positive participants than in their amyloid negative counterparts (38.8 vs 40.3, p = .007). This association was also confirmed in regression models adjusted for age, gender, and familial history of Alzheimer's disease (odds ratio = 0.94; 95% confidence interval 0.89-0.99; p = .02). This finding was consistent in cognitively normal individuals and in those with mild cognitive impairment, using the clinical dementia rating scale. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted an association between early functional limitations and brain amyloid deposition in elderly subjects. These symptoms could be the clinical manifestations of amyloid plaques even in the absence of overt dementia. Further prospective studies are warranted for examining the evolution of ADL-PI score over the course of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Glimepiride protects neurons against amyloid-beta-induced synapse damage.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is associated with the accumulation within the brain of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides that damage synapses and affect memory acquisition. This process can be modelled by observing the effects of Abeta on synapses in cultured neurons. The addition of picomolar concentrations of soluble Abeta derived from brain extracts triggered the loss of synaptic proteins including synaptophysin, synapsin-1 and cysteine string protein from cultured neurons. Glimepiride, a sulphonylurea used for the treatment of diabetes, protected neurons against synapse damage induced by Abeta. The protective effects of glimepiride were multi-faceted. Glimepiride treatment was associated with altered synaptic membranes including the loss of specific glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins including the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) that acts as a receptor for Abeta42, increased synaptic gangliosides and altered cell signalling. More specifically, glimepiride reduced the Abeta-induced increase in cholesterol and the Abeta-induced activation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) in synapses that occurred within cholesterol-dense membrane rafts. Abeta42 binding to glimepiride-treated neurons was not targeted to membrane rafts and less Abeta42 accumulated within synapses. These studies indicate that glimepiride modified the membrane micro-environments in which Abeta-induced signalling leads to synapse damage. In addition, soluble PrP(C), released from neurons by glimepiride, neutralised Abeta-induced synapse damage. Such observations raise the possibility that glimepiride may reduce synapse damage and hence delay the progression of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Caregiver burden in atypical dementias: comparing frontotemporal dementia, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Caregiver burden is a significant issue in the treatment of dementia and a known contributor to institutionalization of patients with dementia. Published data have documented increased caregiver burden in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) compared to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Another atypical dementia with high-perceived caregiver burden is sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), but no formal studies have assessed this perception. The aim of this study was to compare caregiver burden across atypical dementia etiologies. METHODS: 76 adults with atypical dementia (young-onset AD [YOAD], bvFTD, language variant FTD [lvFTD], and sCJD) were administered an abbreviated version of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-Q), and other assessment instruments during a five-year time period at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH). A Cox regression model examined differences between disease categories that impact mean ZBI scores. RESULTS: Mean ZBI scores were significantly different between dementia etiologies, with bvFTD and sCJD having the highest caregiver burden (p = 0.026). Mean NPI-Q caregiver distress scores were highest in bvFTD and sCJD (p = 0.002), with sCJD and bvFTD also having the highest number of endorsed symptom domains (p = 0.012). On regression analyses, an interactive variable combining final diagnosis category and NPI-Q total severity score demonstrated statistically significant differences in mean ZBI scores for sCJD and bvFTD. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that bvFTD and sCJD have increased levels of caregiver burden, NPI-Q caregiver distress, total severity scores, and number of endorsed symptom domains. These results suggest that higher caregiver burden in bvFTD and sCJD are disease specific and possibly related to neuropsychiatric symptoms.",

    "title": "Mechanism of C-Terminal Fragments of Amyloid beta-Protein as Abeta Inhibitors: Do C-Terminal Interactions Play a Key Role in Their Inhibitory Activity?",
    "abstract": "Targeting the early oligomerization of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is a promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, certain C-terminal fragments (CTFs) derived from Abeta42 were shown to be potent inhibitors of Abeta-induced toxicity. The shortest peptide studied, Abeta(39-42), has been shown to modulate Abeta oligomerization and inhibit Abeta toxicity. Understanding the mechanism of these CTFs, especially Abeta(39-42), is of significance for future therapeutic development of AD and peptidomimetic-based drug development. Here we used ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry to investigate the interactions between two modified Abeta(39-42) derivatives, VVIA-NH2 and Ac-VVIA, and full-length Abeta42. VVIA-NH2 was previously shown to inhibit Abeta toxicity, whereas Ac-VVIA did not. Our mass spectrometry analysis revealed that VVIA-NH2 binds directly to Abeta42 monomer and small oligomers while Ac-VVIA binds only to Abeta42 monomer. Ion mobility studies showed that VVIA-NH2 modulates Abeta42 oligomerization by not only inhibiting the dodecamer formation but also disaggregating preformed Abeta42 dodecamer. Ac-VVIA also inhibits and removes preformed Abeta42 dodecamer. However, the Abeta42 sample with the addition of Ac-VVIA clogged the nanospray tip easily, indicating that larger aggregates are formed in the solution in the presence of Ac-VVIA. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that VVIA-NH2 binds specifically to the C-terminal region of Abeta42 while Ac-VVIA binds dispersedly to multiple regions of Abeta42. This work implies that C-terminal interactions and binding to Abeta oligomers are important for C-terminal fragment inhibitors.",

    "title": "Spatial patterns of atrophy, hypometabolism, and amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease correspond to dissociable functional brain networks.",
    "abstract": "Recent neuroimaging studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have emphasized topographical similarities between AD-related brain changes and a prominent cortical association network called the default-mode network (DMN). However, the specificity of distinct imaging abnormalities for the DMN compared to other intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) of the limbic and heteromodal association cortex has not yet been examined systematically. We assessed regional amyloid load using AV45-PET, neuronal metabolism using FDG-PET, and gray matter volume using structural MRI in 473 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, including preclinical, predementia, and clinically manifest AD stages. Complementary region-of-interest and voxel-based analyses were used to assess disease stage- and modality-specific changes within seven principle ICNs of the human brain as defined by a standardized functional connectivity atlas. Amyloid deposition in AD dementia showed a preference for the DMN, but high effect sizes were also observed for other neocortical ICNs, most notably the frontoparietal-control network. Atrophic changes were most specific for an anterior limbic network, followed by the DMN, whereas other neocortical networks were relatively spared. Hypometabolism appeared to be a mixture of both amyloid- and atrophy-related profiles. Similar patterns of modality-dependent network specificity were also observed in the predementia and, for amyloid deposition, in the preclinical stage. These quantitative data confirm a high vulnerability of the DMN for multimodal imaging abnormalities in AD. However, rather than being selective for the DMN, imaging abnormalities more generally affect higher order cognitive networks and, importantly, the vulnerability profiles of these networks markedly differ for distinct aspects of AD pathology.",

    "title": "Astrocytes release HspB1 in response to amyloid-beta exposure in vitro.",
    "abstract": "Although heat shock proteins are thought to function primarily as intracellular chaperones, the release and potential extracellular functions of heat shock proteins have been the focus of an increasing number of studies. Our particular interest is HspB1 (Hsp25/27) and as astrocytes are an in vivo source of HspB1 it is a reasonable possibility they could release HspB1 in response to local stresses. Using primary cultures of rat cortical astrocytes, we investigated the extracellular release of HspB1 with exposure to amyloid-beta (Abeta). In order to assess potential mechanisms of release, we cotreated the cells with compounds that can modulate protein secretion including Brefeldin A, Methyl beta-cyclodextrin, and MAP kinase inhibitors. Exposure to Abeta (0.1, 1.0, 2.0 muM) for 24-48 h resulted in a selective release of HspB1 that was insensitive to BFA treatment; none of the other inhibitors had any detectable influence. Protease protection assays indicated that some of the released HspB1 was associated with a membrane bound fraction, and analysis of exosomal preparations indicated the presence of HspB1 in exosomes. Finally, immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the extracellular HspB1 was able to interact with extracellular Abeta. In summary, Abeta can stimulate release of HspB1 from astrocytes, this release is insensitive to Golgi or lipid raft disruption, and HspB1 can be found either free in the medium or associated with exosomes. This release suggests that there is a potential for extracellular HspB1 to be able to bind and sequester extracellular Abeta.",

    "abstract": "Age is the major risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), and modifying age-related factors may help to delay the onset of the disease. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between age and the metabolic factors related to the risk of developing AD. The concentrations of insulin, amylin, and amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in plasma were measured. We further measured the activity of serum Abeta degradation by using fluorescein- and biotin-labeled Abeta40. Apolipoprotein E4 allele (ApoE4) and cognitive impairment were characterized. Subjects were divided into three age groups: 60-70, 70-80, and >=80 years old. We found that the older the subjects, the lower the concentration of insulin (p = 0.001) and the higher the concentration of Abeta1-40 (p = 0.004) in plasma. However, age was not associated with the concentration of another pancreatic peptide, amylin, and only marginally with Abeta1-42. These relationships remained in the absence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and stroke, and regardless of the presence of ApoE4 and cognitive impairment. Both age and ApoE4 were inversely associated with, while insulin was positively associated with, the activities of Abeta degradation in serum. Our study suggested that low concentration of insulin and high concentration of Abeta40 are aging factors related to the risk of AD.",

    "abstract": "The aged brain may be used as a tool to investigate altered metabolism of amyloid beta protein (Abeta42) that may have implications in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we have observed a striking increase in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) level in the brain cortex of aged rats (22-24 months) along with a mild but statistically significant increase in the level of APP mRNA. Moreover, the activity of beta secretase is elevated (nearly 55%) and that of neprilysin diminished (48%) in brain cortex of aged rats compared to that in young rats (4-6 months). All these changes lead to a markedly increased accumulation of Abeta42 in brain cortical tissue of aged rats. Long-term dietary supplementation of rats with a combination of N-acetylcysteine, alpha-lipoic and alpha-tocopherol from 18 months onwards daily till the sacrifice of the animals by 22-24 months, attenuates the age-related alterations in amyloid beta metabolism. In separate experiments, a significant impairment of spatial learning and memory has been observed in aged rats, and the phenomenon is remarkably prevented by the dietary supplementation of the aged animals by the same combination of N-acetylcysteine, alpha-lipoic acid and alpha-tocopherol. The results call for further explorations of this combination in suitable animal models in ameliorating AD related brain deficits.",

    "abstract": "Retinal Muller glial cells have already been implicated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is characterized by accumulation of toxic amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta); the question we raise is as follows: is P2X7 receptor, known to play an important role in several degenerative diseases, involved in Abeta toxicity on Muller cells? Retinal Muller glial cells were incubated with Abeta for 48 h. Cell viability was assessed using the alamarBlue assay and cytotoxicity using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. P2X7 receptor expression was highlighted by immunolabeling observed on confocal microscopy and its activation was evaluated by YO-PRO-1 assay. Hoechst 33342 was used to evaluate chromatin condensation, and caspases 8 and 3 activation was assessed using AMC assays. Lipid formulation rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) used in Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 was incubated on cells for 15 min prior to Abeta incubation. For the first time, we showed that Abeta induced caspase-independent apoptosis through P2X7 receptor activation on our retinal model. DHA and EPA are polyunsaturated fatty acids recommended in food supplement to prevent AMD. We therefore modulated Abeta cytotoxicity using a lipid formulation rich in DHA and EPA to have a better understanding of the results observed in clinical studies. We showed that fish oil rich in EPA and DHA, in combination with a potent P2X7 receptor antagonist, represents an efficient modulator of Abeta toxicity and that P2X7 could be an interesting therapeutic target to prevent AMD.",

    "abstract": "The altered metabolism of iron impacts the brain function in multiple deleterious ways during normal aging as well as in Alzheimer's disease. We have shown in this study that chelatable iron accumulates in the aged rat brain along with overexpression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and ferritin, accompanied by significant alterations in amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide homeostasis in the aging brain, such as an increased production of the amyloid-beta protein precursor, a decreased level of neprilysin, and increased accumulation of Abeta42. When aged rats are given daily the iron chelator, deferasirox, over a period of more than 4 months starting from the 18th month, the age-related accumulation of iron and overexpression of TfR1 and ferritin in the brain are significantly prevented. More interestingly, the chelator treatment also considerably reverses the altered Abeta peptide metabolism in the aging brain implying a significant role of iron in the latter phenomenon. Further, other results indicate that iron accumulation results in oxidative stress and the activation of NF-kappaB in the aged rat brain, which are also reversed by the deferasirox treatment. The analysis of the results together suggests that iron accumulation and oxidative stress interact at multiple levels that include transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms to bring about changes in the expression levels of TfR1 and ferritin and also alterations in Abeta peptide metabolism in the aging rat brain. The efficacy of deferasirox in preventing age-related changes in iron and Abeta peptide metabolism in the aging brain, as shown here, has obvious therapeutic implications for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Passive immunotherapy targeting amyloid-beta reduces cerebral amyloid angiopathy and improves vascular reactivity.",
    "abstract": "Prominent cerebral amyloid angiopathy is often observed in the brains of elderly individuals and is almost universally found in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is characterized by accumulation of the shorter amyloid-beta isoform(s) (predominantly amyloid-beta40) in the walls of leptomeningeal and cortical arterioles and is likely a contributory factor to vascular dysfunction leading to stroke and dementia in the elderly. We used transgenic mice with prominent cerebral amyloid angiopathy to investigate the ability of ponezumab, an anti-amyloid-beta40 selective antibody, to attenuate amyloid-beta accrual in cerebral vessels and to acutely restore vascular reactivity. Chronic administration of ponezumab to transgenic mice led to a significant reduction in amyloid and amyloid-beta accumulation both in leptomeningeal and brain vessels when measured by intravital multiphoton imaging and immunohistochemistry. By enriching for cerebral vascular elements, we also measured a significant reduction in the levels of soluble amyloid-beta biochemically. We hypothesized that the reduction in vascular amyloid-beta40 after ponezumab administration may reflect the ability of ponezumab to mobilize an interstitial fluid pool of amyloid-beta40 in brain. Acutely, ponezumab triggered a significant and transient increase in interstitial fluid amyloid-beta40 levels in old plaque-bearing transgenic mice but not in young animals. We also measured a beneficial effect on vascular reactivity following acute administration of ponezumab, even in vessels where there was a severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy burden. Taken together, the beneficial effects ponezumab administration has on reducing the rate of cerebral amyloid angiopathy deposition and restoring cerebral vascular health favours a mechanism that involves rapid removal and/or neutralization of amyloid-beta species that may otherwise be detrimental to normal vessel function.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta (Abeta42) peptide is an important biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Variability in measured Abeta42 concentrations at different laboratories may be overcome by standardization and establishing traceability to a reference system. Candidate certified reference materials (CRMs) are validated herein for this purpose. METHODS: Commutability of 16 candidate CRM formats was assessed across five CSF Abeta42 immunoassays and one mass spectrometry (MS) method in a set of 48 individual clinical CSF samples. Promising candidate CRM formats (neat CSF and CSF spiked with Abeta42) were identified and subjected to validation across eight (Elecsys, EUROIMMUN, IBL, INNO-BIA AlzBio3, INNOTEST, MSD, Simoa, and Saladax) immunoassays and the MS method in 32 individual CSF samples. Commutability was evaluated by Passing-Bablok regression and the candidate CRM termed commutable when found within the prediction interval (PI). The relative distance to the regression line was assessed. RESULTS: The neat CSF candidate CRM format was commutable for almost all method comparisons, except for the Simoa/MSD, Simoa/MS and MS/IBL where it was found just outside the 95% PI. However, the neat CSF was found within 5% relative distance to the regression line for MS/IBL, between 5% and 10% for Simoa/MS and between 10% and 15% for Simoa/MSD comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: The neat CSF candidate CRM format was commutable for 33 of 36 method comparisons, only one comparison more than expected given the 95% PI acceptance limit. We conclude that the neat CSF candidate CRM can be used for value assignment of the kit calibrators for the different Abeta42 methods.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder in which amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide accumulates in the brain. The receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) is a cellular binding site for Abeta peptide and mediates amyloid beta-induced perturbations in cerebral vessels, neurons, and microglia in AD. Here, we identified a specific high-affinity RAGE inhibitor (APDTKTQ named RP-1) from a phage display library. RP-1 bound to RAGE and inhibited Abeta peptide-induced cellular stress in human neuroblastoma SH-SYSY cells in vitro. Three amino acids in RP-1 are identical to those in the Abeta peptide. RP-1 shows high homology to the 16-23 (KLVFFAED) regions in Abeta peptide and high-affinity RAGE. Functional analyses indicated that RP-1 significantly reduced the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS products and that it enhanced catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. Furthermore, it inactivated caspase3 and caspase9 and inhibited the upregulation of RAGE, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) protein expression. In addition, RP-1 activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, inhibiting the interaction between Bax and Bcl-2. Our data suggest that RP-1 is a potent RAGE blocker that effectively controls the progression of Abeta peptide-mediated brain disorders and that it may have potential as a disease-modifying agent for AD.",

    "abstract": "The amyloidogenic pathway is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, growing evidence suggests that a linear disease model based on beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) alone is not likely to be realistic, which therefore calls for further investigations on the other actors involved in the play. The pro-oxidant environment induced by Abeta in AD pathology is well established, and a correlation among Abeta, oxidative stress, and conformational changes in p53 has been suggested. In this study, we applied a multifunctional approach to identify allyl thioesters of variously substituted trans-cinnamic acids for which the pharmacological profile was strategically tuned by hydroxy substituents on the aromatic moiety. Indeed, only catechol derivative 3 [(S)-allyl (E)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)prop-2-enethioate] inhibited Abeta fibrilization. Conversely, albeit to different extents, all compounds were able to decrease the formation of reactive oxygen species in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and to prevent alterations in the conformation of p53 and its activity mediated by soluble sub-lethal concentrations of Abeta. This may support an involvement of oxidative stress in Abeta function, with p53 emerging as a potential mediator of their functional interplay.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) are photoreceptors driving circadian photoentrainment, and circadian dysfunction characterizes Alzheimer disease (AD). We investigated mRGCs in AD, hypothesizing that they contribute to circadian dysfunction. METHODS: We assessed retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in 21 mild-moderate AD patients, and in a subgroup of 16 we evaluated rest-activity circadian rhythm by actigraphy. We studied postmortem mRGCs by immunohistochemistry in retinas, and axons in optic nerve cross-sections of 14 neuropathologically confirmed AD patients. We coimmunostained for retinal amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition and melanopsin to locate mRGCs. All AD cohorts were compared with age-matched controls. RESULTS: We demonstrated an age-related optic neuropathy in AD by OCT, with a significant reduction of RNFL thickness (p = 0.038), more evident in the superior quadrant (p = 0.006). Axonal loss was confirmed in postmortem AD optic nerves. Abnormal circadian function characterized only a subgroup of AD patients. Sleep efficiency was significantly reduced in AD patients (p = 0.001). We also found a significant loss of mRGCs in postmortem AD retinal specimens (p = 0.003) across all ages and abnormal mRGC dendritic morphology and size (p = 0.003). In flat-mounted AD retinas, Abeta accumulation was remarkably evident inside and around mRGCs. INTERPRETATION: We show variable degrees of rest-activity circadian dysfunction in AD patients. We also demonstrate age-related loss of optic nerve axons and specifically mRGC loss and pathology in postmortem AD retinal specimens, associated with Abeta deposition. These results all support the concept that mRGC degeneration is a contributor to circadian rhythm dysfunction in AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is emerging evidence suggesting that abnormal transport of amyloid-beta (Abeta) across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is involved in diabetes-associated cognitive decline. We investigated whether PPARgamma agonists restore Abeta transport across the BBB and hippocampal plasticity in db/db mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Efflux and influx of Abeta across the BBB were determined by stereotaxic intra-cerebral or i.a. infusion of [(125) I]-Abeta1-40 respectively. Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), which are involved in Abeta influx and efflux, PPARgamma and NF-kappaB p65 at the BBB, as well as hippocampal Abeta, caspase-3, Bax and Bcl-2 were assayed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. In vivo, hippocampal LTP was recorded, and Morris water maze and Y-maze tasks were performed. KEY RESULTS: Treatment with PPARgamma agonists, rosiglitazone (0.8 mg kg(-1) ) and pioglitazone (9.0 mg kg(-1) ), for 6 weeks significantly increased Abeta efflux and decreased Abeta influx across the BBB in db/db mice. Concomitantly, they decreased hippocampal Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 , suppressed neuronal apoptosis, as indicated by decreased caspase-3 activity and increased ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and increased hippocampal plasticity, characterized by an enhanced in vivo LTP and better performance in behavioural tests. Furthermore, the PPARgamma agonists induced the expression of LRP1 gene by activation of PPARgamma and suppressed RAGE gene expression by inactivation of NF-kappaB signalling at the BBB of db/db mice. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: PPARgamma agonists modify abnormal Abeta transport across the BBB and this is accompanied by amelioration of beta-amyloidosis and an improvement in hippocampal plasticity in diabetic mice.",

    "abstract": "Zinc ions and modified amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) play a critical role in the pathological aggregation of endogenous Abeta in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Zinc-induced Abeta oligomerization is mediated by the metal-binding domain (MBD) which includes N-terminal residues 1-16 (Abeta1-16). Earlier, it has been shown that Abeta1-16 as well as some of its naturally occurring variants undergoes zinc-induced homodimerization via the interface in which zinc ion is coordinated by Glu11 and His14 of the interacting subunits. In this study using surface plasmon resonance technique, we have found that in the presence of zinc ions Abeta1-16 forms heterodimers with MBDs of two Abeta species linked to AD: Abeta containing isoAsp7 (isoAbeta) and Abeta containing phosphorylated Ser8 (pS8-Abeta). The heterodimers appear to possess the same interface as the homodimers. Simulation of 200 ns molecular dynamic trajectories in two constructed models of dimers ([Abeta1-16/Zn/Abeta1-16] and [isoAbeta1-16/Zn/Abeta1-16]), has shown that conformational flexibility of the N-terminal fragments of the dimer subunits is controlled by the structure of corresponding sites 6-8. The data suggest that isoAbeta and pS8-Abeta can be involved in the AD pathogenesis by means of their zinc-dependent interactions with endogenous Abeta resulting in the formation of heterodimeric seeds for amyloid aggregation.",

    "title": "Amyloid-beta suppresses AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling and contributes to alpha-synuclein-induced cytotoxicity.",
    "abstract": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by abnormal accumulation of Lewy bodies, which are intracellular deposits composed primarily of aggregated alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn). Although alphaSyn has been strongly implicated to induce neurotoxicity, overexpression of wild-type alphaSyn is shown to be insufficient to trigger formation of protein aggregates by itself. Therefore, investigating the possible mechanism underlying alphaSyn aggregation is essential to understand the pathogenesis of DLB. Previous studies have demonstrated that amyloid beta (Abeta), the primary cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD), may promote the formation of alphaSyn inclusion bodies. However, it remains unclear how Abeta contributes to the deposition and neurotoxicity of alphaSyn. In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxic effects of Abeta in alphaSyn-overexpressed neuronal cells. Our results showed that Abeta inhibits autophagy and enhances alphaSyn aggregation in alphaSyn-overexpressed cells. Moreover, Abeta also reduced sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and its downstream signaling, resulting in increased intracellular ROS accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our in vitro and in vivo studies support that Abeta-inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling is involved in the neurotoxic effects of alphaSyn. Taken together, our findings suggest that Abeta plays a synergistic role in alphaSyn aggregation and cytotoxicity, which may provide a novel understanding for exploring the underlying molecular mechanism of DLB.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and microglia, the brain's resident phagocyte, are pivotal for the immune response observed in AD. Microglia act as sentinel and protective cells, but may become inappropriately reactive in AD to drive neuropathology. Recent Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified more than 20 gene variants associated with an increased risk of late-onset AD (LOAD), the most prevalent form of AD [1]. The findings strongly implicate genes related to the immune response (CR1, CD33, MS4A, CLU, ABCA7, EPHA1 and HLA-DRB5-HLA-DRB1), endocytosis (BIN1, PICALM, CD2AP, EPHA1 and SORL1) and lipid biology (CLU, ABCA7 and SORL1) [2-8], and many encode proteins which are highly expressed in microglia [1]. Furthermore, recent identification of a low frequency mutation in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 protein (TREM2) confers increased risk of AD in LOAD cohorts with an effect size similar to that for APOE, until recently the only identified genetic risk factor associated with LOAD [9,10(  )] (Figure 1). The present review summarises our current understanding of the probable roles of microglial genes in the regulation of neuroinflammatory processes in AD and their relation to other processes affecting the disease's progression.",

    "abstract": "Current evidence suggests that lipid homeostasis in the hippocampus is affected by different genetic, dietary, and hormonal factors, and that its deregulation may be associated with the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the precise levels of influence of each of these factors and their potential interactions remain largely unknown, particularly during neurodegenerative processes. In the present study, we have performed multifactorial analyses of the combined effects of diets containing different doses of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), estrogen status (ovariectomized animals receiving vehicle or 17beta-estradiol), and genotype (wild-type or transgenic APP/PS1 mice) in hippocampal lipid profiles. We have observed that the three factors affect lipid classes and fatty acid composition to different extents, and that strong interactions between these factors exist. The most aberrant lipid profiles were observed in APP/PS1 animals receiving DHA-poor diets and deprived of estrogens. Conversely, wild-type animals under a high-DHA diet and receiving estradiol exhibited a lipid profile that closely resembled that of the hippocampus of control animals. Interestingly, though the lipid signatures of APP/PS1 hippocampi markedly differed from wild-type, administration of a high-DHA diet in the presence of estrogens gave rise to a lipid profile that approached that of control animals. Paralleling changes in lipid composition, patterns of gene expression of enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis were also altered and affected by combination of experimental factors. Overall, these results indicate that hippocampal lipid homeostasis is strongly affected by hormonal and dietary conditions, and that manipulation of these factors might be incorporated in AD therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) accounts for 1%-2% of all Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects, with large variation in the reported genetic contribution of known dementia genes. In this pilot study, we genetically characterized a German EOAD cohort (23 subjects) by whole-exome sequencing, capturing variants in all recognized AD and frontotemporal dementia genes. After variant filtering, we identified 7 events of altogether 6 different rare variants in 6 subjects, including 4 novel variants. Four of the 6 variants, observed in 5 different index subjects (5/23 = 22%), were considered to be possibly pathogenic. These included 2 presenilin 2 (PSEN2) variants (p.N141I-previously denoted as a Volga German variant, observed in 2 index subjects; and p.L238P), 1 amyloid precursor protein (p.I716M), and 1 presenilin 1 (DeltaE9). Using a control exome data set of 96 ethnically matched neurodegenerative disease controls (Parkinson's disease), we identified only 1 variant (PSEN2 p.T18M) (1%), demonstrating a significantly higher mutational burden in the EOAD group (p > 0.0001). Our findings demonstrate a substantial frequency of variants in dementia genes in EOAD, including several seemingly \"sporadic\" subjects. This indicates that heritability in EOAD might be higher than assumed. The finding of 3 subjects carrying potential pathogenic PSEN2 variants suggests that, in specific populations PSEN2 variants might be as frequent as (or more frequent than) presenilin 1, for example, in German populations which are influenced by Volga German heritage. Variants in AD genes were also associated with rare phenotypes such as frontal AD or primary progressive aphasia, demonstrating the need to screen AD genes in frontotemporal dementia-like phenotypes.",

    "title": "Soluble Abeta oligomers impair hippocampal LTP by disrupting glutamatergic/GABAergic balance.",
    "abstract": "Epileptic activity may be more prevalent in early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) than previously believed. Several studies report spontaneous seizures and interictal discharges in mouse models of AD undergoing age-related Abeta accumulation. The mechanism by which Abeta-induced neuronal excitability can trigger epileptiform activity remains unknown. Here, we systematically examined field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) in stratum radiatum and population spikes (PSs) in the adjacent stratum pyramidale of CA1 in wild-type mouse hippocampal slices. Soluble Abeta oligomers (oAbeta) blocked hippocampal LTP and EPSP-spike (E-S) potentiation, and these effects were occluded by prior treatment with the glutamate uptake inhibitor TBOA. In accord, oAbeta elevated glutamate levels in the hippocampal slice medium. Recording the PS revealed that oAbeta increased PS frequency and reduced LTP, and this LTP deficit was occluded by pretreatment with the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin. Whole-cell recordings showed that oAbeta significantly increased spontaneous EPSC frequency. Decreasing neuronal activity by increasing GABA tone or partially blocking NMDAR activity prevented oAbeta impairment of hippocampal LTP. Finally, treating slices with two antiepileptic drugs rescued the LTP inhibition induced by oAbeta. We conclude that soluble Abeta oligomers at the low nanomolar levels present in AD brain increase neuronal excitability by disrupting glutamatergic/GABAergic balance, thereby impairing synaptic plasticity.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: Our main objective was to determine the neuropathological correlates of dementia in patients with Lewy body disease (LBD). Furthermore, we used data derived from clinical, neuropathological and genetic studies to investigate boundary issues between Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with (PDD) and without (PDND) dementia. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-one cases with a neuropathological diagnosis of LBD and clinical information on dementia status were included in the analysis (55 PDD, 17 DLB and 49 PDND). We carried out topographical and semi-quantitative assessment of Lewy bodies (LB), Abeta plaques and tau-positive neuropil threads (NT). The APOE genotype and MAPT haplotype status were also determined. RESULTS: The cortical LB (CLB) burden was the only independent predictor of dementia (OR: 4.12, P < 0.001). The total cortical Abeta plaque burden was an independent predictor of a shorter latency to dementia from onset of motor signs (P = 0.001). DLB cases had a higher LB burden in the parietal and temporal cortex, compared to PDD. Carrying at least one APOE epsilon4 allele was associated with a higher cortical LB burden (P = 0.02), particularly in the neocortical frontal, parietal and temporal regions. CONCLUSIONS: High CLB burden is a key neuropathological substrate of dementia in LBD. Elevated cortical LB pathology and Abeta plaque deposition are both correlated with a faster progression to dementia. The higher CLB load in the temporal and parietal regions, which seems to be a distinguishing feature of DLB, may account for the shorter latency to dementia and could be mediated by the APOE epsilon4 allele.",

In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effects of these water-soluble FA derivatives on Abeta-induced neurodegeneration both in vitro and in vivo. FA and water-soluble FA derivatives inhibited Abeta aggregation and destabilized pre-aggregated Abeta to a similar extent. Furthermore, water-soluble FA derivatives, as well as FA, inhibited Abeta-induced neuronal cell death in cultured neuronal cells. In in vivo experiments, oral administration of water-soluble FA derivatives to mice improved Abeta-induced dysmnesia assessed by contextual fear conditioning test and protected hippocampal neurons against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity.

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have associated clusterin (CLU) variants with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of CLU on AD pathogenesis is not totally understood. We used cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma CLU levels as endophenotypes for genetic studies to understand the role of CLU in AD. CSF, but not plasma, CLU levels were significantly associated with AD status and CSF tau/amyloid-beta ratio, and highly correlated with CSF apolipoprotein E (APOE) levels. Several loci showed almost genome-wide significant associations including LINC00917 (p = 3.98 x 10(-7)) and interleukin 6 (IL6, p = 9.94 x 10(-6), in the entire data set and in the APOE epsilon4- individuals p = 7.40 x 10(-8)). Gene ontology analyses suggest that CSF CLU levels may be associated with wound healing and immune response which supports previous functional studies that demonstrated an association between CLU and IL6. CLU may play a role in AD by influencing immune system changes that have been observed in AD or by disrupting healing after neurodegeneration.",

RESULTS: R121919 significantly prevented the onset of cognitive impairment in female mice and reduced cellular and synaptic deficits and beta amyloid and C-terminal fragment-beta levels in both genders.

Familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) mutations within PS1 were analyzed in yeast cells artificially expressing membrane-bound substrate, amyloid precursor protein, or Notch fused to Gal4 transcriptional activator. The FAD mutations, L166P and G384A (Leu-166 to Pro and Gly-384 to Ala substitution, respectively), were loss-of-function in yeast. We identified five amino acid substitutions that suppress the FAD mutations. The cleavage of amyloid precursor protein or Notch was recovered by the secondary mutations. We also found that secondary mutations alone activated the gamma-secretase activity. FAD mutants with suppressor mutations, L432M or S438P within TMD9 together with a missense mutation in the second or sixth loops, regained gamma-secretase activity when introduced into presenilin null mouse fibroblasts. Notably, the cells with suppressor mutants produced a decreased amount of Abeta42, which is responsible for Alzheimer disease.

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) monomers represent a base state in the pathways of aggregation that result in the fibrils and oligomers implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The structural properties of these intrinsically disordered peptides remain unclear despite extensive experimental and computational investigations. Further, there are mutations within Abeta that change the way the peptide aggregates and are known to cause familial AD (FAD). Here, we analyze the ensembles of different isoforms (Abeta42 and Abeta40) and mutants (E22Delta, D23N, E22K, E22G, and A2T in Abeta40) of Abeta generated with all-atom replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations on the mus/replica time scale. These were run using three different force field/water model combinations: OPLS-AA/L and TIP3P (\"OPLS\"), AMBER99sb-ILDN and TIP4P-Ew (\"ILDN\"), as well as CHARMM22* and TIP3SP (\"CHARMM\"). Despite fundamental changes in simulation parameters, we find that the resulting ensembles demonstrate a strong convergence in structural properties. In particular, antiparallel contacts between L17-A21 and A30-L34 are prevalent in ensembles of Abeta40, directly forming beta sheets in the OPLS and ILDN combinations. A21-A30 commonly forms an interceding region that rarely interacts with the rest of the peptide. Further, Abeta42 contributes new beta hairpin motifs involving V40-I41 in both OPLS and ILDN. However, the structural flexibility of the central region and the electrostatic interactions that characterize it are notably different between the different conditions. Further, for OPLS, each of the FAD mutations disrupts central bend character and increases the polymorphism of antiparallel contacts across the central region. However, the studied mutations in the ILDN set primarily encourage more global contacts involving the N-terminus and the central region, and promote the formation of new beta topologies that may seed different aggregates involved in disease phenotypes. These differences aside, the large degree of agreement between simulation sets across multiple force fields provides a generalizable characterization of Abeta that is also consistent with experimental data and models.",

    "abstract": "The pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of Abeta peptides in human brains. These Abeta peptides can be degraded by several enzymes such as hACE, hECE, hIDE and cathepsin B. Out of which cathepsin B also belongs to the papain super family and has been found in human brains, it has a role in Abeta peptide degradation through limited proteolysis. The Abeta concentrations are maintained properly by its production and clearance via receptor-mediated cellular uptake and direct enzymatic degradation. However, the reduced production of Abeta degrading enzymes as well as their Abeta degrading activity in human brains initiate the process of accumulation of Abeta peptides. So it becomes essential to investigate the molecular interactions involved in the process of Abeta degradation in detail at the atomic level. Hence, homology modeling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation techniques have been used to explore the possible role of cathepsin B from Hordeum vulgare in the degradation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides. The homology model of cathepsin B from Hordeum vulgare shows good similarity with human cathepsin B. Molecular docking and MD simulation results revealed that the active site residues Cys32, HIS112, HIS113 are involved in the catalytic activity of cathepsin B. The sulfhydryl group of the Cys32 residue of cathepsin B from Hordeum vulgare cleaves the Abeta peptide from the carboxylic end of Glu11. Hence, this structural study might be helpful in designing alternative strategies for the treatment of AD.",

We used a standard linear model and retested the associations with a mixed linear model to correct the residual sample structure.

    "title": "Positron Emission Tomographic Imaging in Stroke: Cross-Sectional and Follow-Up Assessment of Amyloid in Ischemic Stroke.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cardiovascular risk factors significantly increase the risk of developing Alzheimer disease. A possible mechanism may be via ischemic infarction-driving amyloid deposition. We conducted a study to determine the presence of beta-amyloid in infarct, peri-infarct, and hemispheric areas after stroke. We hypothesized that an infarct would trigger beta-amyloid deposition, with deposition over time. METHODS: Patients were recruited within 40 days of acute ischemic stroke and imaged with computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging and Pittsburgh compound B (11C-PiB) positron emission tomographic scans. Follow-up positron emission tomographic scanning was performed in a subgroup <=18 months after the stroke event. Standardized uptake value ratios for regions of interest were analyzed after coregistration. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were imaged with (11)C-PiB positron emission tomography. There was an increase in (11)C-PiB accumulation in the stroke area compared with a reference region in the contralesional hemisphere, which was not statistically significant (median difference in standardized uptake value ratio, 0.07 [95% confidence interval, -0.06 to 0.123]; P=0.452). There was no significant increase in the accumulation of (11)C-PiB in the peri-infarct region or in the ipsilesional hemisphere (median difference in standardized uptake value ratio, 0.04 [95% confidence interval, -0.02 to 0.10]; P=0.095). We repeated (11)C-PiB positron emission tomography in 21 patients and found a significant reduction in accumulation of (11)C-PiB between regions of interest (median difference in standardized uptake value ratio, -0.08 [95% confidence interval, -0.23 to -0.03]; P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant increase in (11)C-PiB accumulation in or around the infarct. There was no increase in ipsilesional hemispheric (11)C-PiB accumulation over time. We found no evidence that infarction leads to sustained or increased beta-amyloid deposition <=18 months after stroke.",

ProSP-C (prosurfactant protein C) BRICHOS binds to stretches of hydrophobic amino acid residues, which are unfolded or in beta-strand conformation, suggesting that it may have broad anti-amyloid activity. We have studied the effect of the proSP-C BRICHOS domain on the designed amyloidogenic beta-sheet proteins beta17 and beta23. beta17 expressed in the secretory pathway of HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells forms intracellular inclusions, whereas beta23 is rapidly degraded. Co-expression of BRICHOS leads to a reduction in beta17 inclusion size and increased levels of soluble beta17 and beta23. Furthermore, BRICHOS interacts with the beta-proteins intracellularly, reduces their ubiquitination and decreases aggresome formation and proteasomal inhibition. Collectively, these data suggest that BRICHOS is capable of delaying the aggregation process and toxicity of amyloidogenic proteins in a generic manner.",

    "title": "The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor methazolamide prevents amyloid beta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase activation protecting neuronal and glial cells in vitro and in the mouse brain.",
    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction has been recognized as an early event in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, preceding and inducing neurodegeneration and memory loss. The presence of cytochrome c (CytC) released from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm is often detected after acute or chronic neurodegenerative insults, including AD. The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (CAI) methazolamide (MTZ) was identified among a library of drugs as an inhibitor of CytC release and proved to be neuroprotective in Huntington's disease and stroke models. Here, using neuronal and glial cell cultures, in addition to an acute model of amyloid beta (Abeta) toxicity, which replicates by intra-hippocampal injection the consequences of interstitial and cellular accumulation of Abeta, we analyzed the effects of MTZ on neuronal and glial degeneration induced by the Alzheimer's amyloid. MTZ prevented DNA fragmentation, CytC release and activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3 induced by Abeta in neuronal and glial cells in culture through the inhibition of mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production. Moreover, intraperitoneal administration of MTZ prevented neurodegeneration induced by intra-hippocampal Abeta injection in the mouse brain and was effective at reducing caspase 3 activation in neurons and microglia in the area surrounding the injection site. Our results, delineating the molecular mechanism of action of MTZ against Abeta-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase activation, and demonstrating its efficiency in a model of acute amyloid-mediated toxicity, provide the first combined in vitro and in vivo evidence supporting the potential of a new therapy employing FDA-approved CAIs in AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is caused by amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaOs). AbetaOs induce cell death by triggering oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. A recent study showed that AbetaO-induced oxidative stress is associated with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fission. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are regulated by antioxidant enzymes, especially peroxiredoxins (Prxs) that scavenge H2O2. These enzymes inhibit neuronal cell death induced by various neurotoxic reagents. However, it is unclear whether Prx5, which is specifically expressed in neuronal cells, protects these cells from AbetaO-induced damage. In this study, we found that Prx5 expression was upregulated by AbetaO-induced oxidative stress and that Prx5 decreased ERK-Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis of HT-22 neuronal cells. Prx5 expression was affected by AbetaO, and amelioration of oxidative stress by N-acetyl-L-cysteine decreased AbetaO-induced Prx5 expression. Prx5 overexpression reduced ROS as well as RNS and apoptotic cell death but Prx5 knockdown did not. In addition, Prx5 overexpression ameliorated ERK-Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation but Prx5 knockdown did not. These results indicated that inducible Prx5 expression by AbetaO plays a key role in inhibiting both ERK-Drp1-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and neuronal cell death by regulating oxidative stress. Thus, Prx5 may be a new therapeutic agent for treating AD.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Cyclooxygenase (COX), a prostanoid-synthesizing enzyme, is considered to be involved in the neuroinflammatory process of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the role of COX in the progression of neurodegeneration is not well understood. We hypothesized that in vivo imaging of COX by PET will contribute to elucidation of the function of COX during the neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer's disease (AD). (11)C-labeled ketoprofen methyl ester (racemic (RS)-(11)C-KTP-Me) developed recently by our group is a useful PET probe for in vivo imaging of COX-1 during neuroinflammation. The (S)-enantiomer of ketoprofen is known to be pharmacologically more active than the (R)-enantiomer. We thus synthesized (11)C-labeled (S)-ketoprofen methyl ester ((S)-(11)C-KTP-Me) as an improved PET probe specific for COX-1 and applied it for investigation of the changes in COX-1 during the progression of AD in a mouse model. METHODS: The specificity of (S)-(11)C-KTP-Me for COXs was examined in PET studies with rats that had intrastriatal injection of lipopolysaccharide. To determine the details of changes in COX-1 during progression of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque formation in amyloid precursor protein transgenic (APP-Tg) mice, we performed immunohistochemical studies and ex vivo autoradiography with (S)-(11)C-KTP-Me. RESULTS: PET studies using hemispheric lipopolysaccharide injection into rats revealed that the sensitivity of (S)-(11)C-KTP-Me in neuroinflammation was much higher than that of (RS)-(11)C-KTP-Me and (R)-(11)C-KTP-Me; these results closely corresponded to the inhibitory activities of each enantiomer against COX-1 estimated by an in vitro assay. In APP-Tg mice, (S)-(11)C-KTP-Me administration resulted in progressive and significant increases in accumulation of radioactivity in the brain from 16 to 24 mo old in accordance with the histopathologic appearance of abundant Abeta plaques and activated microglia, whereas few changes in radioactivity accumulation and few Abeta plaques were seen in age-matched wild-type control mice. High-radioactivity accumulation by (S)-(11)C-KTP-Me was markedly observed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus in which COX-1-expressing activated microglia tightly surrounded and enclosed large and more intensely stained Abeta plaques, indicating neuroinflammation that originated with Abeta. CONCLUSION: (S)-(11)C-KTP-Me is a potent PET probe that is highly selective for COX-1. Studies using APP-Tg mice demonstrated that (S)-(11)C-KTP-Me could detect activated microglia that are associated with amyloid plaque progression, suggesting the involvement of COX-1 in the neuroinflammatory process in AD.",

Here, obestatin effects were investigated on proliferation and survival of adult rat hippocampal progenitor cells (AHPs). Obestatin immunoreactivity was found in AHPs; moreover, obestatin binding to AHPs was displaced by the GLP-1R agonist Ex-4 and antagonist Ex-9. Furthermore, obestatin increased cell proliferation and survival in growth factor deprived medium and inhibited apoptosis; these effects were blocked by Ex-9. The underlying mechanisms involved Galphas/cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt, and the PI3K targets GSK-3beta/beta-catenin and mTOR. Obestatin also counteracted Abeta1-42-induced detrimental effects through inhibition of GSK-3beta activity and Tau hyperphosphorylation, main hallmarks of neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease. These findings indicate a novel protective role for obestatin in AHPs and candidate this peptide as potential therapeutic target for increasing neurogenesis and for approaching neurodegenerative disorders.",

METHODS: Using longitudinal Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography data from Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, we estimated the age at which each PiB+ individual began accumulating Abeta. We used survival analysis methods to quantify risk of accumulating Abeta and differences in onset age of Abeta accumulation in relation to APOE epsilon4 status and sex among 36 APOE epsilon4 carriers and 83 noncarriers. RESULTS: Age at onset of Abeta accumulation for the APOE epsilon4- and epsilon4+ groups was 73.1 and 60.7, respectively. APOE epsilon4 positivity conferred a threefold risk of accumulating Abeta after adjusting for sex and education. DISCUSSION: Estimation of onset age of amyloid accumulation may help gauge treatment efficacy in interventions to delay symptom onset in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Acceleration of amyloidogenesis and memory impairment by estrogen deficiency through NF-kappaB dependent beta-secretase activation in presenilin 2 mutant mice.",
    "abstract": "Nearly 7-10 million people are living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) worldwide. Senile plaques composed of beta-amyloid (Abeta) are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Presenilin 2 (PS2) mutations increase Abeta generation in the brains of AD patients. The Abeta is generated through the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by beta- and gamma-secretases. Additionally, increasing evidences suggest that estrogen can reduce the development of AD via regulation of beta-secretases activity and beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) expression. But the underlying correlation mechanism of Abeta generation by PS2 mutations and estrogen remains to be clarified. To investigate the anti-amyloidogenesis effect of estrogen in a PS2 mutative condition, we examined memory impairment in ovariectomized PS2 mutation (N141I) mice in which cognitive function was assessed by the Morris water maze test and passive avoidance test. In addition, Western blot analysis, immunostaining, immunofluorescence staining, ELISA and enzyme activity assays were used to examine the degree of Abeta deposition in the brains. In the present study, Abeta accumulated more in the ovariectomized PS2 mutant mice brain, and greatly worsened memory impairment and glial activation as well as neurogenic inflammation. In parallel with increased memory impairment, activity of beta-secretase and expression of the BACE1 increased inovariectomized PS2 mutant mice. Much higher activity of NF-kappaB was observed by EMSA in ovariectomized PS2 mutant mice. In addition, the Abeta level was decreased by treatment of beta-estradiol through inhibiting BACE1 expression in PS2 transfacted PC12 cells. These results suggest that mutation of PS2 can lead to NF-kappaB mediate amyloidogensis, and this effect can be amplified by the absence of estrogen.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In a 2014 cross-sectional analysis, we showed that amyloid and neurodegeneration biomarker states in participants with no clinical impairment varied greatly with age, suggesting dynamic within-person processes. In this longitudinal study, we aimed to estimate rates of transition from a less to a more abnormal biomarker state by age in individuals without dementia, as well as to assess rates of transition to dementia from an abnormal state. METHODS: Participants from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (Olmsted County, MN, USA) without dementia at baseline were included in this study, a subset of whom agreed to multimodality imaging. Amyloid PET (with (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B) was used to classify individuals as amyloid positive (A(+)) or negative (A(-)). (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG)-PET and MRI were used to classify individuals as neurodegeneration positive (N(+)) or negative (N(-)). We used all observations, including those from participants who did not have imaging results, to construct a multistate Markov model to estimate four different age-specific biomarker state transition rates: A(-)N(-) to A(+)N(-); A(-)N(-) to A(-)N(+) (suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology); A(+)N(-) to A(+)N(+); and A(-)N(+) to A(+)N(+). We also estimated two age-specific rates to dementia: A(+)N(+) to dementia and A(-)N(+) to dementia. Using these state-to-state transition rates, we estimated biomarker state frequencies by age. FINDINGS: At baseline (between Nov 29, 2004, to March 7, 2015), 4049 participants did not have dementia (3512 [87%] were clinically normal and 537 [13%] had mild cognitive impairment). 1541 individuals underwent imaging between March 28, 2006, to April 30, 2015. Transition rates were low at age 50 years and, with one exception, exponentially increased with age. At age 85 years compared with age 65 years, the rate was nearly 11-times higher (17.2 vs 1.6 per 100 person-years) for the transition from A(-)N(-) to A(-)N(+), three-times higher (20.8 vs 6.1) for A(+)N(-) to A(+)N(+), and five-times higher (13.2 vs 2.6) for A(-)N(+) to A(+)N(+). The rate of transition was also increased at age 85 years compared with age 65 years for A(+)N(+) to dementia (7.0 vs 0.8) and for A(-)N(+) to dementia (1.7 vs 0.6). The one exception to an exponential increase with age was the transition rate from A(-)N(-) to A(+)N(-), which increased from 4.0 transitions per 100 person-years at age 65 years to 6.9 transitions per 100 person-years at age 75 and then plateaued beyond that age. Estimated biomarker frequencies by age from the multistate model were similar to cross-sectional biomarker frequencies. INTERPRETATION: Our transition rates suggest that brain ageing is a nearly inevitable acceleration toward worse biomarker and clinical states. The one exception is the transition to amyloidosis without neurodegeneration, which is most dynamic from age 60 years to 70 years and then plateaus beyond that age. We found that simple transition rates can explain complex, highly interdependent biomarker state frequencies in our population.

    "title": "Median and ulnar nerve anastomoses in the upper limb: A meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The most frequently described anomalous neural connections between the median and ulnar nerves in the upper limb are: Martin-Gruber anastomosis (MGA), Marinacci anastomosis (MA), Riche-Cannieu anastomosis (RCA), and Berrettini anastomosis (BA). The reported prevalence rates and characteristics of these anastomoses vary significantly between studies. METHODS: A search of electronic databases was performed to identify all eligible articles. Anatomical data regarding the anastomoses were pooled into a meta-analysis using MetaXL 2.0. RESULTS: A total of 58 (n = 10,562 upper limbs) articles were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalences were: MGA, 19.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.2%-23.1%); MA, 0.7% (95% CI, 0.1%-1.7%); RCA, 55.5% (95% CI, 30.6%-79.1%); and BA, 60.9% (95% CI, 36.9%-82.6%). The results also showed that MGA was more commonly found unilaterally (66.8%), on the right side (15.7%), following an oblique course (84.8%), and originating from the anterior interosseous nerve with a prevalence of 57.6%. CONCLUSIONS: As anastomoses between the median and ulnar nerves occur commonly, detailed anatomical knowledge is essential for accurate interpretation of electrophysiological findings and reducing the risk of iatrogenic injuries during surgical procedures.

    "abstract": "We aimed to determine whether (18) F-florbetapir amyloid positron emission tomography imaging shows a clinically concordant, left-hemisphere-dominant pattern of deposition in primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Elevated cortical amyloid (Abeta(+) ) was found in 19 of 32 PPA patients. Hemispheric laterality of amyloid burden was compared between Abeta(+) PPA and an Abeta(+) amnestic dementia groups (n = 22). The parietal region showed significantly greater left lateralized amyloid uptake in the PPA group than the amnestic group (p < 0.007), consistent with the left lateralized pattern of neurodegeneration in PPA. These results suggest that the cortical distribution of amyloid may have a greater clinical concordance than previously reported.",

    "title": "Nicotine-induced plasticity in the retinocollicular pathway: Evidence for involvement of amyloid precursor protein.",
    "abstract": "During early postnatal development retinocollicular projections undergo activity-dependent synaptic refinement that results in the formation of precise topographical maps in the visual layers of the superior colliculus (SC). Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is a widely expressed transmembrane glycoprotein involved in the regulation of several aspects of neural development, such as neurite outgrowth, synapse formation and plasticity. Stimulation of cholinergic system has been found to alter the expression and processing of APP in different cell lines. Herein, we investigated the effect of nicotine on the development of retinocollicular pathway and on APP metabolism in the SC of pigmented rats. Animals were submitted to intracranial Elvax implants loaded with nicotine or phosphate-buffered saline (vehicle) at postnatal day (PND) 7. The ipsilateral retinocollicular pathway of control and experimental groups was anterogradely labeled either 1 or 3 weeks after surgery (PND 14 or PND 28). Local nicotine exposure produces a transitory sprouting of uncrossed retinal axons outside their main terminal zones. Nicotine also increases APP content and its soluble neurotrophic fragment sAPPalpha. Furthermore, nicotine treatment upregulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 and beta2 subunits. Taken together, these data indicate that nicotine disrupts the ordering and topographic mapping of axons in the retinocollicular pathway and facilitates APP processing through the nonamyloidogenic pathway, suggesting that sAPPalpha may act as a trophic agent that mediates nicotine-induced morphological plasticity.",

    "title": "Design and Optimization of Anti-amyloid Domain Antibodies Specific for beta-Amyloid and Islet Amyloid Polypeptide.",
    "abstract": "Antibodies with conformational specificity are important for detecting and interfering with polypeptide aggregation linked to several human disorders. We are developing a motif-grafting approach for designing lead antibody candidates specific for amyloid-forming polypeptides such as the Alzheimer peptide (Abeta). This approach involves grafting amyloidogenic peptide segments into the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of single-domain (VH) antibodies. Here we have investigated the impact of polar mutations inserted at the edges of a large hydrophobic Abeta42 peptide segment (Abeta residues 17-42) in CDR3 on the solubility and conformational specificity of the corresponding VH domains. We find that VH expression and solubility are strongly enhanced by introducing multiple negatively charged or asparagine residues at the edges of CDR3, whereas other polar mutations are less effective (glutamine and serine) or ineffective (threonine, lysine, and arginine). Moreover, Abeta VH domains with negatively charged CDR3 mutations show significant preference for recognizing Abeta fibrils relative to Abeta monomers, whereas the same VH domains with other polar CDR3 mutations recognize both Abeta conformers. We observe similar behavior for a VH domain grafted with a large hydrophobic peptide from islet amyloid polypeptide (residues 8-37) that contains negatively charged mutations at the edges of CDR3. These findings highlight the sensitivity of antibody binding and solubility to residues at the edges of CDRs, and provide guidelines for designing other grafted antibody fragments with hydrophobic binding loops.",

    "abstract": "Identification of the chemical and biological properties of amyloid fibrils is important for understanding their roles in human diseases and to clarify the mechanisms that govern their formation. In pursuit of these goals, small molecule fluorescent dyes have received increasing attention as probes of amyloid conformations. In this study, we report on the ability of YOYO-1, a homodimeric derivative of oxazole yellow, to detect fibrils formed by the Alzheimer's disease related Abeta(1-42) peptide. We find that YOYO-1 binds to Abeta(1-42) fibrils with the long axes of its oxazole yellow moieties parallel to the fibril axis, resulting in a 200x emission enhancement; a result that shows that YOYO-1 is a sensitive amyloid probe. Further, YOYO-1 exhibits characteristic absorption shifts upon binding to the Abeta(1-42) fibrils that we attribute to a self-stacking to non-stacking transition in its homodimer configuration; herein we show how this phenomenon can be exploited to estimate the degree of dye binding. Furthermore, we show that YOYO-1 can be used to monitor the kinetics of amyloid formation reactions. Taken together, our results show that YOYO-1 is a sensitive amyloid probe that can operate with both absorption and fluorescence read-outs, and this suggests that this commercially available dye could become a useful complement to thioflavin-T for in vitro amyloid-sensing applications.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. With respect to amyloid deposition, there are no published serial data regarding the deposition rate of amyloid throughout the brain after TBI. The authors conducted serial (18)F-AV-45 (florbetapir F18) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in 2 patients with severe TBI at 1, 12, and 24 months after injury. A total of 12 brain regions were surveyed for changes in amyloid levels. Case 1 involved a 50-year-old man who experienced a severe TBI. Compared with the 1-month time point, of the 12 brain regions that were surveyed, a decrease in amyloid (as indicated by standard uptake value ratios) was only observed in the hippocampus (-16%, left; -12%, right) and caudate nucleus (-18%, left; -18%, right), suggesting that initial amyloid accumulation in the brain was cleared between time points 1 and 12 months after injury. Compared to the scan at 1 year, a greater increase in amyloid (+15%) was observed in the right hippocampus at the 24-month time point. The patient in Case 2 was a 37-year-old man who suffered severe trauma to the head and a subsequent stroke; he had poor cognitive/functional outcomes and underwent 1.5 years of rehabilitation. Due to a large infarct area on the injured side of the brain (right side), the authors focused primarily on brain regions affected within the left hemisphere. Compared with the 1-month scan, they only found an increase in brain amyloid within the left anterior putamen (+11%) at 12 months after injury. In contrast, decreased amyloid burden was detected in the left caudate nucleus (-48%), occipital cortex (-21%), and precuneus (-19%) brain regions at the 12-month time point, which is indicative of early accumulation and subsequent clearance. In comparison with 12-month values, more clearance was observed, since a reduction in amyloid was found at 24 months after trauma within the left anterior putamen (-12%) and occipital cortex (-15%). Also, by 24 months, most of the amyloid had been cleared and the patient demonstrated improved results on the Rivermead symptom questionnaire, Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended, and Disability Rating Scale. With respect to APOE status, the patient in Case 1 had two epsilon3 alleles and the patient in Case 2 had one epsilon2 and one epsilon3 allele. In comparison to the findings of the initial scan at 1 month after TBI, by 12 and 24 months after injury amyloid was cleared in some brain regions and increased in others. Serial imaging conducted here suggests that florbetapir F18 PET imaging may be useful in monitoring amyloid dynamics within specific brain regions following severe TBI and may be predictive of cognitive deficits.",

By immobilizing the capture antibodies of A11 and OC that are specific to the oligomers and fibrils, respectively, in separate fluidic channels, a novel surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor was designed for monitoring the oligomeric and fibrillar species of Abeta(1-42) simultaneously. The influence of curcumin, Cu(2+) and methylene blue on the amount of toxic oligomers and fibrils was evaluated. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of curcumin and methylene blue was determined. The formation of Abeta fibrils was also validated by the thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay.

    "title": "The Alzheimer's disease peptide beta-amyloid promotes thrombin generation through activation of coagulation factor XII.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Essentials How the Alzheimer's disease (AD) peptide beta-amyloid (Abeta) disrupts neuronal function in the disease is unclear. Factor (F) XII initiates blood clotting via FXI, and thrombosis has been implicated in AD. Abeta triggers FXII-dependent FXI and thrombin activation, evidence of which is seen in AD plasma. Abeta-triggered clotting could contribute to neuronal dysfunction in AD and be a novel therapeutic target. SUMMARY: Background beta-Amyloid (Abeta) is a key pathologic element in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanisms by which it disrupts neuronal function in vivo are not completely understood. AD is characterized by a prothrombotic state, which could contribute to neuronal dysfunction by affecting cerebral blood flow and inducing inflammation. The plasma protein factor XII triggers clot formation via the intrinsic coagulation cascade, and has been implicated in thrombosis. Objectives To investigate the potential for Abeta to contribute to a prothrombotic state. Methods and results We show that Abeta activates FXII, resulting in FXI activation and thrombin generation in human plasma, thereby establishing Abeta as a possible driver of prothrombotic states. We provide evidence for this process in AD by demonstrating decreased levels of FXI and its inhibitor C1 esterase inhibitor in AD patient plasma, suggesting chronic activation, inhibition and clearance of FXI in AD. Activation of the intrinsic coagulation pathway in AD is further supported by elevated fibrin levels in AD patient plasma. Conclusions The ability of Abeta to promote coagulation via the FXII-driven contact system identifies new mechanisms by which it could contribute to neuronal dysfunction and suggests potential new therapeutic targets in AD.",

    "abstract": "Excessive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) caused by cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is thought to be the primary cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Two key enzymes ADAM10 and BACE1 are involved in the initial cleavage of APP, resulting in the onset of two pathways, the amyloidogenic pathway and the non-amyloidogenic pathway, respectively. Altering APP metabolism towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway is thought to reduce Abeta production. It has been reported that, in vivo, exogenous neurotrophic factors make APP apt to entering the non-amyloidogenic pathway. Since astrocytes secrete a battery of neurotrophic factors, we investigated the role of astrocyte-derived factors in the dynamics of Abeta generation in neural cells. Results show that C6 glioma cell-conditioned medium (GCM), obtained from cultured astrocyte-derived C6 glioma cells, inhibit Abeta1-42 production and shift APP processing towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway in APPswe-HEK293 cells. Such effect is attributed to two key APP cleavage enzymes, ADAM10 and BACE1. Two neurotrophic factors in the GCM, nerve growth factor and fibroblast growth factor 2, are responsible for the up-regulation of ADAM10 and down-regulation of BACE1, respectively. Our findings enhance our understanding of the relationship between astrocytes and Abeta generation, indicating that stimulation of astrocytic neurotrophic factors could slow AD progression.",

    "abstract": "According to the neurovascular hypothesis, impairment of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) in brain capillaries of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) contributes to neurotoxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) brain accumulation and drives Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, due to conflicting reports on the involvement of LRP1 in Abeta transport and the expression of LRP1 in brain endothelium, the role of LRP1 at the BBB is uncertain. As global Lrp1 deletion in mice is lethal, appropriate models to study the function of LRP1 are lacking. Moreover, the relevance of systemic Abeta clearance to AD pathology remains unclear, as no BBB-specific knockout models have been available. Here, we developed transgenic mouse strains that allow for tamoxifen-inducible deletion of Lrp1 specifically within brain endothelial cells (Slco1c1-CreER(T2) Lrp1(fl/fl) mice) and used these mice to accurately evaluate LRP1-mediated Abeta BBB clearance in vivo. Selective deletion of Lrp1 in the brain endothelium of C57BL/6 mice strongly reduced brain efflux of injected [125I] Abeta(1-42). Additionally, in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, brain endothelial-specific Lrp1 deletion reduced plasma Abeta levels and elevated soluble brain Abeta, leading to aggravated spatial learning and memory deficits, thus emphasizing the importance of systemic Abeta elimination via the BBB. Together, our results suggest that receptor-mediated Abeta BBB clearance may be a potential target for treatment and prevention of Abeta brain accumulation in AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) age of onset (ADAOO) varies greatly between individuals, with unique causal mutations suggesting the role of modifying genetic and environmental interactions. We analyzed ~50 000 common and rare functional genomic variants from 71 individuals of the 'Paisa' pedigree, the world's largest pedigree segregating a severe form of early-onset AD, who were affected carriers of the fully penetrant E280A mutation in the presenilin-1 (PSEN1) gene. Affected carriers with ages at the extremes of the ADAOO distribution (30s-70s age range), and linear mixed-effects models were used to build single-locus regression models outlining the ADAOO. We identified the rs7412 (APOE*E2 allele) as a whole exome-wide ADAOO modifier that delays ADAOO by ~12 years (beta=11.74, 95% confidence interval (CI): 8.07-15.41, P=6.31 x 10(-8), PFDR=2.48 x 10(-3)). Subsequently, to evaluate comprehensively the APOE (apolipoprotein E) haplotype variants (E1/E2/E3/E4), the markers rs7412 and rs429358 were genotyped in 93 AD affected carriers of the E280A mutation. We found that the APOE*E2 allele, and not APOE*E4, modifies ADAOO in carriers of the E280A mutation (beta=8.24, 95% CI: 4.45-12.01, P=3.84 x 10(-5)). Exploratory linear mixed-effects multilocus analysis suggested that other functional variants harbored in genes involved in cell proliferation, protein degradation, apoptotic and immune dysregulation processes (i.e., GPR20, TRIM22, FCRL5, AOAH, PINLYP, IFI16, RC3H1 and DFNA5) might interact with the APOE*E2 allele. Interestingly, suggestive evidence as an ADAOO modifier was found for one of these variants (GPR20) in a set of patients with sporadic AD from the Paisa genetic isolate. This is the first study demonstrating that the APOE*E2 allele modifies the natural history of AD typified by the age of onset in E280A mutation carriers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest analyzed sample of patients with a unique mutation sharing uniform environment. Formal replication of our results in other populations and in other forms of AD will be crucial for prediction, follow-up and presumably developing new therapeutic strategies for patients either at risk or affected by AD.",

    "abstract": "It is well known the role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and of other neurodegenerative pathologies. We have previously documented that Amyloid beta peptide (1-42) (Abeta) dependent-oxidative modifications affect red blood cell (RBC) morphology and function. Experimental studies show that caffeine (CF) consumption is inversely correlated with AD. In this study, we investigated the role played by RBC in the protective mechanism elicited by CF against Abeta mediated toxicity. PS exposure levels by FACS analysis, as well as protein band 3 functionality analysis, indicated that CF at 100 muM protected against Abeta-mediated membrane alterations, which are known to occur in AD. Moreover, CF counteracts inhibition of ATP release from RBC by Abeta, restoring its ability to modulate vasodilation. Concurrently, analysis of protein kinase C (PKC) and caspase 3 activities, responsible for cytoskeleton alterations, revealed that unlike to caspase 3, PKCalpha activation induced by Abeta was fully abolished by CF through a mechanism involving Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), located on external face of RBC plasma membrane. These results provide support for the hypothesis concerning the protective role of CF in AD patients could include also a peripheral mechanism involving RBC.",

    "abstract": "Tg2576 mice are widely used to study amyloid-dependent synaptic dysfunction related to Alzheimer's disease. However, conflicting data have been reported for these mice with regard to basal transmission as well as the in vitro correlate of memory, long-term potentiation (LTP). Some studies show clear impairments, whereas others report no deficiency. The present study uses hippocampal slices from 3-, 10-, and 15-month-old wild-type (WT) and Tg2576 mice to evaluate synaptic function in each group, including experiments to investigate basal synaptic transmission, short- and long-term plasticity by inducing paired-pulse facilitation, and both early and late LTP. We show that synaptic function remains intact in hippocampal slices from Tg2576 mice at 3 months of age. However, both early and late LTP decline progressively during aging in these mice. This deterioration of synaptic plasticity starts affecting early LTP, ultimately leading to the abolishment of both forms of LTP in 15-month-old animals. In comparison, WT littermates display normal synaptic parameters during aging. Additional pharmacological investigation into the involvement of NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels in LTP suggests a distinct mechanism of induction among age groups, demonstrating that both early and late LTP are differentially affected by these channels in Tg2576 mice during aging.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The literature on the prevalence of Alzheimer disease-associated cerebral microbleeds assessed with MR imaging shows considerable heterogeneity in terms of imaging techniques and parameters. Our aim was to perform a meta-analysis of the role of imaging techniques, including image acquisition, field strength and scanner type, and clinical and demographic factors on the reported prevalence of microbleeds in Alzheimer disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The prevalence of microbleeds was examined with respect to a priori-selected moderating variables via meta-analytic tools of literature reports. RESULTS: Fourteen unique studies providing 15 microbleed prevalence rates met the selection criteria for inclusion. The aggregate prevalence of microbleeds was 24% (95% CI, 19%-28%). Scan (SWI = 40%, gradient echo = 18%, EPI = 19%) and field strength (slope = 0.39; standard error = 15, P < .01) influenced the prevalence of microbleeds. The associations between microbleeds and age, sex, and global cognitive status were not significant. After updating the literature, the aggregate prevalence remained in the 95% CI range. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging technique and field strength are strongly associated with the prevalence of microbleeds over the global aggregate. Standardized imaging protocols for identification of microbleeds are recommended to minimize confounds.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular deposition of Beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is the main finding in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which damages cholinergic neurons through oxidative stress and reduces the cholinergic neurotransmission. Satureja bachtiarica is a medicinal plant from the Lamiaceae family which was widely used in Iranian traditional medicine. The aim of the present study was to investigate possible protective effects of S. bachtiarica methanolic extract on Abeta induced spatial memory impairment in Morris Water Maze (MWM), oxidative stress and cholinergic neuron degeneration. Pre- aggregated Abeta was injected into the hippocampus of each rat bilaterally (10 mug/rat) and MWM task was performed 14 days later to evaluate learning and memory function. Methanolic extract of S.bachtiarica (10, 50 and 100 mg/Kg) was injected intraperitoneally for 19 consecutive days, after Abeta injection. After the probe test the brain tissue were collected and lipid peroxidation, Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and Cholin Acetyl Transferees (ChAT) immunorectivity were measured in the hippocampus. Intrahipocampal injection of Abeta impaired learning and memory in MWM in training days and probe trail. Methanolic extract of S. bachtiarica (50 and 100 mg/Kg) could attenuate Abeta-induced memory deficit. ChAT immunostaining revealed that cholinergic neurons were loss in Abeta- injected group and S. bachtiarica (100 mg/Kg) could ameliorate Abeta- induced ChAT reduction in the hippocampus. Also S. bachtiarica could ameliorate Abeta-induced lipid peroxidation and AChE activity increase in the hippocampus. In conclusion our study represent that S.bachtiarica methanolic extract can improve Abeta-induced memory impairment and cholinergic loss then we recommended this extract as a candidate for further investigation in treatment of AD.",

The results show a small-to-moderate relationship between increasing cardiac workload (at rest) and neocortical amyloidosis in individuals at the preclinical stage of AD. Moreover, increasing RPP was linearly related to increasing relative impairments on a spatial working memory task (R2 = 0.30), but only for those individuals with neuroimaging evidence suggestive of preclinical AD.

Patients presented with focal symptomatology and cognitive impairment. MRI revealed cortical microbleeds and asymmetrical hyperintense white matter lesions (WML). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker analyses showed increased anti-Abeta autoantibodies, t-Tau, and p-Tau and decreased Abeta40 and Abeta42. After treatment, focal symptomatology disappeared, and WML and anti-Abeta autoantibodies decreased. The APOEe4 allele was overrepresented.

Despite much research, neuronal locales of APP and BACE-1 convergence and APP cleavage remain unclear. Here we report an optical assay, based on fluorescence complementation, for visualizing in cellulo APP-BACE-1 interactions as a simple on/off signal. Combining this with other assays tracking the fate of internalized APP in hippocampal neurons, we found that APP and BACE-1 interacted in both biosynthetic and endocytic compartments, particularly along recycling microdomains such as dendritic spines and presynaptic boutons. In axons, APP and BACE-1 were cotransported, and they also interacted during transit. Finally, our assay revealed that the Alzheimer's disease-protective 'Icelandic' mutation greatly attenuates APP-BACE-1 interactions, suggesting a mechanistic basis for protection. Collectively, the data challenge canonical models and provide concrete insights into long-standing controversies in the field.",

    "title": "Relationship of regional brain beta-amyloid to gait speed.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate in vivo the relationship of regional brain beta-amyloid (Abeta) to gait speed in a group of elderly individuals at high risk for dementia. METHODS: Cross-sectional associations between brain Abeta as measured with [18F]florbetapir PET and gait speed were examined in 128 elderly participants. Subjects ranged from healthy to mildly cognitively impaired enrolled in the control arm of the multidomain intervention in the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT). Nearly all participants presented spontaneous memory complaints. Regional [18F]florbetapir (AV45) standardized uptake volume ratios were obtained via semiautomated quantitative analysis using the cerebellum as reference region. Gait speed was measured by timing participants while they walked 4 meters. Associations were explored with linear regression, correcting for age, sex, education, body mass index (BMI), and APOE genotype. RESULTS: We found a significant association between Abeta in the posterior and anterior putamen, occipital cortex, precuneus, and anterior cingulate and slow gait speed (all corrected p < 0.05). A multivariate model emphasized the locations of the posterior putamen and the precuneus. Abeta burden explained up to 9% of the variance in gait speed, and significantly improved regression models already containing demographic variables, BMI, and APOE status. CONCLUSIONS: The present PET study confirms, in vivo, previous postmortem evidence showing an association between Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology and gait speed, and provides additional evidence on potential regional effects of brain Abeta on motor function. More research is needed to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying these regional associations, which may involve motor and sensorimotor circuits hitherto largely neglected in the pathophysiology of AD.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular alpha-synuclein has been proposed as a crucial mechanism for induction of pathological aggregate formation in previously healthy cells. In vitro, extracellular alpha-synuclein is partially associated with exosomal vesicles. Recently, we have provided evidence that exosomal alpha-synuclein is present in the central nervous system in vivo. We hypothesized that exosomal alpha-synuclein species from patients with alpha-synuclein related neurodegeneration serve as carriers for interneuronal disease transmission. We isolated exosomes from cerebrospinal fluid from patients with Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, progressive supranuclear palsy as a non-alpha-synuclein related disorder that clinically overlaps with Parkinson's disease, and neurological controls. Cerebrospinal fluid exosome numbers, alpha-synuclein protein content of cerebrospinal fluid exosomes and their potential to induce oligomerization of alpha-synuclein were analysed. The quantification of cerebrospinal fluid exosomal alpha-synuclein showed distinct differences between patients with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. In addition, exosomal alpha-synuclein levels correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment in cross-sectional samples from patients with dementia with Lewy bodies. Importantly, cerebrospinal fluid exosomes derived from Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies induce oligomerization of alpha-synuclein in a reporter cell line in a dose-dependent manner. Our data suggest that cerebrospinal fluid exosomes from patients with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies contain a pathogenic species of alpha-synuclein, which could initiate oligomerization of soluble alpha-synuclein in target cells and confer disease pathology.",

    "abstract": "Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) with specific surface coatings have been shown appropriate potential in the diagnosis and treatment of various brain diseases such as Alzheimer's. Comprehensive understanding of SPIONs interactions with amyloid beta (Abeta) and other amyloidogenic proteins is essential for their clinical application. SPIONs could be delivered to the target tissue under the magnetic field, while they might be influenced by the applied field. In this work, we exhibit the effect of different SPIONs (magnetized or non-magnetized with different surface charges) on the kinetics of Abeta fibrillation in aqueous solution by the aid of ThT assay. The results showed that applying of magnetic field to the SPIONs influences on the Abeta fibrillation because of its effect on the size due to surface charge. It was found that under magnetic field and high concentrations of nanoparticles (SPIONs-PEG-NH2), the Abeta fibrillation process accelerates, while at lower concentrations the fibrillation is inhibited. Furthermore, the coating charge has a considerable role in fibrillation process and the positively charged SPIONs/magnetized, at lower particle concentrations, accelerate the fibrillation compared with the negatively charged or uncharged SPIONs. This hints that SPIONs with a positive charge have dual effects on the Abeta fibrillation process. They influence on the concentration of monomeric protein in solution and thereby the nucleation time. Also, SPIONs have an effect on binding during the protein conformation.",

Abeta1-42 oligomers display a high degree of polymorphism, and several structurally different oligomers have been described. Amongst them, two types, recently classified as A+ and A-, have been shown to possess similar size but distinct toxic properties, as a consequence of their biophysical and structural differences. Here, we have investigated by means of single molecule tracking the oligomer mobility on the plasma membrane of living neuroblastoma cells and the interaction with the ganglioside GM1, a component of membrane rafts. We have found that A+ and A- oligomers display a similar lateral diffusion on the plasma membrane of living cells. However, only the toxic A+ oligomers appear to interact and alter the mobility of GM1. We have also studied the lateral diffusion of each kind of oligomers in cells depleted or enriched in GM1. We found that the content of GM1 influences the diffusion of both types of oligomer, although the effect of the increased levels of GM1 is higher for the A+ type. Interestingly, the content of GM1 also affects significantly the mobility of GM1 molecules themselves.",

Dissecting the biological effects of single amyloid-beta oligomers, for example of amyloid-beta dimers, an abundant amyloid-beta oligomer associated with clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease, has been difficult due to the inability to control the kinetics of amyloid-beta multimerization. For investigating the biological effects of amyloid-beta dimers, we stabilized amyloid-beta dimers by an intermolecular disulphide bridge via a cysteine mutation in the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta-S8C) of the amyloid precursor protein. This construct was expressed as a recombinant protein in cells and in a novel transgenic mouse, termed tgDimer mouse. This mouse formed constant levels of highly synaptotoxic soluble amyloid-beta dimers, but not monomers, amyloid-beta plaques or insoluble amyloid-beta during its lifespan. Accordingly, neither signs of neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation or cell death were observed. Nevertheless, these tgDimer mice did exhibit deficits in hippocampal long-term potentiation and age-related impairments in learning and memory, similar to what was observed in classical Alzheimer's disease mouse models. Although the amyloid-beta dimers were unable to initiate the formation of insoluble amyloid-beta aggregates in tgDimer mice, after crossbreeding tgDimer mice with the CRND8 mouse, an amyloid-beta plaque generating mouse model, Abeta-S8C dimers were sequestered into amyloid-beta plaques, suggesting that amyloid-beta plaques incorporate neurotoxic amyloid-beta dimers that by themselves are unable to self-assemble. Our results suggest that within the fine interplay between different amyloid-beta species, amyloid-beta dimer neurotoxic signalling, in the absence of amyloid-beta plaque pathology, may be involved in causing early deficits in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory that accompany Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Combined Plasma and Cerebrospinal Fluid Signature for the Prediction of Midterm Progression From Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer Disease.",
    "abstract": "Importance: A reliable method of detecting Alzheimer disease (AD) in its prodromal state is needed for patient stratification in clinical trials or for personalizing existing or potential upcoming therapies. Current cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)- or imaging-based single biomarkers for AD offer reliable identification of patients with underlying AD but insufficient prediction of the rate of AD progression. Objective: To optimize prediction of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD dementia by combining information from diverse patient variables. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) enrolled 928 patients with MCI at baseline and 249 selected variables available in the ADNI data set. Variables included clinical and demographic data, cognitive scores, magnetic resonance imaging-based brain volumetric data, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 homolog (TOMM40) genotypes, and analyte levels measured in the CSF and plasma. Data were collected in July 2012 and analyzed from July 1, 2012, to June 1, 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures: Progression from MCI to AD within 1 to 6 years. To determine whether combinations of markers could predict progression from MCI to AD within 1 to 6 years, the elastic net algorithm was used in an iterative resampling of a training- and test-based variable selection and modeling approach. Results: Among the 928 patients with MCI in the ADNI database, 94 had 224 of the required variables available for the modeling. The results showed the contributions of age, Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes composite test score, hippocampal volume, and multiple plasma and CSF factors in modeling progression to AD. A combination of apolipoprotein A-II and cortisol levels in plasma and fibroblast growth factor 4, heart-type fatty acid binding protein, calcitonin, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor 3 (TRAIL-R3) in CSF allowed for reliable prediction of disease status 3 years from the time of sample collection (80% classification accuracy, 88% sensitivity, and 70% specificity). Conclusions and Relevance: These study findings suggest that a combination of markers measured in plasma and CSF, distinct from beta-amyloid and tau, could prove useful in predicting midterm progression from MCI to AD dementia. Such a large-scale, multivariable-based analytical approach could be applied to other similar large data sets involving AD and beyond.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: LCZ696 (angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor) is a novel drug developed for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Neprilysin is one of multiple enzymes degrading amyloid-beta (Abeta). Its inhibition may increase Abeta levels. The potential exists that treatment of LCZ696, through the inhibition of neprilysin by LBQ657 (an LCZ696 metabolite), may result in accumulation of Abeta. The aim of this study was to assess the blood-brain-barrier penetration of LBQ657 and the potential effects of LCZ696 on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of Abeta isoforms in healthy human volunteers. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled study, healthy subjects received once daily LCZ696 (400 mg, n = 21) or placebo (n = 22) for 14 days. RESULTS: LCZ696 had no significant effect on CSF AUEC(0,36 h) of the aggregable Abeta species 1-42 or 1-40 compared with placebo (estimated treatment ratios 0.98 [95% CI 0.73, 1.34; P = 0.919] and 1.05 [95% CI 0.82, 1.34; P = 0.702], respectively). A 42% increase in CSF AUEC(0,36 h) of soluble Abeta 1-38 was observed (estimated treatment ratio 1.42 [95% CI 1.05, 1.91; P = 0.023]). CSF levels of LBQ657 and CSF Abeta 1-42, 1-40, and 1-38 concentrations were not related (r(2) values 0.022, 0.010, and 0.008, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: LCZ696 did not cause changes in CSF levels of aggregable Abeta isoforms (1-42 and 1-40) compared with placebo, despite achieving CSF concentrations of LBQ657 sufficient to inhibit neprilysin. The clinical relevance of the increase in soluble CSF Abeta 1-38 is currently unknown.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease-related phenotypes in mice can be rescued by blockade of either cellular prion protein or metabotropic glutamate receptor 5. We sought genetic and biochemical evidence that these proteins function cooperatively as an obligate complex in the brain. We show that cellular prion protein associates via transmembrane metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 with the intracellular protein mediators Homer1b/c, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and the Alzheimer's disease risk gene product protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta. Coupling of cellular prion protein to these intracellular proteins is modified by soluble amyloid-beta oligomers, by mouse brain Alzheimer's disease transgenes or by human Alzheimer's disease pathology. Amyloid-beta oligomer-triggered phosphorylation of intracellular protein mediators and impairment of synaptic plasticity in vitro requires Prnp-Grm5 genetic interaction, being absent in transheterozygous loss-of-function, but present in either single heterozygote. Importantly, genetic coupling between Prnp and Grm5 is also responsible for signalling, for survival and for synapse loss in Alzheimer's disease transgenic model mice. Thus, the interaction between metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 and cellular prion protein has a central role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and the complex is a potential target for disease-modifying intervention.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recently, an abnormal deposition of Amyloid-Beta (Abeta) was considered the primary cause of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). And how to inhibit the cytotoxicity is considered an important target for the treatment of AD. Triptolide (TP), a purified diterpenoid from the herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook.f. (TWHF), has potential neuroprotective effects pertinent to disease of the nervous system. However, whether triptolide and its specific mechanisms have protective functions in differentiated PC12 cells treated with Abeta25-35 remain unclear. AIMS: The purpose is to investigate the protective functions of triptolide in Abeta25-35-stimulated differentiated PC12 cells. MAIN METHODS: In the study, we use 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, flow cytometry assay, immunohistochemical staining and Western blot to observe the effects of triptolide on cytotoxicity induced by Abeta25-35 and its mechanism of oxidative stress. KEY FINDINGS: The result of MTT and LDH assay indicates that triptolide protected PC12 cells against Abeta25-35-induced cytotoxicity. The flow cytometry assay shows that triptolide attenuated Abeta25-35-induced apoptosis in differentiated PC12 cells. Meanwhile, the results give a clear indication that triptolide could downregulate generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) induced by Abeta25-35. The apoptotic process triggered by triptolide involved the up-regulation of the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that triptolide may serve as an important role in the inhibition of the cell apoptosis induced by Abeta and the decreased oxidative stress is a key mechanism in the protective effect of triptolide in AD.",

    "title": "Alterations in the Levels of Amyloid-beta, Phospholipid Hydroperoxide, and Plasmalogen in the Blood of Patients with Alzheimer's Disease: Possible Interactions between Amyloid-beta and These Lipids.",
    "abstract": "Aside from accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in the brain, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been reported as being associated with peroxidation of major phospholipids (e.g., phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho)) and degradation of antioxidative phospholipids (e.g., ethanolamine plasmalogen (PlsEtn)). In addition to its presence in the brain, Abeta is also found in blood; however, there is still little information about the levels of PtdCho hydroperoxide (PCOOH) and PlsEtn in the blood of patients with AD. In this study, by assuming a possible interaction among Abeta, PCOOH, and PlsEtn in blood circulation, we evaluated the levels of these molecules and correlations in blood samples that had been obtained from our former AD study for PCOOH measurement (Kiko et al., J Alzheimers Dis28, 593-600, 2012). We found that when compared to controls, plasma from patients with AD showed lower concentrations of PlsEtn species, especially PlsEtn bearing the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) moiety. In addition, lower PlsEtn and higher PCOOH levels were observed in red blood cells (RBCs) of patients with AD. In both AD and control blood samples, RBC PCOOH levels tended to correlate with plasma levels of Abeta40, and each PlsEtn species showed different correlations with plasma Abeta. These results, together with in vitro data suggesting Abeta aggregation due to a decrease in levels of PlsEtn having DHA, led us to deduce that Abeta is involved in alterations in levels of PCOOH and PlsEtn species observed in the blood of patients with AD.",

    "title": "Reduction of Amyloid-beta Plasma Levels by Hemodialysis: An Anti-Amyloid Treatment Strategy?",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment in hemodialysis patients is common, but the underlying pathogenesis remains unclear. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the general elderly population. Histopathological hallmarks are, among others, senile plaques, which consist of amyloid-beta (Abeta). OBJECTIVE: To measure plasma levels of Abeta42 and Abeta40 during hemodialysis and to examine potential associations with cognitive performance in cognitively impaired hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Plasma samples of 26 hemodialysis patients were collected shortly before, after 50% of dialysis time, and at the end of a dialysis session. Abeta42 and Abeta40 levels were measured by a high-sensitivity ELISA for human amyloid-beta. Cognition was tested under standardized conditions using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as proposed previously. RESULTS: Clearance rates of both peptides during one dialysis session were 22% and 35% for Abeta42 and Abeta40, respectively. Abeta42 but not Abeta40 baseline levels were significantly associated with MoCA test results (r = 0.654, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: In cognitively impaired hemodialysis patients plasma Abeta42 levels were associated with cognitive performance and both Abeta42 and Abeta40 plasma levels could be effectively reduced by dialysis. By inducing peripheral Abeta sink, hemodialysis may be considered as an anti-amyloid treatment strategy.",

    "abstract": "Recently we reported that several monoclonal antibodies that recognize linear segments of amyloid-beta (Abeta) also recognize amyloid fibrils, but not monomers of unrelated sequences, indicating that recognition of a linear sequence segment is not a reliable indicator of sequence specificity. We asked whether any of the commonly used commercially available Abeta antibodies also recognize fibrils of unrelated sequence. Here we report that 4G8, which recognizes residues 18-23 of the Abeta sequence and is widely believed to be sequence-specific, also recognizes fibrils formed from alpha-synuclein and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). The recognition of amyloid fibrils is aggregation-dependent because 4G8 does not recognize alpha-synuclein or IAPP monomer. 4G8 also stains fibrillar alpha-synuclein aggregates in human multiple system atrophy brain where it colocalizes with anti-alpha-synuclein monoclonal antibody LB509 immunoreactivity. We also found that LB509 recognizes Abeta fibrils, but not monomer, indicating that generic epitope-reactive antibodies are also produced in response to alpha-synuclein immunization. Taken together, our results indicate that generic fibril conformational epitope specificity may be a pervasive property among monoclonal antibodies raised against amyloid-forming antigens and that the specificity of their immunoreactivity should be rigorously established and otherwise interpreted with caution.",

We examined a total of 123 elderly participants without dementia and free of other neurological disorders or pathologies who at autopsy were classified as Braak NFT stages of I-V. We found that women were significantly more likely to have a high Braak score. Significant associations were found between high Braak scores and entorhinal cortex amyloid load, combined hippocampal and entorhinal cortex amyloid loads with perceptual speed in the low Braak group after adjusting for age, gender and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 status. Elderly with preserved cognitive function show a wide range of Braak scores and plaque pathology similar to that seen in prodromal and frank Alzheimer's disease at death. These data suggest that some older people with extensive NFT and plaque pathology demonstrate brain resilience or reserve leading to preserved cognitive function.",

    "abstract": "The recombinant C-terminal domain of tetanus toxin (Hc-TeTx) is a new non-toxic peptide of the tetanus toxin that exerts a protective action against glutamate excitotoxicity in motoneurons. Moreover, its efficacy as a neuroprotective agent has been demonstrated in several animal models of neurodegeneration. The eleven amino acids in the beta amyloid peptide (Abeta25-35) mimic the toxic effects of the full beta amyloid peptide (Abeta1-42), causing the impairment of the cholinergic system in the medial septum (MS) which, in turn, alters the septo-hippocampal pathway and leads to learning and memory impairments. The aim of this study was to examine the neuroprotective effects of the Hc-TeTx fragment against cholinotoxicity. The Hc-TeTx fragment (100 ng) was injected into the rats intercranially, with the Abeta(25-35) (2 mug) then injected into their MS. The animals were tested for spatial learning and memory in the eight-arm radial maze. The brains were removed to assess cholinergic markers, such as choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and to explore neurodegeneration in the MS and hippocampus, using amino-cupric silver and H&E staining. Finally, capase-3, a marker of apoptosis, was examined in the MS. Our results clearly demonstrate that the application of Hc-TeTx prevents the loss of cholinergic markers (ChAT and AChE), the activation of capase-3, and neurodegeneration in the MS and the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus. All these improvements were reflected in spatial learning and memory performance, and were significantly higher compared with animals treated with Abeta(25-35). Interestingly, the single administration of Hc-TeTx into the MS modified the ChAT and AChE expression that affect cognitive processes, without inducing neurodegeneration or an increase in capase-3 expression in the MS and hippocampus. In summary, our findings suggest that the recombinant Hc-TeTx fragment offers effective protection for the septo-hippocampal pathway, given that it reduces the neurodegeneration caused by Abeta(25-35) and improves learning and memory processes.",

Although plaque burden remains relatively stable through the clinical course of AD, whether these features of local plaque toxicity continue to worsen over the course of the disease is unclear. We performed an unbiased plaque-centered quantification of SMI312(+) dystrophic neurites, GFAP(+) reactive astrocytes, and IBA1(+) and CD68(+) activated microglia in randomly selected dense-core (Thioflavin-S(+)) plaques from the temporal neocortex of 40 AD subjects with a symptom duration ranging from 4 to 20 years, and nine nondemented control subjects with dense-core plaques. Dystrophic neurites (Kendall tau = 0.34, P = 0.001), reactive astrocytes (Kendall tau = 0.30, P = 0.003), and CD68(+) (Kendall tau = 0.48, P < 0.0001), but not IBA1 microglia (Kendall tau = 0.045, P = 0.655), exhibited a significant positive correlation with symptom duration. When excluding control subjects, only the positive association between CD68(+) microglia and symptom duration remained significant (Kendall tau = 0.39, P = 0.0003). The presence of the APOEepsilon4 allele did not affect these results. We conclude that plaques exert an increasing toxicity in the surrounding neuropil over the clinical course of AD, thereby potentially contributing to cognitive decline.",

In the present study, we established cellular models of AD in hESCs that overexpressed the mutant Presenilin 1 (PS1) gene with the use of a site-specific gene integration system. The overexpression of PS1 did not affect the undifferentiated status or the neural differentiation ability of the hESCs. We found increases in the ratios of amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42)/Abeta40 and Abeta43/Abeta40. Furthermore, synaptic dysfunction was observed in a cellular model of AD that overexpressed mutant PS1. These results suggest that the AD phenotypes, in particular, the electrophysiological abnormality of the synapses in our AD models might be useful for AD research and drug discovery.",

Copper coordinates chiefly to His residues and produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon redox cycling. ROS builds enormous burden on the normal functioning of neuronal cells and results into deleterious effects. Recently, two structurally distinct copper binding sites with contrasting redox properties were characterized. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the effect of binding of two equivalents of Cu(2+) on redox properties and cytotoxicity of Abeta peptide. Our electrochemical data and ascorbate consumption assay suggest that in the presence of two equivalents of copper; Abeta peptide has higher propensity of H2O2 generation. The oxidation of Abeta1-16 peptide due to both gamma radiolysis and metal catalyzed oxidation in the presence of two equivalents of copper is inhibited confirming the binding of both equivalents of copper to peptide.

    "abstract": "Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP, amylin) forms pancreatic amyloid in type-2 diabetes, a process that contributes to the loss of beta-cell mass in the disease. IAPP has been found in all higher organisms examined, but not all species form amyloid and the ability to do so correlates with the primary sequence. The amyloidogenic potential of fish IAPPs has not been examined, although fish have been proposed as a source for xenobiotic transplantation. The sequence of pufferfish IAPP (Takifugu rubripes) is known and is the most divergent from human IAPP of any reported IAPP sequence, differing at 11 positions including seven located within residues 20-29, a segment of the molecule that is important for controlling amyloidogenicity. Several of the substitutions found in pufferfish IAPP are nonconservative including Ser to Pro, Asn to Thr, Ala to Tyr, and Leu to Tyr replacements, and several of these have not been reported in mammalian IAPP sequences. Amyloid prediction programs give conflicting results for pufferfish IAPP. CD spectroscopy, FTIR, and transmission electron microscopy reveal that pufferfish IAPP forms amyloid and does so more rapidly than human IAPP in tris buffer at pH 7.4, but does so more slowly in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the pufferfish sequence is compatible with models of IAPP amyloid. The fish polypeptide does not significantly bind to thioflavin-T in tris and does so only weakly in PBS. The results highlight difficulties with thioflavin-T assays and the ambiguity in defining amyloidogenicity.",

    "abstract": "Filamentous beta-amyloid aggregates are crucial for the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Despite the tremendous biomedical importance, the molecular pathway of growth propagation is not completely understood and remains challenging to investigate by simulations due to the long time scales involved. Here, we apply extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water to obtain free energy profiles and kinetic information from position-dependent diffusion profiles for three different Abeta9-40-growth processes: fibril elongation by single monomers at the structurally unequal filament tips and association of larger filament fragments. Our approach provides insight into the molecular steps of the kinetic pathway and allows close agreement with experimental binding free energies and macroscopic growth rates. Water plays a decisive role, and solvent entropy is identified as the main driving force for assembly. Fibril growth is disfavored energetically due to cancellation of direct peptide-peptide interactions and solvation effects. The kinetics of growth is consistent with the characteristic dock/lock mechanism, and docking is at least 2 orders of magnitude faster. During initial docking, interactions are mediated by transient non-native hydrogen bonds, which efficiently catch the incoming monomer or fragment already at separations of about 3 nm. In subsequent locking, the dynamics is much slower due to formation of kinetically trapped conformations caused by long-lived non-native hydrogen bonds. Fibril growth additionally requires collective motion of water molecules to create a dry binding interface. Fibril growth is further retarded due to reduced mobility of the involved hydration water, evident from a 2-fold reduction of the diffusion coefficient.",

Pyroglutamate formation increases the rate of Abeta oligomerization and alters the interactions of Abeta with Cu(2+) and lipids; however, a link between these properties and the toxicity of pE-Abeta peptides has not been established. We report here that Abeta3pE-42 has an enhanced capacity to cause lipid peroxidation in primary cortical mouse neurons compared with the full-length isoform (Abeta(1-42)). In contrast, Abeta(1-42) caused a significant elevation in cytosolic reactive oxygen species, whereas Abeta3pE-42 did not. We also report that Abeta3pE-42 preferentially associates with neuronal membranes and triggers Ca(2+) influx that can be partially blocked by the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801. Abeta3pE-42 further caused a loss of plasma membrane integrity and remained bound to neurons at significantly higher levels than Abeta(1-42) over extended incubations. Pyroglutamate formation was additionally found to increase the relative efficiency of Abeta-dityrosine oligomer formation mediated by copper-redox cycling.",

The mechanism by which gamma-secretase selectively recognizes and recruits ectodomain-shed substrates for catalysis remains unclear. In contrast to previous reports that substrate is actively recruited for catalysis when its remaining short ectodomain interacts with the nicastrin component of gamma-secretase, we find that substrate ectodomain is entirely dispensable for cleavage. Instead, gamma-secretase-substrate binding is driven by an apparent tight-binding interaction derived from substrate transmembrane domain, a mechanism in stark contrast to rhomboid--another family of intramembrane-cleaving proteases. Disruption of the nicastrin fold allows for more efficient cleavage of substrates retaining longer ectodomains, indicating that nicastrin actively excludes larger substrates through steric hindrance, thus serving as a molecular gatekeeper for substrate binding and catalysis.",

    "abstract": "Oligomeric assemblies are postulated to be proximate neurotoxic species in human diseases associated with aberrant protein aggregation. Their heterogeneous and transient nature makes their structural characterization difficult. Size distributions of oligomers of several amyloidogenic proteins, including amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD), have been previously characterized in vitro by photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Due to non-physiological conditions associated with the PICUP chemistry, Abeta oligomers cross-linked by PICUP may not be representative of in vivo conditions. Here, we examine an alternative Copper and Hydrogen peroxide Induced Cross-linking of Unmodified Proteins (CHICUP), which utilizes naturally occurring divalent copper ions and hydrogen peroxide and does not require photo activation. Our results demonstrate that CHICUP and PICUP applied to the two predominant Abeta alloforms, Abeta40 and Abeta42, result in similar oligomer size distributions. Thioflavin T fluorescence data and atomic force microscopy images demonstrate that both CHICUP and PICUP stabilize Abeta oligomers and attenuate fibril formation. Relative to noncross-linked peptides, CHICUP-treated Abeta40 and Abeta42 cause prolonged disruption to biomimetic lipid vesicles. CHICUP-stabilized Abeta oligomers link the amyloid cascade, metal, and oxidative stress hypotheses of AD into a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of AD pathology. Because copper and hydrogen peroxide are elevated in the AD brain, CHICUP-stabilized Abeta oligomers are biologically relevant and should be further explored as a new therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "In order to evaluate potential therapeutic targets for treatment of amyloidoses such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is essential to determine the structures of toxic amyloid oligomers. However, for the amyloid beta-protein peptide (Abeta), thought to be the seminal neuropathogenetic agent in AD, its fast aggregation kinetics and the rapid equilibrium dynamics among oligomers of different size pose significant experimental challenges. Here we use ion-mobility mass spectrometry, in combination with electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and computational modeling, to test the hypothesis that Abeta peptides can form oligomeric structures resembling cylindrins and beta-barrels. These structures are hypothesized to cause neuronal injury and death through perturbation of plasma membrane integrity. We show that hexamers of C-terminal Abeta fragments, including Abeta(24-34), Abeta(25-35) and Abeta(26-36), have collision cross sections similar to those of cylindrins. We also show that linking two identical fragments head-to-tail using diglycine increases the proportion of cylindrin-sized oligomers. In addition, we find that larger oligomers of these fragments may adopt beta-barrel structures and that beta-barrels can be formed by folding an out-of-register beta-sheet, a common type of structure found in amyloid proteins.",

    "title": "Vascular cognitive impairment: Modeling a critical neurologic disease in vitro and in vivo.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is a complex form of dementia, combining aspects of vascular disease and other forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. VCID encompasses a wide spectrum of cerebrovascular-driven cognitive impairment, from mild cognitive impairment to fully developed dementia. This disease state is further complicated by metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension, and lifestyle factors, like obesity and high fat diets. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This manuscript is meant to both define VCID and review the in vitro and in vivo models of the disease state. This includes in vitro models of the neurovascular unit, models of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, animals with NOTCH3 mutations as a model of small vessel disease, large animals with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and animal models of mixed dementia. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Synthetic microvessels are a promising technique to study the neurovascular unit and canines, despite the cost, are an excellent model to study CAA. While there are several good models of individual aspects of VCID, the heterogeneity of the disease states prevents them from being a model of all aspects of the disease. Therefore, VCID needs to be further defined into disease states that exist within this umbrella term. This includes specific guidelines for stroke counts and stroke locations and further categorization of overlapping cerebrovascular and AD pathologies that contribute to dementia. This will allow for better models and a more thorough understanding of how vascular disease contributes to dementia. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: VCID is the second most common form of dementia and is expected to increase in coming years. The heterogeneity of VCID makes it difficult to study, but without better definitions and models, VCID presents a major public health problem for our aging population.

    "abstract": "The translocator protein of 18kDa (TSPO) is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and is involved in the cholesterol transport into the mitochondria and in the regulation of steroidogenesis, mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening and apoptosis. TSPO ligands have been investigated as therapeutic agents that promote neuroprotective effects in experimental models of brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to identify the neuroprotective effects of 4'-chlorodiazepam (4'-CD), a ligand of TSPO, against amyloid-beta (Abeta) in SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells and its mechanisms of action. Abeta decreased the viability of SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells, while 4'-CD had a neuroprotective effect at the doses of 1nM and 10nM. The neuroprotective effects of 4'-CD against Abeta were associated with the inhibition of Abeta-induced upregulation of Bax and downregulation of survivin. In summary, our findings indicate that 4'-CD is neuroprotective against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity by a mechanism that may involve the regulation of Bax and survivin expression.",

    "title": "Exosomal cellular prion protein drives fibrillization of amyloid beta and counteracts amyloid beta-mediated neurotoxicity.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a common neurodegenerative, progressive, and fatal disorder. Generation and deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides associate with its pathogenesis and small soluble Abeta oligomers show the most pronounced neurotoxic effects and correlate with disease initiation and progression. Recent findings showed that Abeta oligomers bind to the cellular prion protein (PrP(C) ) eliciting neurotoxic effects. The role of exosomes, small extracellular vesicles of endosomal origin, in Alzheimer's disease is only poorly understood. Besides serving as disease biomarkers they may promote Abeta plaque formation, decrease Abeta-mediated synaptotoxicity, and enhance Abeta clearance. Here, we explore how exosomal PrP(C) connects to protective functions attributed to exosomes in Alzheimer's disease. To achieve this, we generated a mouse neuroblastoma PrP(C) knockout cell line using transcription activator-like effector nucleases. Using these, as well as SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, we show that PrP(C) is highly enriched on exosomes and that exosomes bind amyloid beta via PrP(C) . Exosomes showed highest binding affinity for dimeric, pentameric, and oligomeric Abeta species. Thioflavin T assays revealed that exosomal PrP(C) accelerates fibrillization of amyloid beta, thereby reducing neurotoxic effects imparted by oligomeric Abeta. Our study provides further evidence for a protective role of exosomes in Abeta-mediated neurodegeneration and highlights the importance of exosomal PrP(C) in molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease. We show that the prion protein (PrP(C) ) on exosomes captures neurotoxic species of amyloid beta (Abeta) promoting its fibrillization. Our study provides evidence for a protective role of exosomes in Alzheimer`s disease and suggests that, depending on its membrane topology, PrP(C) holds a dual function: when expressed at the neuronal surface it acts as receptor for Abeta leading to neurotoxic signaling, whereas it detoxifies Abeta when present on exosomes. This provides further support for key roles of PrP(C) in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Propagation of Ass pathology: hypotheses, discoveries, and yet unresolved questions from experimental and human brain studies.",
    "abstract": "In brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Abeta peptides accumulate in parenchyma and, almost invariably, also in the vascular walls. Although Abeta aggregation is, by definition, present in AD, its impact is only incompletely understood. It occurs in a stereotypical spatiotemporal distribution within neuronal networks in the course of the disease. This suggests a role for synaptic connections in propagating Abeta pathology, and possibly of axonal transport in an antero- or retrograde way-although, there is also evidence for passive, extracellular diffusion. Striking, in AD, is the conjunction of tau and Abeta pathology. Tau pathology in the cell body of neurons precedes Abeta deposition in their synaptic endings in several circuits such as the entorhino-dentate, cortico-striatal or subiculo-mammillary connections. However, genetic evidence suggests that Abeta accumulation is the first step in AD pathogenesis. To model the complexity and consequences of Abeta aggregation in vivo, various transgenic (tg) rodents have been generated. In rodents tg for the human Abeta precursor protein, focal injections of preformed Abeta aggregates can induce Abeta deposits in the vicinity of the injection site, and over time in more distant regions of the brain. This suggests that Abeta shares with alpha-synuclein, tau and other proteins the property to misfold and aggregate homotypic molecules. We propose to group those proteins under the term \"propagons\". Propagons may lack the infectivity of prions. We review findings from neuropathological examinations of human brains in different stages of AD and from studies in rodent models of Abeta aggregation and discuss putative mechanisms underlying the initiation and spread of Abeta pathology.",

In this work, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated a new family of efficient NIR probes that target Abeta plaques by incorporating hydroxyethyl groups into the ligand structure. Among these probes, DANIR 8c showed excellent fluorescent properties with an emission maximum above 670 nm upon binding to Abeta aggregates and also displayed a high sensitivity (a 629-fold increase in fluorescence intensity) and affinity (Kd = 14.5 nM). Because of the improved hydrophilicity that was induced by hydroxyls, 8c displayed increased initial brain uptake and a fast washout from the brain, as well as an acceptable biostability in the brain. In vivo NIR fluorescent imaging revealed that 8c could efficiently distinguish between AD transgenic model mice and normal controls. Overall, 8c is an efficient and veritable NIR fluorescent probe for the in vivo detection of Abeta plaques in the brain.",

The near molecule pH generated by the intraparticle charge regulation phenomenon during the oligomerization of amyloid-beta (1-40) and (1-42) peptides is evaluated and discussed as a relevant mechanism supporting the \"amyloid cascade hypothesis\" proposed in the literature. A theoretical framework associated with the oligomerization of amyloid-beta peptides including simple scaling laws and the consideration of electrokinetic and hydrodynamic global properties of oligomers is presented. The central finding is the explanation of the near molecule pH change toward the pI when the oligomerization number increases. These results allow one to rationalize consecutive physical stages that validate the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Concluding remarks involving mainly the effects of pair and intraparticle charge regulation phenomena on the amyloidogenic pathway with some suggestions for future research are provided.",

    "abstract": "Besides its crucial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, the knowledge of amyloid precursor protein (APP) physiologic functions remains surprisingly scarce. Here, we show that APP regulates the transcription of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). APP-dependent regulation of GDNF expression affects muscle strength, muscular trophy, and both neuronal and muscular differentiation fundamental for neuromuscular junction (NMJ) maturation in vivo In a nerve-muscle coculture model set up to modelize NMJ formation in vitro, silencing of muscular APP induces a 30% decrease in secreted GDNF levels and a 40% decrease in the total number of NMJs together with a significant reduction in the density of acetylcholine vesicles at the presynaptic site and in neuronal maturation. These defects are rescued by GDNF expression in muscle cells in the conditions where muscular APP has been previously silenced. Expression of GDNF in muscles of amyloid precursor protein null mice corrected the aberrant synaptic morphology of NMJs. Our findings highlight for the first time that APP-dependent GDNF expression drives the process of NMJ formation, providing new insights into the link between APP gene regulatory network and physiologic functions.-Stanga, S., Zanou, N., Audouard, E., Tasiaux, B., Contino, S., Vandermeulen, G., Rene, F., Loeffler, J.-P., Clotman, F., Gailly, P., Dewachter, I., Octave, J.-N., Kienlen-Campard, P.

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) aggregates form the two discrete pathologies of Alzheimer disease (AD), and oligomeric assemblies of each protein are localized to synapses. To determine the sequence by which pathology appears in synapses, Abeta and p-tau were quantified across AD disease stages in parietal cortex. Nondemented cases with high levels of AD-related pathology were included to determine factors that confer protection from clinical symptoms. Flow cytometric analysis of synaptosome preparations was used to quantify Abeta and p-tau in large populations of individual synaptic terminals. Soluble Abeta oligomers were assayed by a single antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Total in situ Abeta was elevated in patients with early- and late-stage AD dementia, but not in high pathology nondemented controls compared with age-matched normal controls. However, soluble Abeta oligomers were highest in early AD synapses, and this assay distinguished early AD cases from high pathology controls. Overall, synapse-associated p-tau did not increase until late-stage disease in human and transgenic rat cortex, and p-tau was elevated in individual Abeta-positive synaptosomes in early AD. These results suggest that soluble oligomers in surviving neocortical synaptic terminals are associated with dementia onset and suggest an amyloid cascade hypothesis in which oligomeric Abeta drives phosphorylated tau accumulation and synaptic spread. These results indicate that antiamyloid therapies will be less effective once p-tau pathology is developed.",

    "abstract": "The prevention of 42-mer amyloid beta-protein (Abeta42) aggregation is promising for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We previously described the site-specific inhibitory mechanism for Abeta42 aggregation by a catechol-type flavonoid, (+)-taxifolin, targeting Lys16,28 after its autoxidation. In contrast, non-catechol-type flavonoids (morin, datiscetin, and kaempferol) inhibited Abeta42 aggregation without targeting Lys16,28 with almost similar potencies to that of (+)-taxifolin. We herein provided structural insights into their mechanisms for inhibiting Abeta42 aggregation. Physicochemical analyses revealed that their inhibition did not require autoxidation. The (1)H-(15)N SOFAST-HMQC NMR of Abeta42 in the presence of morin and datiscetin revealed the significant perturbation of chemical shifts of His13,14 and Gln15, which were close to the intermolecular beta-sheet region, Gln15-Ala21. His13,14 also played a role in radical formation at Tyr10, thereby inducing the oxidation of Met35, which has been implicated in Abeta42 aggregation. These results suggest the direct interaction of morin and datiscetin with the Abeta42 monomer. Although only kaempferol was oxidatively-degraded during incubation, its degradation products as well as kaempferol itself suppressed Abeta42 aggregation. However, neither kaempferol nor its decomposed products perturbed the chemical shifts of the Abeta42 monomer. Aggregation experiments using 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol-treated Abeta42 demonstrated that kaempferol and its degradation products inhibited the elongation rather than nucleation phase, implying that they interacted with small aggregates of Abeta42, but not with the monomer. In contrast, morin and datiscetin inhibited both phases. The position and number of hydroxyl groups on the B-ring of non-catechol-type flavonoids could be important for their inhibitory potencies and mechanisms against Abeta42 aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) is widely considered one of the early causes of cognitive deficits observed in Alzheimer's disease. Many of the deficits caused by Abeta are attributed to its disruption of synaptic function represented by its blockade of long-term potentiation (LTP) and its induction of synaptic depression. Identifying pathways that reverse these synaptic deficits may open the door to new therapeutic targets. In this study, we explored the possibility that Neurogranin (Ng)-a postsynaptic calmodulin (CaM) targeting protein that enhances synaptic function-may rescue Abeta-mediated deficits in synaptic function. Our results show that Ng is able to reverse synaptic depression and LTP deficits induced by Abeta. Furthermore, Ng's restoration of synaptic transmission is through the insertion of GluA1-containing alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid glutamate receptors (AMPARs). These restorative effects of Ng are dependent on the interaction of Ng and CaM and CaM-dependent activation of CaMKII. Overall, this study identifies a novel mechanism to rescue synaptic deficits induced by Abeta oligomers. It also suggests Ng and CaM signaling as potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease as well as important tools to further explore the pathophysiology underlying the disease.",

AD pathogenesis is tightly linked to the abnormal accumulation and aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta), seemingly the main causative factor of AD; however, intensive research on Abeta has not yet explained the complexity of AD pathogenesis. Consequently, the role of other supportive partners of Abeta have been elucidated and evaluated in the etiology of AD, and their potential molecular mechanisms have emerged as possible therapeutic targets. In this review, we compile information regarding Abeta-interacting partners in normal conditions and AD pathology, and analyze their etiological roles in diverse areas. Furthermore, we integrate this information into suggestions for probable clinical applications for AD diagnosis and therapeutics. We include Abeta-interacting partners localized to the cell surface and intracellular and extracellular compartments of different cell types ranging from the central nervous system to peripheral regions. Additionally, we expand the range of Abeta-interacting partners by including not only proteins, but also inorganic substances like metals, expecting that one of these partners may yield a critical breakthrough in the field of AD diagnostics and therapeutic drug development.",

    "abstract": "Alterations of the tightly interwoven neuron/astrocyte interactions are frequent traits of aging, but also favor neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD). These alterations reflect impairments of the innate responses to inflammation-related processes, such as beta-amyloid (Abeta) burdening. Multidisciplinary studies, spanning from the tissue to the molecular level, are needed to assess how neuron/astrocyte interactions are influenced by aging. Our study addressed this requirement by joining fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy/phasor multiphoton analysis with confocal microscopy, implemented with a novel method to separate spectrally overlapped immunofluorescence and Abeta autofluorescence. By comparing data from young control rats, chronically inflamed rats, and old rats, we identified age-specific alterations of neuron/astrocyte interactions in the hippocampus. We found a correlation between Abeta aggregation (+300 and +800% of aggregated Abeta peptide in chronically inflamed and oldvs.control rats, respectively) and fragmentation (clasmatodendrosis) of astrocyte projections (APJs) (+250 and +1300% of APJ fragments in chronically inflamed and oldvs.control rats, respectively). Clasmatodendrosis, in aged rats, associates with impairment of astrocyte-mediated Abeta clearance (-45% of Abeta deposits on APJs, and +33% of Abeta deposits on neurons in oldvs.chronically inflamed rats). Furthermore, APJ fragments colocalize with Abeta deposits and are involved in novel Abeta-mediated adhesions between neurons. These data define the effects of Abeta deposition on astrocyte/neuron interactions as a key topic in AD biology.-Mercatelli, R., Lana, D., Bucciantini, M., Giovannini, M.

    "title": "RPS23RG1 reduces Abeta oligomer-induced synaptic and cognitive deficits.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. It is generally believed that beta-amyloidogenesis, tau-hyperphosphorylation, and synaptic loss underlie cognitive decline in AD. Rps23rg1, a functional retroposed mouse gene, has been shown to reduce Alzheimer's beta-amyloid (Abeta) production and tau phosphorylation. In this study, we have identified its human homolog, and demonstrated that RPS23RG1 regulates synaptic plasticity, thus counteracting Abeta oligomer (oAbeta)-induced cognitive deficits in mice. The level of RPS23RG1 mRNA is significantly lower in the brains of AD compared to non-AD patients, suggesting its potential role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Similar to its mouse counterpart, human RPS23RG1 interacts with adenylate cyclase, activating PKA/CREB, and inhibiting GSK-3. Furthermore, we show that human RPS23RG1 promotes synaptic plasticity and offsets oAbeta-induced synaptic loss in a PKA-dependent manner in cultured primary neurons. Overexpression of Rps23rg1 in transgenic mice consistently prevented oAbeta-induced PKA inactivation, synaptic deficits, suppression of long-term potentiation, and cognitive impairment as compared to wild type littermates. Our study demonstrates that RPS23RG1 may reduce the occurrence of key elements of AD pathology and enhance synaptic functions to counteract oAbeta-induced synaptic and cognitive deficits in AD.",

    "abstract": "An increased level of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) is observed in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). AGEs and receptor for AGEs (RAGE) play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD. FPS-ZM1 is a high-affinity RAGE-specific blocker that inhibits amyloid-beta binding to RAGE, neurological damage and inflammation in the APP(sw/0) transgenic mouse model of AD. FPS-ZM1 is not toxic to mice and can easily cross the blood-brain barrier. In this study, an AGEs-RAGE-activated rat model were established by intrahippocampal injection of AGEs, then these rats were treated with intraperitoneal administration of FPS-ZM1 and the possible neuroprotective effects were investigated. We found that AGEs administration induced an-regulation of Abeta production, inflammation, and oxidative stress, and an increased escape latency of rats in the Morris water maze test, all of these are significantly reduced by FPS-ZM1 treatment. Our results suggest that the AGEs-RAGE pathway is responsible for cognitive deficits, and therefore may be a potential treatment target. FPS-ZM1 might be a novel therapeutic agent to treat AD patients.",

    "abstract": "Genetic, clinical, histopathological and biomarker data strongly support Beta-amyloid (Abeta) induced spreading of Tau-pathology beyond entorhinal cortex (EC), as a crucial process in conversion from preclinical cognitively normal to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), while the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In vivo preclinical models have reproducibly recapitulated Abeta-induced Tau-pathology. Tau pathology was thereby also induced by aggregated Abeta, in functionally connected brain areas, reminiscent of a prion-like seeding process. In this work we demonstrate, that pre-aggregated Abeta can directly induce Tau fibrillization by cross-seeding, in a cell-free assay, comparable to that demonstrated before for alpha-synuclein and Tau. We furthermore demonstrate, in a well-characterized cellular Tau-aggregation assay that Abeta-seeds cross-seeded Tau-pathology and strongly catalyzed pre-existing Tau-aggregation, reminiscent of the pathogenetic process in AD. Finally, we demonstrate that heterotypic seeded Tau by pre-aggregated Abeta provides efficient seeds for induction and propagation of Tau-pathology in vivo. Prion-like, heterotypic seeding of Tau fibrillization by Abeta, providing potent seeds for propagating Tau pathology in vivo, as demonstrated here, provides a compelling molecular mechanism for Abeta-induced propagation of Tau-pathology, beyond regions with pre-existing Tau-pathology (entorhinal cortex/locus coeruleus). Cross-seeding along functional connections could thereby resolve the initial spatial dissociation between amyloid- and Tau-pathology, and preferential propagation of Tau-pathology in regions with pre-existing 'silent' Tau-pathology, by conversion of a 'silent' Tau pathology to a 'spreading' Tau-pathology, observed in AD.",

Here we report in human and rodent tissues that elevated glucose, as found in MetS/T2DM, and oligomeric beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide, thought to be a key mediator of AD, coordinately increase neuronal Ca(2+) and nitric oxide (NO) in an NMDA receptor-dependent manner. The increase in NO results in S-nitrosylation of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), thus inhibiting insulin and Abeta catabolism as well as hyperactivating mitochondrial fission machinery. Consequent elevation in Abeta levels and compromise in mitochondrial bioenergetics result in dysfunctional synaptic plasticity and synapse loss in cortical and hippocampal neurons. The NMDA receptor antagonist memantine attenuates these effects. Our studies show that redox-mediated posttranslational modification of brain proteins link Abeta and hyperglycaemia to cognitive dysfunction in MetS/T2DM and AD.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation and activation of microglial cells is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative conditions. This mechanism is regulated by the activation of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), thus providing a target that may prevent the progression of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the study of microglial proliferation in Alzheimer's disease and validation of the efficacy of CSF1R-inhibiting strategies have not yet been reported. In this study we found increased proliferation of microglial cells in human Alzheimer's disease, in line with an increased upregulation of the CSF1R-dependent pro-mitogenic cascade, correlating with disease severity. Using a transgenic model of Alzheimer's-like pathology (APPswe, PSEN1dE9; APP/PS1 mice) we define a CSF1R-dependent progressive increase in microglial proliferation, in the proximity of amyloid-beta plaques. Prolonged inhibition of CSF1R in APP/PS1 mice by an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor (GW2580) resulted in the blockade of microglial proliferation and the shifting of the microglial inflammatory profile to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Pharmacological targeting of CSF1R in APP/PS1 mice resulted in an improved performance in memory and behavioural tasks and a prevention of synaptic degeneration, although these changes were not correlated with a change in the number of amyloid-beta plaques. Our results provide the first proof of the efficacy of CSF1R inhibition in models of Alzheimer's disease, and validate the application of a therapeutic strategy aimed at modifying CSF1R activation as a promising approach to tackle microglial activation and the progression of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Angiotensin-1-converting enzyme (ACE), a zinc metallopeptidase, consists of two homologous catalytic domains (N and C) with different substrate specificities. Here we report kinetic parameters of five different forms of human ACE with various amyloid beta (Abeta) substrates together with high resolution crystal structures of the N-domain in complex with Abeta fragments. For the physiological Abeta(1-16) peptide, a novel ACE cleavage site was found at His14-Gln15. Furthermore, Abeta(1-16) was preferentially cleaved by the individual N-domain; however, the presence of an inactive C-domain in full-length somatic ACE (sACE) greatly reduced enzyme activity and affected apparent selectivity. Two fluorogenic substrates, Abeta(4-10)Q and Abeta(4-10)Y, underwent endoproteolytic cleavage at the Asp7-Ser8 bond with all ACE constructs showing greater catalytic efficiency for Abeta(4-10)Y. Surprisingly, in contrast to Abeta(1-16) and Abeta(4-10)Q, sACE showed positive domain cooperativity and the double C-domain (CC-sACE) construct no cooperativity towards Abeta(4-10)Y. The structures of the Abeta peptide-ACE complexes revealed a common mode of peptide binding for both domains which principally targets the C-terminal P2' position to the S2' pocket and recognizes the main chain of the P1' peptide. It is likely that N-domain selectivity for the amyloid peptide is conferred through the N-domain specific S2' residue Thr358. Additionally, the N-domain can accommodate larger substrates through movement of the N-terminal helices, as suggested by the disorder of the hinge region in the crystal structures. Our findings are important for the design of domain selective inhibitors as the differences in domain selectivity are more pronounced with the truncated domains compared to the more physiological full-length forms.

    "title": "Validation of soluble amyloid-beta precursor protein assays as diagnostic CSF biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases.",
    "abstract": "Analytical validation of a biomarker assay is essential before implementation in clinical practice can occur. In this study, we analytically validated the performance of assays detecting soluble amyloid-beta precursor protein (sAPP) alpha and beta in CSF in two laboratories according to previously standard operating procedures serving this goal. sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta ELISA assays from two vendors (IBL-international, Meso Scale Diagnostics) were validated. The performance parameters included precision, sensitivity, dilutional linearity, recovery, and parallelism. Inter-laboratory variation, biomarker comparison (sAPPalpha vs. sAPPbeta) and clinical performance was determined in three laboratories using 60 samples of patients with subjective memory complaints, Alzheimer's disease, or frontotemporal dementia. All performance parameters of the assays were similar between labs and within predefined acceptance criteria. The only exceptions were minor out-of-range results for recovery at low concentrations and, despite being within predefined acceptance criteria, non-comparability of the results for evaluation of the dilutional linearity and hook-effect. Based on the inter-laboratory correlation between Lab #1 and Lab #2, the IBL-international assays were more robust (sAPPalpha: r(2) = 0.92, sAPPbeta: r(2) = 0.94) than the Meso Scale Diagnostics (MSD) assay (sAPPalpha: r(2) = 0.70, sAPPbeta: r(2) = 0.80). Specificity of assays was confirmed using assay-specific peptide competitors. Clinical validation showed consistent results across the clinical groups in the different laboratories for all assays. The validated sAPP assays appear to be of sufficient technical quality and perform well. Moreover, the study shows that the newly developed standard operating procedures provide highly useful tools for the validation of new biomarker assays. A recommendation was made for renewed instructions to evaluate the dilutional linearity and hook-effect. We analytically validated the performance of assays detecting soluble amyloid-beta precursor protein (sAPP) alpha and beta in CSF according to SOPs in agreement with ISO15189 guidelines. The validated sAPP assays appear to be of sufficient technical quality and perform well. Moreover, this study proofs that the newly developed SOPs, with a minor modification, provide highly useful tools for the validation of new biomarker assays.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Three (18)F-labeled radiopharmaceuticals have been Food and Drug Administration-approved for the identification of cortical amyloidosis in clinical settings. Although there has been strong debate among professionals as to the ethical and social consequences of disclosing such information, increasing numbers of participants are being recruited into secondary prevention trials for which they are likely to, and/or desire to, receive their positron emission tomography (PET) imaging results. METHODS: Healthy older adults (n = 63, mean age = 62 years) enrolled in a preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers trial, and 11 requested disclosure of PET amyloid imaging results to their treating neurologist, per institutional review board-approved study protocol. These individuals completed a follow-up psychoeducational program and structured interviews to assess impact of disclosure on several key psychological factors. RESULTS: Four of 11 subjects demonstrated increased amyloid aggregation and reported that they were not surprised, particularly given their family histories and subjective memory concerns. All indicated that they had shared this information with pertinent significant others; they were satisfied with their level of social support, and the imaging results had motivated them to change their lifestyle by exercising more, changing their diet, and planning ahead. Amyloid-positive participants showed little change in levels of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, subjective sense of memory impairment, or on measures of intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal, and reported risk of self-harm. DISCUSSION: Disclosure of PET amyloid status did not significantly impact mood, subjective sense of memory impairment, or perceived risk of developing AD; nor was this associated with significant emotional impact, irrespective of actual amyloid burden status. Those subjects with increased amyloid burden were more likely than those without significant amyloidosis to make positive changes to their lifestyle (e.g., engaging in more exercise and changing their diet).",

The thioflavin T (ThT) assay, turbidimetric analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) assay were used to study its potential inhibitory effect on Abeta aggregation. Our findings indicate that GGH was the specific chelating sequence and that the RYYAAFFARR (RR) component acted as an aggregation inhibitor. More importantly, GR significantly decreased the cytotoxicity of the Abeta-Cu(II) complex. The cell viability improved to 88%, which was higher than with the single functional peptide GGH and RR by 39% and 20%, respectively. Moreover, the qualitative effect of Cu(II) on the Abeta-Cu(II) complex was also studied. Our results indicate that Cu(II) induces the formation of the beta-sheet structure with a subequimolar Cu(II):Abeta molar ratio (0.25:1) but led to increased ROS production at a supra-equimolar ratio.",

For 8253 non-Hispanic white (NHW) and non-Hispanic black (NHB) Health and Retirement Study participants with memory scores measured 1 to 8 times between 1998 and 2012 (average baseline age=62), we calculated weighted polygenic risk scores [AD Genetic Risk Score (AD-GRS)] using the top 22 AD-associated loci, and an alternative score excluding apolipoprotein E (APOE) (AD-GRSexAPOE). We used generalized linear models with AD-GRS-by-age and AD-GRS-by-age interactions (age centered at 70) to predict memory decline. Average NHB decline was 26% faster than NHW decline (P<0.001). Among NHW, 10% higher AD-GRS predicted faster memory decline (linear beta=-0.058 unit decrease over 10 y; 95% confidence interval,-0.074 to -0.043). AD-GRSexAPOE also predicted faster decline for NHW, although less strongly. Among NHB, AD-GRS predicted faster memory decline (linear beta=-0.050; 95% confidence interval, -0.106 to 0.006), but AD-GRSexAPOE did not. Our nonsignificant estimate among NHB may reflect insufficient statistical power or a misspecified AD-GRS among NHB as an overwhelming majority of genome-wide association studies are conducted in NHW.

Molecular dynamics simulations are used to explore the conformational freedom of the peptide using LFMM combined with AMBER molecular mechanics parameters. We establish a modeling protocol, allowing for identification and analysis of favorable platinum-binding modes and peptide conformations. Preferred binding modes are identified for each ligand investigated; metal coordination occurs via Nepsilon in His residues for both ligands--His6epsilon-His13epsilon and His6epsilon-His14epsilon for the bipyridyl and phenanthroline ligands, respectively. The observed change in binding mode for the different ligands suggests that the binding mode of these platinum-based structures can be controlled by the choice of ligand. In the bipy systems, Boltzmann population at 310 K is dominated by a single conformer, while in the phenanthroline case, three conformations make significant contributions to the ensemble. The relative stability of these conformations is due to the inherent stability of binding platinum via Nepsilon in addition to subtle H-bonding effects.",

    "abstract": "Nearly 200 mutations in the gene coding for presenilin 1 (PSEN1) cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease, yet the molecular mechanism remains obscure. As a meta-analysis, we compiled available clinical and biochemical data for PSEN1 variants and correlated these to chemical properties of the mutants. We found statistically significant relationships between relative Abeta42 levels and clinical age of onset. We then computed chemical properties of the mutants from a variety of computational chemistry tools. Relative Abeta42 levels correlated significantly (95% confidence or more from p-values of linear regression) with loss of hydrophobicity for four different regression analyses (squared correlation coefficient of linear regression R(2) of 0.41-0.53) and with increased polarity (R(2) = 0.47, 0.59) and loss of protein stability (R(2) = 0.39, 0.63) for two independent data sets. Age of onset of patients carrying PSEN1 variants correlated with increased polarity (R(2) = 0.49, 0.40) and loss of stability (R(2) = 0.75, 0.44) of the protein for both data sets. These relations suggest that mutants impair the membrane-associated structural integrity of presenilin by reducing hydrophobic membrane association and overall protein stability. This explains why the many mutations that spread out across the protein and far from the catalytic aspartates can cause disease. The identified molecular determinants of clinical age of symptom onset may be relevant to future presenilin-modulating therapies specifically directed towards increasing the structural integrity and packing of the protein. Close to 200 mutations in presenilin 1 (PSEN1) cause Alzheimer's disease, but the biochemical relating these to disease remains debated. The chemical properties of PSEN1 variants were computed and correlated against clinical age of symptom onset. Loss of stability and hydrophobicity and gain of polarity relate to disease onset, suggesting that mutants impair the membrane structure of PSEN1 and that therapies should increase PSEN1 structural integrity.",

    "abstract": "Studies of presenilin (PSEN) gene mutations producing early onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) have helped elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of dementia and guided clinical trials of potential therapeutic interventions. Although familial and sporadic forms of AD share features, it is unclear if the two are precisely equivalent. In addition, PSEN mutations do not all produce a single phenotype, but exhibit substantial variability in clinical manifestations, which are related to the position and chemical nature of their amino acid substitutions as well as ratios of critical molecules such as Abeta40 and Abeta42. These differences complicate the interpretation of critical clinical trial results and their desired extrapolation to sporadic AD treatment. In this perspective, we examine differences between familial AD and sporadic AD as well as attributes shared by these uniquely arising disturbances in brain biochemical homeostasis that culminate in dementia.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Simvastatin (SV) has been reported to improve dementia and slow progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), however there are conflicting reports. OBJECTIVE & METHODS: Intracerebroventricular injection of aggregated Abeta1-42 in mice (Abeta1-42-mice) caused spatial cognitive deficits, long-term potentiation (LTP) impairment, and death of hippocampal pyramidal cells. The present study focused on exploring the dose-dependent effects of SV (10-80 mg/kg) on Abeta1-42-impaired spatial memory and the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: The treatment of Abeta1-42-mice with SV for continuous 15 days could attenuate the spatial cognitive deficits and recover the LTP induction in a \"U\" type dose-dependent manner. The death of pyramidal cells in Abeta1-42-mice was significantly reduced by the SV-treatment at 20 mg/kg, but not at a dose of 10 or 40 mg/kg, even was aggravated at a dose of 80 mg/kg. Hippocampal NMDA receptor (NMDAr) NR2B phosphorylation (phospho-NR2B) was elevated in Abeta1-42-mice, which was further dose-dependently increased by SV-treatment. Replenishment of isoprenoid farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) by applying farnesol (FOH) could abolish the SV-increased phospho-NR2B in Abeta1-42-mice, but had no effect on the Abeta1-42-enhanced phospho-NR2B. NMDAr antagonist blocked the neurotoxicity of Abeta1-42 and SV (80 mg/kg) in Abeta1-42-mice, whereas FOH only inhibited SV (80 mg/kg)-neurotoxicity. The SV-treatment in Abeta1-42-mice corrected the decrease in hippocampal Akt phosphorylation. The PI3K inhibitor abolished the SV (20 mg/kg)-neuroprotection in Abeta1-42-mice. CONCLUSION: SV-treatment in Abeta1-42-mice exerts dose-dependent neuroprotection and neurotoxicity by reducing FPP to enhance the phosphorylation of NR2B and Akt.",

Here we present an approach to investigate these factors through acquisition of highly reproducible data and global kinetic analysis to determine the mechanistic influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the Abeta aggregation network. This allows us to translate the shift in macroscopic aggregation behaviour into effects on the individual underlying microscopic steps. We apply this work-flow to the disease-associated Abeta42-A2V variant, and to a variation in pH as examples of an intrinsic and an extrinsic perturbation. In both cases, our data reveal a shift towards a mechanism in which a larger fraction of the reactive flux goes via a pathway that generates potentially toxic oligomeric species in a fibril-catalyzed reaction. This is in agreement with the finding that Abeta42-A2V leads to early-onset Alzheimer's disease and enhances neurotoxicity.",

    "title": "Astrocyte-Microglia Cross Talk through Complement Activation Modulates Amyloid Pathology in Mouse Models of Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Increasing evidence supports a role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, we identified a neuron-glia signaling pathway whereby Abeta acts as an upstream activator of astroglial nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), leading to the release of complement C3, which acts on the neuronal C3a receptor (C3aR) to influence dendritic morphology and cognitive function. Here we report that astrocytic complement activation also regulates Abeta dynamics in vitro and amyloid pathology in AD mouse models through microglial C3aR. We show that in primary microglial cultures, acute C3 or C3a activation promotes, whereas chronic C3/C3a treatment attenuates, microglial phagocytosis and that the effect of chronic C3 exposure can be blocked by cotreatment with a C3aR antagonist and by genetic deletion of C3aR. We further demonstrate that Abeta pathology and neuroinflammation in amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice are worsened by astroglial NF-kappaB hyperactivation and resulting C3 elevation, whereas treatment with the C3aR antagonist (C3aRA) ameliorates plaque load and microgliosis. Our studies define a complement-dependent intercellular cross talk in which neuronal overproduction of Abeta activates astroglial NF-kappaB to elicit extracellular release of C3. This promotes a pathogenic cycle by which C3 in turn interacts with neuronal and microglial C3aR to alter cognitive function and impair Abeta phagocytosis. This feedforward loop can be effectively blocked by C3aR inhibition, supporting the therapeutic potential of C3aR antagonists under chronic neuroinflammation conditions. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The complement pathway is activated in Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that the central complement factor C3 secreted from astrocytes interacts with microglial C3a receptor (C3aR) to mediate beta-amyloid pathology and neuroinflammation in AD mouse models. Our study provides support for targeting C3aR as a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Aberrant neural hyperactivity has been observed in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may be a driving force in the progression of amyloid pathology. Evidence for this includes the findings that neural activity may modulate beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide secretion and experimental stimulation of neural activity can increase amyloid deposition. However, whether long-term attenuation of neural activity prevents the buildup of amyloid plaques and associated neural pathologies remains unknown. Using viral-mediated delivery of designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), we show in two AD-like mouse models that chronic intermittent increases or reductions of activity have opposite effects on Abeta deposition. Neural activity reduction markedly decreases Abeta aggregation in regions containing axons or dendrites of DREADD-expressing neurons, suggesting the involvement of synaptic and nonsynaptic Abeta release mechanisms. Importantly, activity attenuation is associated with a reduction in axonal dystrophy and synaptic loss around amyloid plaques. Thus, modulation of neural activity could constitute a potential therapeutic strategy for ameliorating amyloid-induced pathology in AD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: A novel chemogenetic approach to upregulate and downregulate neuronal activity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice was implemented. This led to the first demonstration that chronic intermittent attenuation of neuronal activity in vivo significantly reduces amyloid deposition. The study also demonstrates that modulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) release can occur at both axonal and dendritic fields, suggesting the involvement of synaptic and nonsynaptic Abeta release mechanisms. Activity reductions also led to attenuation of the synaptic pathology associated with amyloid plaques. Therefore, chronic attenuation of neuronal activity could constitute a novel therapeutic approach for AD.",

    "title": "High amyloid-beta deposition related to depressive symptoms in older individuals with normal cognition: a pilot study.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have reported depressive symptoms in the preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The objective of this study was to determine whether depressive symptoms are associated with cortical amyloid burden. In order to do this, we measured cortical amyloid via (11) C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B ([(11) C]PIB) uptake using positron emission tomography (PET) in cognitively normal subjects. METHODS: We performed [(11) C]PIB-PET in 29 cognitively normal, older participants. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Abeta deposition was quantified by binding potential (BPND ), and the association between cortical mean BPND values and GDS scores was evaluated. Analysis of parametric BPND images was performed to examine the relationship between regional BPND and GDS scores. RESULTS: We found a positive correlation between depressive symptoms and mean cortical PIB-BPND in groups of subjects with middle to high PIB-BPND . There was little change in GDS-depression score between subjects with low and middle PIB-BPND levels, while an increase in GDS was shown in the high PIB-BPND group. The main BPND increase was localized to the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCu/PCC) in subjects with high PIB-BPND , and we found a significant positive relationship between PIB-BPND in this area and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Emotional dysregulation because of Abeta neuropathology in the PCu/PCC may relate to depressive symptoms. More specifically, we found that older, cognitively normal patients with depressive episodes were more likely to have underlying AD pathology. Thus, depressive symptoms may increase the predictive ability of the identification of future AD cases. Copyright   2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease involves accumulation of senile plaques in which filamentous aggregates of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides are deposited. Recent studies demonstrate that oligomerization pathways of Abeta peptides may be complicated. To understand the mechanisms of Abeta(1-42) oligomer formation in more detail, we have established a method to produce (15)N-labeled Abeta(1-42) suited for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies. For physicochemical studies, the starting protein material should be solely monomeric and all Abeta aggregates must be removed. Here, we succeeded in fractionating a \"precipitation-resistant\" fraction of Abeta(1-42) from an \"aggregation-prone\" fraction by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), even from bacterially overexpressed Abeta(1-42). However, both Abeta(1-42) fractions after 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) treatment formed amyloid fibrils. This indicates that the \"aggregation seed\" was not completely monomerized during HFIP treatment. In addition, Abeta(1-42) dissolved in HFIP was found to display a monomer-dimer equilibrium, as shown by two-dimensional (1)H-(15)N NMR. We demonstrated that the initial concentration of Abeta during the HFIP pretreatment altered the kinetic profiles of Abeta fibril formation in a thioflavin T fluorescence assay. The findings described here should ensure reproducible results when studying the Abeta(1-42) peptide.",

    "abstract": "Studies have shown that misfolded proteins and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress play pivotal roles in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has also been reported that ER stress is considered to be a common mediator of apoptosis in neurodegenerative disorders like AD. However, the precise mechanisms leading to neuronal cell death caused by ER stress in AD remain unclear. Hsp70, the major inducible form of the heat shock protein family, functions at the level of chaperone-mediated protein folding. Enhanced expression of Hsp70 suppresses the neurotoxicity caused by protein misfolding. EGb761, an accepted traditional Chinese medicine used to treat AD, was used here to examine the molecular mechanism underlying its protective effect on ER stress and Hsp70. Our study shows that pretreatment with EGb761 overcomes the neurotoxicity of the Abeta1-42 oligomer by increasing Hsp70, Grp78, IRE1alpha and pAkt expression in a dose-dependent manner and significantly decreases cell apoptosis-related protein expression. Our findings suggest that the neuroprotective effect of EGb761 is related to ER stress activation and increased Hsp70 expression, and subsequent activation of Akt. However, the effect of EGb761 on these processes is not direct.",

Spectral behavior of the fluorophores changed significantly (optical turn-on) upon binding to beta-amyloid aggregates. Computational studies were conducted to correlate the experimental Kd values with calculated binding energies, speculating the relationship between fluorophore structure and beta-amyloid affinity. In vivo studies demonstrated that PAD-2 could discriminate APP/PS1 transgenic mice from wild type controls, with specific labeling of cerebral beta-amyloid deposits confirmed by ex vivo observation.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide aggregation is the main molecular mechanism underlying the development of Alzheimer's disease, the most widespread form of senile dementia worldwide. Increasing evidence suggests that the key factor leading to impaired neuronal function is accumulation of water-soluble Abeta oligomers rather than formation of the senile plaques created by the deposition of large fibrillary aggregates of Abeta. However, several questions remain about the preliminary steps and the progression of Abeta oligomerization. METHODS: We show that the initial stages of the aggregation of fluorescently labeled Abeta can be determined with a high degree of precision and at physiological (i.e., nanomolar) concentrations by using either steady-state fluorimetry or time-correlated single-photon counting. RESULTS: We study the dependence of the oligomerization extent and rate on the Abeta concentration. We determine the chemical binding affinity of fluorescently labeled Abeta for liposomes that have been recently shown to be pharmacologically active in vivo, reducing the Abeta burden within the brain. We also probe their capacity to hinder the Abeta oligomerization process in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: We introduced a fluorescence assay allowing investigation of the earliest steps of Abeta oligomerization, the peptide involved in Alzheimer's disease. The assay proved to be sensitive even at Abeta concentrations as low as those physiologically observed in the cerebrospinal fluid. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This work represents an extensive and quantitative study on the initial events of Abeta oligomerization at physiological concentration. It may enhance our comprehension of the molecular mechanisms leading to Alzheimer's disease, thus paving the way to novel therapeutic strategies.",

Nicastrin contains a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane (TM) domain, and a short C-terminus. Its TM domain is important for the gamma-secretase complex formation. Here we report nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of the TM and C-terminal regions of human nicastrin in both sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles. Structural study and dynamic analysis reveal that the TM domain is largely helical and stable under both SDS and DPC micelles with its N-terminal region undergoing intermediate time scale motion. The TM helix contains a hydrophilic patch that is important for TM-TM interactions. The short C-terminus is not structured in solution and a region formed by residues V697-A702 interacts with the membrane, suggesting that these residues may play a role in the gamma-secretase complex formation. Our study provides structural insight into the function of the nicastrin TM domain and the C-terminus in gamma-secretase complex.",

When induced in mice with established pathology, this immunological response leads to clearance of cerebral amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and improved cognitive performance.

    "abstract": "Recently, we showed that rivastigmine decreased amyloid-beta (Abeta) brain load in aged rats by enhancing its clearance across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via upregulation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). Here, we extend our previous work to clarify P-gp role in mediating rivastigmine effect on Abeta brain levels and neuroprotection in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that expresses different levels of P-gp. APPSWE mice were bred with mdr1a/b knockout mice to produce littermates that were divided into three groups; APP(+)/mdr1(+/+), APP(+)/mdr1(+/-) and APP(+)/mdr1(-/-). Animals received rivastigmine treatment (0.3mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 8weeks using Alzet osmotic mini-pumps. ELISA analysis of brain homogenates for Abeta showed rivastigmine treatment to significantly decrease Abeta brain load in APP(+)/mdr1(+/+) by 25% and in APP(+)/mdr1(+/-) mice by 21% compared to their vehicle treated littermates, but not in APP(+)/mdr1(-/-) mice. In addition, rivastigmine reduced GFAP immunostaining of astrocytes by 50% and IL-1beta brain level by 43% in APP(+)/mdr1(+/+) mice, however its effect was less pronounced in P-gp knockout mice. Moreover, rivastigmine demonstrated a P-gp expression dependent neuroprotective effect that was highest in APP(+)/mdr1(+/+)>APP(+)/mdr1(+/-)>APP(+)/mdr1(-/-) as determined by expression of synaptic markers PSD-95 and SNAP-25 using Western blot analysis. Collectively, our results suggest that P-gp plays important role in mediating rivastigmine non-cholinergic beneficial effects, including Abeta brain load reduction, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in the AD mouse models.",

Abeta appears to skew synaptic plasticity events toward depression. We found that inhibition of PTEN, a lipid phosphatase that is essential to long-term depression, rescued normal synaptic function and cognition in cellular and animal models of Alzheimer's disease. Conversely, transgenic mice that overexpressed PTEN displayed synaptic depression that mimicked and occluded Abeta-induced depression. Mechanistically, Abeta triggers a PDZ-dependent recruitment of PTEN into the postsynaptic compartment. Using a PTEN knock-in mouse lacking the PDZ motif, and a cell-permeable interfering peptide, we found that this mechanism is crucial for Abeta-induced synaptic toxicity and cognitive dysfunction. Our results provide fundamental information on the molecular mechanisms of Abeta-induced synaptic malfunction and may offer new mechanism-based therapeutic targets to counteract downstream Abeta signaling.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta)-induced neuronal toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the precise mechanism(s) of Abeta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction has not been fully understood. There is evidence that Forkhead box O3a (FOXO3a) is normally present in neuronal mitochondria. Using HT22 murine hippocampal neuronal cells and primary hippocampal neurons, the present study investigated whether mitochondrial FOXO3a was involved in mitochondrial dysfunction induced by Abeta. It was found that Abeta induced dephosphorylation and mitochondrial translocation of FOXO3a. In addition, Abeta enhanced association of FOXO3a with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), causing a decrease in the expression of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COX1) and the activity of COX. In addition, Abeta-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, indicated by the decrease in 3- (4,5-cimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) conversion, mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and COX activity, could be suppressed by knockdown of FOXO3a (FOXO3a-KD). These results provide new insights into the mechanism underlying Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and open up new therapeutic perspectives for AD.",

    "title": "Improved proteostasis in the secretory pathway rescues Alzheimer's disease in the mouse.",
    "abstract": "The aberrant accumulation of toxic protein aggregates is a key feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. As such, improving normal proteostatic mechanisms is an active target for biomedical research. Although they share common pathological features, protein aggregates form in different subcellular locations. Nepsilon-lysine acetylation in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum has recently emerged as a new mechanism to regulate the induction of autophagy. The endoplasmic reticulum acetylation machinery includes AT-1/SLC33A1, a membrane transporter that translocates acetyl-CoA from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, and ATase1 and ATase2, two acetyltransferases that acetylate endoplasmic reticulum cargo proteins. Here, we used a mutant form of alpha-synuclein to show that inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum acetylation machinery specifically improves autophagy-mediated disposal of toxic protein aggregates that form within the secretory pathway, but not those that form in the cytosol. Consequently, haploinsufficiency of AT-1/SLC33A1 in the mouse rescued Alzheimer's disease, but not Huntington's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In fact, intracellular toxic protein aggregates in Alzheimer's disease form within the secretory pathway while in Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis they form in different cellular compartments. Furthermore, biochemical inhibition of ATase1 and ATase2 was also able to rescue the Alzheimer's disease phenotype in a mouse model of the disease. Specifically, we observed reduced levels of soluble amyloid-beta aggregates, reduced amyloid-beta pathology, reduced phosphorylation of tau, improved synaptic plasticity, and increased lifespan of the animals. In conclusion, our results indicate that Nepsilon-lysine acetylation in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen regulates normal proteostasis of the secretory pathway; they also support therapies targeting endoplasmic reticulum acetyltransferases, ATase1 and ATase2, for a subset of chronic degenerative diseases.",

We report herein the capacity of sugar-based peptidomimetics to inhibit both Abeta1-42 early oligomerization and fibrillization. A wide range of bio- and physicochemical techniques, such as a new capillary electrophoresis method, nuclear magnetic resonance, and surface plasmon resonance, were used to identify how these new molecules can delay the aggregation of Abeta1-42. We demonstrate that these molecules interact with soluble oligomers in order to maintain the presence of nontoxic monomers and to prevent fibrillization. These compounds totally suppress the toxicity of Abeta1-42 toward SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, even at substoichiometric concentrations. Furthermore, demonstration that the best molecule combines hydrophobic moieties, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, ammonium groups, and a hydrophilic beta-sheet breaker element provides valuable insight for the future structure-based design of inhibitors of Abeta1-42 aggregation.",

    "title": "Short Fibrils Constitute the Major Species of Seed-Competent Tau in the Brains of Mice Transgenic for Human P301S Tau.",
    "abstract": "The interneuronal propagation of aggregated tau is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of human tauopathies. It requires the uptake of seed-competent tau into cells, seeding of soluble tau in recipient neurons and release of seeded tau into the extracellular space to complete the cycle. At present, it is not known which tau species are seed-competent. Here, we have dissected the molecular characteristics of seed-competent tau species from the TgP301S tau mouse model using various biochemical techniques and assessed their seeding ability in cell and animal models. We found that sucrose gradient fractions from brain lysates seeded cellular tau aggregation only when large (>10 mer) aggregated, hyperphosphorylated (AT8- and AT100-positive) and nitrated tau was present. In contrast, there was no detectable seeding by fractions containing small, oligomeric (<6 mer) tau. Immunodepletion of the large aggregated AT8-positive tau strongly reduced seeding; moreover, fractions containing these species initiated the formation and spreading of filamentous tau pathology in vivo, whereas fractions containing tau monomers and small oligomeric assemblies did not. By electron microscopy, seed-competent sucrose gradient fractions contained aggregated tau species ranging from ring-like structures to small filaments. Together, these findings indicate that a range of filamentous tau aggregates are the major species that underlie the spreading of tau pathology in the P301S transgenic model. Significance statement: The spread of tau pathology from neuron to neuron is postulated to account for, or at least to contribute to, the overall propagation of tau pathology during the development of human tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease. It is therefore important to characterize the native tau species responsible for this process of seeding and pathology spreading. Here, we use several biochemical techniques to dissect the molecular characteristics of native tau protein conformers from TgP301S tau mice and show that seed-competent tau species comprise small fibrils capable of seeding tau pathology in cell and animal models. Characterization of seed-competent tau gives insight into disease mechanisms and therapeutic interventions.",

On the 21st postnatal day, On the PND21, the learning and memory ability were tested by water maze test and the Pb levels were also determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The expression of IDE, IGF2 and Abeta40 in cerebral cortex was examined by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and western blotting. The lead levels in blood and cerebral cortex of all lead exposure groups were significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). In water maze test, the performances of 0.5% and 1% lead exposure groups were worse than that of the control group (P<0.05).The expression of IDE and IGF2 was decreased, but Abeta40 was increased in lead exposed groups than that of the control group (P<0.05).

The current study investigated effects of amyloid dysmetabolism on the microstructure of WMHs in subjects with MCI or subjective cognitive decline (N = 51), dichotomized according to pathological or normal levels of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta42) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Thirty-one subjects with low CSF Abeta42 (Abeta+) and 20 subjects with normal CSF Abeta42 (Abeta-) were assessed with magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (DR), axial diffusivity (DA), and mean diffusivity (MD) were determined. There were no significant differences in WMH volume or distribution between the groups, and neither age nor WMH volume had significant impact on the DTI indices. Nevertheless, there were significantly higher DA, DR, and MD in WMHs in Abeta+ relative to Abeta-; however, no differences in FA were found. The present results suggest that amyloid accumulation is associated with impaired structural integrity (e.g. relating to more extensive demyelination and loss of axons) in WMHs putatively adding to effects of ischemia.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) exerts important functions in the regulation of monocytes, like dendritic cells, osteoclasts, tissue macrophages, and microglia. Mutations in TREM2 are associated with several diseases, including Nasu-Hakola disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). TREM2 undergoes sequential proteolytic processing by ectodomain shedding and intramembrane proteolysis. FINDINGS: We show that inhibition of gamma-secretase-dependent cleavage of the TREM2 C-terminal fragment in cellular membranes interferes with TREM2-dependent signaling and cellular function. Inhibition of gamma-secretase decreases membrane-proximal signaling and intracellular Ca(2+) response. Decreased signaling alters morphological changes and phagocytic activity of cells upon selective stimulation of TREM2. CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate the importance of gamma-secretase-dependent intramembrane processing in TREM2-mediated signaling and, thus, a functional relation of two AD-associated proteins.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a frequently observed feature of Alzheimer's disease, but its pathological significance is not understood. To explore the relationship between oxidative stress and amyloid plaques, uniformly radiolabeled arachidonate was introduced into transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease via intracerebroventricular injection. Uniform labeling with carbon-14 is used here for the first time, and made possible meaningful quantification of arachidonate oxidative degradation products. The injected arachidonate entered a fatty acid pool that was subject to oxidative degradation in both transgenic and wild-type animals. However, the extent of its degradation was markedly greater in the hippocampus of transgenic animals where amyloid plaques were abundant. In human Alzheimer's brain, plaque-associated proteins were post-translationally modified by hydroxynonenal, a well-known oxidative degradation product of arachidonate. These results suggest that several recurring themes in Alzheimer's pathogenesis, amyloid beta proteins, transition metal ions, oxidative stress, and apolipoprotein isoforms, may be involved in a common mechanism that has the potential to explain both neuronal loss and fibril formation in this disease.",

    "title": "Beta-amyloid and phosphorylated tau metabolism changes in narcolepsy over time.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim od this study is to test whether metabolism of beta-amyloid and tau proteins changes in narcolepsy along with the disease course. METHODS: We analyzed a population of narcoleptic drug-naive patients compared to a sample of healthy controls. Patients and controls underwent lumbar puncture for assessment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-amyloid1-42 (Abeta42), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels. Moreover, based on the median disease duration of the whole narcolepsy group, the patients were divided into two subgroups: patients with a short disease duration (SdN, <5 years) and patients with a long disease duration (LdN, >5 years). RESULTS: We found significantly lower CSF Abeta42 levels in the whole narcolepsy group with respect to controls. Taking into account the patient subgroups, we documented reduced CSF Abeta42 levels in SdN compared to both LdN and controls. Even LdN patients showed lower CSF Abeta42 levels with respect to controls. Moreover, we documented higher CSF p-tau levels in LdN patients compared to both SdN and controls. Finally, a significant positive correlation between CSF Abeta42 levels and disease duration was evident. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that beta-amyloid metabolism and cascade may be impaired in narcolepsy not only at the onset but also along with the disease course, although they show a compensatory profile over time. Concurrently, also CSF biomarkers indicative of neural structure (p-tau) appear to be altered in narcolepsy patients with a long disease duration. However, the mechanism underlying beta-amyloid and tau metabolism impairment in narcolepsy remains still unclear and deserves to be better elucidated.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of senile plaques consisting of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) is a major neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously developed and characterized monoclonal antibodies 31-2 and 75-2 that specifically bind to nonfibrillar Abeta1-42 aggregates with diameters of more than 220 and 50 nm, respectively. Here, we report the use of these antibodies to examine the aggregation of exogenous Abeta1-42 in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. From 6 to 24 h after transfection of Abeta1-42, antibody 75-2 immunolabeled almost all transfected neurons, whereas 31-2-positive cells were restricted to a part of the transfected neurons and gradually increased in number. Expression of the F19S/L34P-mutant Abeta1-42, which showed less of a tendency to aggregate, resulted in clearly reduced immunoreactivity to both antibodies. We also immunohistochemically investigated the temporal cortices of patients with AD and found that 31-2 preferentially labeled the cores of a subpopulation of large amyloid plaques. The relative number of 31-2-immunoreactive plaques was found to correlate with the Braak stages of neurofibrillary tangles, but not with that of amyloid plaques. These results suggest that 31-2-reactive Abeta aggregates develop with a delayed time course in cultured neurons and amyloid plaques of AD brains.",

METHODS: Quantitative targeted metabolomics in serum using an identical method as in the index study. RESULTS: We failed to replicate these findings in a substantially larger study from two independent cohorts-the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging ([BLSA], n = 93, AUC = 0.642, sensitivity/specificity of 51.6%/65.7%) and the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study ([AGES-RS], n = 100, AUC = 0.395, sensitivity/specificity of 47.0%/36.0%). In analyses applying machine learning methods to all 187 metabolite concentrations assayed, we find a modest signal in the BLSA with distinct metabolites associated with the preclinical and symptomatic stages of AD, whereas the same methods gave poor classification accuracies in the AGES-RS samples.

RESULTS: Patients with AD exhibit low mtDNA content in CSF compared with patients diagnosed with sCJD or with non-Alzheimer's type dementias. The CSF concentration of mtDNA does not correlate with Abeta, t-tau, p-tau, and 14-3-3 protein levels in CSF.

    "abstract": "In this study, we update the TDP-43 in Alzheimer's disease staging scheme by assessing the topography of TDP-43 in 193 cases of Alzheimer's disease, in 14 different brain regions (eight previously described plus six newly reported) and use conditional probability to model the spread of TDP-43 across the 14 brain regions. We show that in addition to the eight original regions we previously reported [amygdala, entorhinal cortex, subiculum, dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, occipitotemporal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, middle frontal cortex and basal ganglia (putamen/globus pallidum)] that TDP-43 is also deposited in the insular cortex, ventral striatum, basal forebrain, substantia nigra, midbrain tectum, and the inferior olive of the medulla oblongata, in Alzheimer's disease. The conditional probability analysis produced six significantly different stages (P < 0.01), and suggests that TDP-43 deposition begins in the amygdala (stage 1), then moves to entorhinal cortex and subiculum (stage 2); to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and occipitotemporal cortex (stage 3); insular cortex, ventral striatum, basal forebrain and inferior temporal cortex (stage 4); substantia nigra, inferior olive and midbrain tectum (stage 5); and finally to basal ganglia and middle frontal cortex (stage 6). This updated staging scheme is superior to our previous staging scheme, classifying 100% of the cases (versus 94% in the old scheme), based on criteria provided, and shows clinical significance with some regions and with increasing stage. We discuss the relevance of the updated staging scheme, as well as its impact on the prion-like hypothesis of protein spread in neurodegenerative disease. We also address the issue of whether frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 could be the primary pathology in stage 6.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition in brain with subsequent formation of neuritic plaques leading to dementia. A number of therapeutic strategies targeted against Abeta depositions have been rigorously explored which provided successful results corresponding to the existing symptomatic treatments. However, at the same time, several failures corresponding to the disease altering therapies and drugs have also been observed due to potential drawbacks in understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, development of drug candidates and subsequent designing of clinical trials. Preclinical research, along with experimental and clinical studies, is continuously providing novel information which may reveal multi-target directed ligands and combination therapies for targeting Abeta. Thus, in view of the estimated increase in the number of AD patients globally, the present review attempts to summarize the available evidence dealing with various therapeutic approaches targeting Abeta, focusing specifically on pharmaceutical compounds under various stages of clinical trials. Furthermore, in view of a number of computational advances having significant impact in the field of computer aided drug design, we have also presented results of analysis of natural compounds as potential therapeutic molecules in preventing Abeta plaque formation using in silico approaches.",

    "title": "Myeloid dendritic cells are decreased in peripheral blood of Alzheimer's disease patients in association with disease progression and severity of depressive symptoms.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dendritic cells (DCs) are major orchestrators of immune responses and inflammation. They are migratory cells, which may play a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), as suggested by prior in vitro studies. With the intent to investigate the clinical relevance of DC modifications in vivo, the present study was aimed to evaluate the levels of blood DCs in AD patients, in relation to the progression of the disease, the severity of its symptoms, and the treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs), a class of drugs used to improve cognitive functioning in people with dementia. METHODS: The two main subpopulations of immature blood DCs, namely myeloid (mDCs) and plasmacytoid (pDCs) cells, were evaluated by flow cytometry analysis in 106 AD patients, in comparison with the same cells from 65 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 73 healthy control subjects (HC). The relationship between blood DC levels and symptom severity was also assessed in AD patients, and their blood DC frequency was considered both in the absence or presence of treatment with AChEIs. RESULTS: A significant depletion in blood mDCs was observed in AD patients, as compared to HC and MCI subjects. At variance, pDC levels were comparable among the three groups of subjects. The mDC decrease was evident only after the emergence of AD clinical symptoms, as confirmed by the follow-up analysis of a subgroup of MCI subjects who exhibited a significant decline in mDCs after their conversion to AD. Notably, the mDC decline was inversely correlated in AD patients with the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms. Eventually, the mDC depletion was not observable in patients treated with AChEIs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide the first evidence that blood mDC levels are dysregulated in AD. This phenomenon appears mainly linked to AD progression, associated with stronger severity of AD-related symptoms, and influenced by AChEI treatment. Taken all together, these data suggest that blood mDCs may serve as a cell source to test disease-induced and treatment-related changes and support the innovative notion that DCs play a role in AD, as ultimate evidence of the immune system participation in disease progression.",

Further, we present the first multi-modal analysis of blood markers in this field. We used blood plasma samples from 91 subjects enrolled in the University of California, San Francisco Alzheimer's Disease Research Centre. Non-targeted metabolomic analysis was used to look for associations with NAB using both single and multiple metabolic feature models. Five metabolic features identified subjects with high NAB, with 72% accuracy. We were able to putatively identify four metabolites from this panel and improve the model further by adding fibrinogen gamma chain protein measures (accuracy=79%). One of the five metabolic features was studied in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort, but results were inconclusive. If replicated in larger, independent studies, these metabolic features and proteins could form the basis of a blood test with potential for enrichment of amyloid pathology in anti-amyloid trials.",

    "abstract": "QUESTIONS UNDER STUDY: Alzheimer-type amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology was reported in brains of individuals developing iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (iCJD) after treatment with human cadaveric growth hormone, and interpreted as evidence of human transmission of Abeta by the treatment. Here we investigated the prevalence of Abeta pathology in other instances of iCJD related to dura mater grafts. METHODS: By use of immunohistochemistry for Abeta, we investigated seven brains of patients (age range 28-63) who succumbed to iCJD after dural grafting, which had been applied by means of neurosurgery between 11 and 25 years before death. For control, we examined a series of 21 brains of age-matched (40-63 years) patients with sporadic CJD (sCJD) and an additional series of 81 sCJD cases (55-85 years) with the same methods. RESULTS: In five of seven iCJD brains, Abeta was deposited in meningeal vessels as congophilic amyloid angiopathy and brain parenchymal plaques. This was significantly (p <0.001) more frequent than in the age-matched sCJD controls and in the usual sCJD series. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that congophilic amyloid angiopathy and brain parenchymal Abeta plaques are frequent in iCJD after dural grafting. The presence of Abeta pathology in young individuals is highly unusual and suggests a causal relationship to the dural grafts. Further studies will be needed to elucidate whether such pathology resulted from the seeding of Abeta aggregates from the grafts to host tissues.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence has established the colocalization of amyloid-rich plaques and heme-rich deposits in the human cerebral cortex as a common postmortem feature in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides have been shown to bind heme, and the resultant heme-Abeta complexes can generate toxic partially reduced oxygen species (PROS) and exhibit peroxidase activity. The heme-Abeta active site exhibits a concentration-dependent equilibrium between a high-spin mono-His-bound species similar to a peroxidase-type active site and a bis-His-bound six-coordinate low-spin species similar to that of a cytochrome b type active site. The nu(Fe-His) (241 cm(-1)) vibration has been identified in the high-spin heme-Abeta active site by resonance Raman spectroscopy. The formation of the low-spin heme-Abeta species is promoted by the His14 and noncoordinating second-sphere Arg5 residues. The high-spin state produces more PROS than the low-spin species. Nonbiological constructs modeling different forms of Abeta (oligomers, fibrils, etc.) suggest that the detrimental high-spin state is likely to dominate under most physiological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Brains affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) show a large spectrum of mitochondrial alterations at both morphological and genetic level. The causal link between beta-amyloid (Abeta) and mitochondrial dysfunction has been established in cellular models of AD. We observed previously that lycopene, a member of the carotenoid family of phytochemicals, could counteract neuronal apoptosis and cell damage induced by Abeta and other neurotoxic substances, and that this neuroprotective action somehow involved the mitochondria. The present study aims to investigate the effects of lycopene on mitochondria in cultured rat cortical neurons exposed to Abeta. It was found that lycopene attenuated Abeta-induced oxidative stress, as evidenced by the decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species generation and mitochondria-derived superoxide production. Additionally, lycopene ameliorated Abeta-induced mitochondrial morphological alteration, opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pores and the consequent cytochrome c release. Lycopene also improved mitochondrial complex activities and restored ATP levels in Abeta-treated neuron. Furthermore, lycopene prevented mitochondrial DNA damages and improved the protein level of mitochondrial transcription factor A in mitochondria. Those results indicate that lycopene protects mitochondria against Abeta-induced damages, at least in part by inhibiting mitochondrial oxidative stress and improving mitochondrial function. These beneficial effects of lycopene may account for its protection against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity.",

    "title": "Conformational Changes in Transmembrane Domain 4 of Presenilin 1 Are Associated with Altered Amyloid-beta 42 Production.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: gamma-Secretase is an intramembrane-cleaving protease that produces amyloid-beta peptide 42 (Abeta42), which is the toxic and aggregation-prone species of Abeta that causes Alzheimer's disease. Here, we used the substituted cysteine accessibility method to analyze the structure of transmembrane domains (TMDs) 4 and 5 of human presenilin 1 (PS1), a catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase. We revealed that TMD4 and TMD5 face the intramembranous hydrophilic milieu together with TMD1, TMD6, TMD7, and TMD9 of PS1 to form the catalytic pore structure. Notably, we found a correlation in the distance between the cytosolic sides of TMD4/TMD7 and Abeta42 production levels, suggesting that allosteric conformational changes of the cytosolic side of TMD4 affect Abeta42-generating gamma-secretase activity. Our results provide new insights into the relationship between the structure and activity of human PS1. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Modulation of gamma-secretase activity to reduce toxic amyloid-beta peptide species is one plausible therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease. However, precise mechanistic information of gamma-secretase still remains unclear. Here we identified the conformational changes in transmembrane domains of presenilin 1 that affect the proteolytic activity of the gamma-secretase. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the structural dynamics of presenilin 1 in drug development against Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Higher brain BDNF gene expression is associated with slower cognitive decline in older adults.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We tested whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene expression levels are associated with cognitive decline in older adults. METHODS: Five hundred thirty-five older participants underwent annual cognitive assessments and brain autopsy at death. BDNF gene expression was measured in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Linear mixed models were used to examine whether BDNF expression was associated with cognitive decline adjusting for age, sex, and education. An interaction term was added to determine whether this association varied with clinical diagnosis proximate to death (no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia). Finally, we examined the extent to which the association of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology with cognitive decline varied by BDNF expression. RESULTS: Higher brain BDNF expression was associated with slower cognitive decline (p < 0.001); cognitive decline was about 50% slower with the 90th percentile BDNF expression vs 10th. This association was strongest in individuals with dementia. The level of BDNF expression was lower in individuals with pathologic AD (p = 0.006), but was not associated with macroscopic infarcts, Lewy body disease, or hippocampal sclerosis. BDNF expression remained associated with cognitive decline in a model adjusting for age, sex, education, and neuropathologies (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the effect of AD pathology on cognitive decline varied by BDNF expression such that the effect was strongest for high levels of AD pathology (p = 0.015); thus, in individuals with high AD pathology (90th percentile), cognitive decline was about 40% slower with the 90th percentile BDNF expression vs 10th. CONCLUSIONS: Higher brain BDNF expression is associated with slower cognitive decline and may also reduce the deleterious effects of AD pathology on cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "We screened anti-Abeta1-42 antibodies from a human Alzheimer's disease (AD) specific single chain variable fragment (scFv) phage display library and assessed their effects in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Reverse transcription-PCR was used to construct the scFv phage display library, and screening identified 11A5 as an anti-Abeta1-42 antibody. We mixed 11A5 and the monoclonal antibody 6E10 with Abeta1-42 and administered the mixture to Sprague-Dawley rats via intracerebroventricular injection. After 30 days, rats injected with the antibody/Abeta1-42 mixture and those injected with Abeta1-42 alone were tested on the Morris water maze. We also injected 11A5 and 6E10 into APP/PS1 transgenic mice and assessed the concentrations of Abeta in brain and peripheral blood by ELISA at 1-month intervals for 3 months. Finally we evaluated behavior changes in the Morris water maze. Rats injected with Abeta1-42 and mixed antibodies showed better performance in the Morris water maze than did rats injected with Abeta1-42 alone. In APP/PS1 transgenic mice, Abeta concentration was lower in the brains of the antibody-treated group than in the control group, but higher in the peripheral blood. The antibody-treated mice also exhibited improved behavioral performance in the Morris water maze. In conclusion, anti-Abeta1-42 antibodies (11A5) screened from the human scFv antibody phage display library promoted the efflux or clearance of Abeta1-42 and effectively decreased the cerebral Abeta burden in an AD mouse model.",

    "title": "Axonal transport and secretion of fibrillar forms of alpha-synuclein, Abeta42 peptide and HTTExon 1.",
    "abstract": "Accruing evidence suggests that prion-like behavior of fibrillar forms of alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid peptide and mutant huntingtin are responsible for the spread of the lesions that characterize Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease and Huntington disease, respectively. It is unknown whether these distinct protein assemblies are transported within and between neurons by similar or distinct mechanisms. It is also unclear if neuronal death or injury is required for neuron-to-neuron transfer. To address these questions, we used mouse primary cortical neurons grown in microfluidic devices to measure the amounts of alpha-synuclein, Abeta42 and HTTExon1 fibrils transported by axons in both directions (anterograde and retrograde), as well as to examine the mechanism of their release from axons after anterograde transport. We observed that the three fibrils were transported in both anterograde and retrograde directions but with strikingly different efficiencies. The amount of Abeta42 fibrils transported was ten times higher than that of the other two fibrils. HTTExon1 was efficiently transported in the retrograde direction but only marginally in the anterograde direction. Finally, using neurons from two distinct mutant mouse strains whose axons are highly resistant to neurodegeneration (Wld(S) and Sarm1(-/-)), we found that the three different fibrils were secreted by axons after anterograde transport, in the absence of axonal lysis, indicating that trans-neuronal spread can occur in intact healthy neurons. In summary, fibrils of alpha-synuclein, Abeta42 and HTTExon1 are all transported in axons but in directions and amounts that are specific of each fibril. After anterograde transport, the three fibrils were secreted in the medium in the absence of axon lysis. Continuous secretion could play an important role in the spread of pathology between neurons but may be amenable to pharmacological intervention.",

In the present study, we transplanted human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into the lateral ventricle of a triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD) at the age of eight months. We evaluated spatial reference and working memory after MSC treatment and the possible underlying mechanisms, such as the influence of transplanted MSCs on neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the expression levels of a 56 kDa oligomer of amyloid beta (Abeta*56), glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate transporters (Glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) and Glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1)) in the entorhinal and prefrontal cortices and the hippocampus. At 14 months of age we observed the preservation of working memory in MSC-treated 3xTg-AD mice, suggesting that such preservation might be due to the protective effect of MSCs on GS levels and the considerable downregulation of Abeta*56 levels in the entorhinal cortex. These changes were observed six months after transplantation, accompanied by clusters of proliferating cells in the SVZ. Since the grafted cells did not survive for the whole experimental period, it is likely that the observed effects could have been transiently more pronounced at earlier time points than at six months after cell application.",

    "abstract": "The deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers in brain parenchyma has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Here we present a systems pharmacology model describing the changes in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) pathway after administration of three different doses (10, 30, and 125 mg/kg) of the beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) inhibitor MBi-5 in cisterna magna ported rhesus monkeys. The time course of the MBi-5 concentration in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was analyzed in conjunction with the effect on the concentrations of the APP metabolites Abeta42, Abeta40, soluble beta-amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) alpha, and sAPPbeta in CSF. The systems pharmacology model contained expressions to describe the production, elimination, and brain-to-CSF transport for the APP metabolites. Upon administration of MBi-5, a dose-dependent increase of the metabolite sAPPalpha and dose-dependent decreases of sAPPbeta and Abeta were observed. Maximal inhibition of BACE1 was close to 100% and the IC50 value was 0.0256 muM (95% confidence interval, 0.0137-0.0375). A differential effect of BACE1 inhibition on Abeta40 and Abeta42 was observed, with the Abeta40 response being larger than the Abeta42 response. This enabled the identification of an Abeta42 oligomer pool in the systems pharmacology model. These findings indicate that decreases in monomeric Abeta responses resulting from BACE1 inhibition are partially compensated by dissociation of Abeta oligomers and suggest that BACE1 inhibition may also reduce the putatively neurotoxic oligomer pool.",

Summary values may have clinical utility but are an average over many regions of interest, potentially obscuring important topography. This study investigates the longitudinal evolution of amyloid topographies in cognitively normal older adults who had normal (N = 131) or abnormal (N = 26) PiB scans at baseline. At 3 years follow-up, 16 participants with a previously normal PiB scan had conversion to PiB scans consistent with preclinical AD. We investigated the multivariate relationship (canonical correlation) between baseline and follow-up PiB topographies. Furthermore, we used penalized regression to investigate the added information derived from PiB topography compared to summary measures. PiB accumulation can be local, that is, a topography predicting the same topography in the future, and/or distributed, that is, one topography predicting another. Both local and distributed PiB accumulation was associated with conversion of PiB status. Additionally, elements of the multivariate topography, and not the commonly used summary scalar, correlated with future PiB changes. Consideration of the entire multivariate PiB topography provides additional information regarding the development of amyloid-beta pathology in very early preclinical AD.",

    "abstract": "The misfolding of the Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide into beta-sheet enriched conformations was proposed as an early event in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Here, the Abeta peptide secondary structure distribution in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood plasma of 141 patients was measured with an immuno-infrared-sensor. The sensor detected the amide I band, which reflects the overall secondary structure distribution of all Abeta peptides extracted from the body fluid. We observed a significant downshift of the amide I band frequency of Abeta peptides in Dementia Alzheimer type (DAT) patients, which indicated an overall shift to beta-sheet. The secondary structure distribution of all Abeta peptides provides a better marker for DAT detection than a single Abeta misfold or the concentration of a specific oligomer. The discrimination between DAT and disease control patients according to the amide I frequency was in excellent agreement with the clinical diagnosis (accuracy 90% for CSF and 84% for blood). The amide I band maximum above or below the decisive marker frequency appears as a novel spectral biomarker candidate of AD. Additionally, a preliminary proof-of-concept study indicated an amide I band shift below the marker band already in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD. The presented immuno-IR-sensor method represents a promising, simple, robust, and label-free diagnostic tool for CSF and blood analysis.",

    "abstract": "Extensive loss of hippocampal neurons serves a pathological basis for irreversible cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, this characteristic cannot be replicated by transgenic mouse models, and its underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we present evidence that different expression patterns of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) secretases in human and mouse hippocampal neurons are a decisive cause of species difference in the susceptibility to Abeta pathogenesis. Cell bodies of both pyramidal and granular neurons did not appear to undergo Abeta deposits in the 10-month-old transgenic mutant human AbetaPP/presenilin-1 (PS1) mice. They expressed high levels of non-amyloidogenic alpha-secretase, and its neuroprotective products soluble AbetaPPalpha, but low levels of amyloidogenic beta-secretase and gamma-secretase, and a neurotoxic product, Abeta42 peptide. Unlike those found in the mouse, human hippocampal neuronal cell bodies expressed beta-secretase and gamma-secretase, but not alpha-secretase, which could increase Abeta generation, thus undergoing death in response to various pathological conditions. Increased hippocampal neuronal apoptosis at 48 h following local microinjection of alpha-secretase antibody ADAM10 into the hippocampus of AbetaPP/PS1 mice further suggests that high alpha-secretase expression in mouse neuronal cell bodies is a factor in the paucity of neuronal loss in AD-like pathology. Therefore, selective down-regulation of brain alpha-secretase in transgenic AD models will better replicate the disease spectrum, including decreased brain soluble AbetaPPalpha levels and massive neuronal loss in AD patients, and be beneficial for preclinical therapeutic evaluation of AD.",

    "abstract": "Latrepirdine (Dimebon) has been demonstrated to be a neuroprotective and cognition improving agent in neurodegenerative diseases that feature protein aggregation and deposition, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein aggregates is a key event in the neurodegenerative process in AD. This study explores if latrepirdine modulation of protein aggregation contributes to its neuroprotective mechanism of action. Assessment of neuronal cell death showed that there was a significant reduction in lactate dehydrogenase release at an equimolar ratio of Abeta:latrepirdine and with lower concentrations of latrepirdine. The ability of latrepirdine to alter the formation of Abeta42 aggregates was assessed by thioflavin-T fluorescence, western immunoblotting and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Despite showing a reduction in thioflavin-T fluorescence with latrepirdine treatment, indicating a decrease in aggregation, immunoblotting and AFM showed a modest increase in both the formation and size of Abeta aggregates. The discrepancies between thioflavin-T and the other assays are consistent with previous evidence that cyclic molecules can interfere with thioflavin-T binding of amyloid protein preparations. The ability of latrepirdine to modulate Abeta aggregation appears to be independent of its neuroprotective effects, and is unlikely to be a mechanism by which latrepirdine offers protection. This study investigates the effect of latrepirdine on Abeta aggregation, and presents evidence suggesting that caution should be applied in the use of thioflavin-T fluorescence based assays as a method for screening compounds for protein aggregation altering properties.",

Treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with Abeta1-40 (10 muM, 1 h) induced a significant increase of dendritic and synaptic GluN2B puncta densities with parallel decreases in the puncta densities of denritic and synaptic pTyr1472-GluN2B. Conversely, Abeta significantly decreased dendritic and synaptic GluN2A and dendritic pTyr1325-GluN2A puncta densities and increased synaptic pTyr1325-GluN2A puncta densities. Unexpectedly, Abeta treatment resulted in a significant reduction of GluN2B and pTyr1472-GluN2B protein levels but did not influence GluN2A and pTyr1325-GluN2A levels. These results show that Abeta exerts complex and distinct regulatory effects on the trafficking and phosphorylation of GluN2A and GluN2B, as well as on their localization within synaptic and non-synaptic sites. Increased understanding of these early events in Abeta-induced synaptic dysfunction is likely to be important for the development of timely preventive and therapeutic interventions.",

    "title": "Plasma Phospholipid and Sphingolipid Alterations in Presenilin1 Mutation Carriers: A Pilot Study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Aberrant lipid metabolism has been implicated in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current study investigated plasma phospholipid and sphingolipid profiles in individuals carrying PSEN1 mutations responsible for autosomal dominant AD (ADAD). METHODS: Study participants evaluated were from the Perth and Melbourne sites of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) study. Plasma phospholipid and sphingolipid profiles were measured using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry in 20 PSEN1 mutation carriers (MC; eight of whom were symptomatic and twelve asymptomatic, based on Clinical Dementia Rating scores) and compared with six non carriers (NC) using linear mixed models. Further, AD gold standard biomarker data obtained from the DIAN database were correlated with lipid species significantly altered between MC and NC, using Spearman's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: One-hundred and thirty-nine plasma phospholipid and sphingolipid species were measured. Significantly altered species in MC compared to NC primarily belonged to choline and ethanolamine containing phospholipid classes and ceramides. Further phosphatidylcholine species (34:6, 36:5, 40:6) correlated with cerebrospinal fluid tau (p <  0.05), and plasmalogen ethanolamine species (34:2, 36:,4) correlated with both cerebrospinal fluid tau and brain amyloid load within the MC group (p <  0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate altered phospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism in ADAD and provide insight into the pathomolecular changes occurring with ADAD pathogenesis. Further, findings reported in this study allow comparison of lipid alterations in ADAD with those reported previously in sporadic AD. The findings observed in the current pilot study warrant validation in the larger DIAN cohort.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of synaptic communication in cortical and hippocampal networks has been suggested as one of the neuropathological hallmarks of the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Also, several lines of evidence have linked disrupted levels of activity-regulated cytoskeletal associated protein (Arc), an immediate early gene product that plays a central role in synaptic plasticity, with AD \"synaptopathy\". The mapping of Arc expression patterns in brain networks has been extensively used as a marker of memory-relevant neuronal activity history. Here we evaluated basal and behavior-induced Arc expression in hippocampal networks of the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD. The basal percentage of Arc-expressing cells in 10-month-old 3xTg-AD mice was higher than wild type in CA3 (4.88% versus 1.77% , respectively) but similar in CA1 (1.75% versus 2.75% ). Noteworthy, this difference was not observed at 3 months of age. Furthermore, although a Morris water maze test probe induced a steep (~4-fold) increment in the percentage of Arc+ cells in the CA3 region of the 10-month-old wild-type group, no such increment was observed in age-matched 3xTg-AD, whereas the amount of Arc+ cells in CA1 increased in both groups. Further, we detected that CA3 neurons with amyloid-beta were much more likely to express Arc protein under basal conditions. We propose that in 3xTg-AD mice, intraneuronal amyloid-beta expression in CA3 could increase unspecific neuronal activation and subsequent Arc protein expression, which might impair further memory-stabilizing processes.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is now representing one of the largest global healthcare challenges. However, an effective therapy is still lacking. Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain is supposed to trigger pathogenic cascades that eventually lead to AD. Therefore, Abeta clearance strategy is being actively pursued as a promising disease modifying therapy. Here, we found that alpha-mangostin (alpha-M), a polyphenolic xanthone derivative from mangosteen, up-regulated low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expression in microglia and liver cells, and efficiently facilitated Abeta clearance. However, the in vivo application of alpha-M is limited due to its hydrophobic nature, poor aqueous solubility and stability, and thus low bioavailability and accumulation in the target organs. To overcome this limitation, alpha-M was encapsulated into the core of poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(l-lactide) (PEG-PLA) nanoparticles [NP(alpha-M)]. Such nanoencapsulation improved the biodistribution of alpha-M in both the brain and liver, enhanced the brain clearance of (125)I-radiolabeled Abeta1-42 in an LDLR-dependent manner, reduced Abeta deposition, attenuated neuroinflammatory responses, ameliorated neurologic changes and reversed behavioral deficits in AD model mice. These findings justified the concept that polyphenol-mediated modulation of LDLR expression might serve as a safe and efficient disease-modifying therapy for AD by accelerating Abeta clearance. It also demonstrated the powerful capacity of nanotechnology in modulating the biodistribution behavior of drug to improve its therapeutic efficacy in AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein deposition in the brain. Posttranslational modifications in Abeta play an important role in Abeta deposition. Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) is an enzyme involved in posttranslational cross-linking of proteins. tTG levels and activity are increased in AD brains, and tTG is associated with Abeta deposits and lesion-associated astrocytes in AD cases. Furthermore, Abeta is a substrate of tTG-catalysed cross-linking. To study the role of tTG in Abeta pathology, we compared tTG distribution and activity in both the APPSWE/PS1DeltaE9 and APP23 mice models with human AD. Using immunohistochemistry, we found association of both tTG and in situ active tTG with Abeta plaques and vascular Abeta, in early and late stages of Abeta deposition. In addition, tTG staining colocalised with Abeta-associated reactive astrocytes. Thus, alike human AD cases, tTG was associated with Abeta depositions in these AD models. Although, distribution pattern and spatial overlay of both tTG and its activity with Abeta pathology was substantially different from human AD cases, our findings provide evidence for an early role of tTG in Abeta pathology. Yet, species differences should be taken into account when using these models to study the role of tTG in Abeta pathology.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), the main component of senile plaques in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, is generated from sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretase. Hyperglycemia in diabetes may compromise barrier integrity in endothelial cells (ECs). However, the roles of endothelial APP in response to high glucose (HG) remain to be delineated. The aims of this study were to test whether HG may increase Abeta secretion, thereby leading to heightened paracellular permeability in ECs. METHODS: We determined the effects of HG on production of Abeta, expression of full-length APP, intercellular permeability, and expression levels of specific junctional proteins in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). RESULTS: HG at 30 mM significantly stimulated expression of full-length APP accompanied by heightened secretion of Abeta1-42, increased paracellular permeability, and attenuated expression of zona occluden-1 (ZO-1), claudin-5, occludin, and junctional adhesion molecule (JAM)-C in HUVECs; all of which were abolished by the gamma-secretase inhibitor BMS299897. Exogenous application of Abeta1-42, but not the reverse peptide Abeta42-1, was sufficient to downregulate the expression of the same junction proteins. CONCLUSION: Hyperglycemia enhances APP expression with increased Abeta production, which downregulates junctional proteins causing increased intercellular permeability in ECs.",

    "title": "Amyloid Plaque in the Human Brain Can Decompose from Abeta(1-40/1-42) by Spontaneous Nonenzymatic Processes.",
    "abstract": "The degradation of long-lived proteins in the body is an important aspect of aging, and much of the breakdown is due to the intrinsic instability of particular amino acids. In this study, peptides were examined to discover if spontaneous nonenzymatic reactions could be responsible for the composition of Alzheimer's (AD) plaque in the human brain. The great majority of AD plaque consists of N-terminally truncated versions of Abeta(1-40/1-42), with the most abundant peptide commencing with Glu (residue 3 in Abeta1-40/1-42) that is present as pyroGlu. Several Asp residues are racemized in Abeta plaque, with residue 1 being predominantly l-isoAsp and peptide bond cleavage next to Ser 8 is also evident. In peptides, loss of the two N-terminal amino acids as a diketopiperazine was demonstrated at pH 7. For the Abeta N-terminal hexapeptide, AspAlaGluPheArgHis, this resulted in the removal of AspAla diketopiperazine and the generation of Glu as the new N-terminal residue. The Glu cyclized readily to pyroGlu. This pathway was altered significantly by zinc, which promoted pyroGlu formation but decreased AspAla diketopiperazine release. Zinc also facilitated cleavage on the N-terminal side of Ser 8. Racemization of the original N-terminal Asp to l-isoAsp was also detected and loss of one amino acid from the N-terminus. These data are therefore entirely consistent with plaque in the human brain forming from deposition of Abeta(1-40/1-42) and, over time, decomposing spontaneously. Since amyloid plaque is present in the human brain for years prior to the onset of AD, gradual spontaneous changes to the polypeptides within it will alter its properties and those of the oligomers that can diffuse from it. Such incremental changes in composition may therefore contribute to the origin of AD-associated cytotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "To set up a retinal degenerative model in rat that mimics pathologic conditions such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers, and assess the effect of TGF-beta1. Sprague-Dawley male rats were used. Human Abeta1-42 oligomers were intravitreally (ITV) injected (10microM) in the presence or in the absence of recombinant human TGF-beta1 (1ng/mul ITV injected). After 48h, the animals were sacrificed and the eyes removed and dissected. The apoptotic markers Bax and Bcl-2 were assessed by western blot analysis in retina lysates. Gene-pathway network analysis was carried out in order to identify pathways involved in AMD. Treatment with Abeta oligomers induced a strong increase in Bax protein level (about 4-fold; p<0.01) and a significant reduction in Bcl-2 protein level (about 2-fold; p<0.05). Co-injection of TGF-beta1 triggered a significant reduction of Bax protein induced by Abeta oligomers. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that Bcl-2 and PI3K-Akt are the most connected nodes, for genes and pathways respectively, in the enriched gene-pathway network common to AMD and Alzheimer disease (AD). Overall, these data indicate that ITV injection of Abeta1-42 oligomers in rat induces molecular changes associated with apoptosis in rat retina, highlighting a potential pathogenetic role of Abeta oligomers in AMD. Bioinformatics analysis confirms that apoptosis pathways can take part in AMD. Furthermore, these findings suggest that human recombinant TGF-beta1 can prevent retinal damage elicited by Abeta oligomers.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of [(89)Zr]JRF/AbetaN/25, a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody directed against amyloid-beta (Abeta). PROCEDURES: JRF/AbetaN/25 was labeled with (89)Zr following modification with desferal. The affinity of the tracer for Abeta1-40 was determined in a saturation binding assay. In vitro stability was evaluated, and in vivo plasma stability and biodistribution of [(89)Zr]Df-Bz-JRF/AbetaN/25 were determined in wild-type mice. To evaluate whether the antibody can cross the blood-brain barrier, brain uptake in wild-type mice was additionally assessed by ex vivo autoradiography. RESULTS: [(89)Zr]Df-Bz-JRF/AbetaN/25 was obtained in an average radiochemical yield of 50 % and a radiochemical purity of >97 %. A saturation binding assay demonstrated specific binding of [(89)Zr]Df-Bz-JRF/AbetaN/25 to Abeta1-40 with nanomolar affinity. The tracer was stable in buffer and proved to be stable in vivo with >92 % intact monoclonal antibody (mAb) remaining in the plasma at 48 h post injection. A biodistribution study showed a slow blood clearance with no significant accumulation of activity in any of the organs. Furthermore, [(89)Zr]Df-Bz-JRF/AbetaN/25 demonstrated modest brain penetration, which slowly decreased in time. This cerebral uptake was confirmed by ex vivo autoradiography. CONCLUSIONS: [(89)Zr]Df-Bz-JRF/AbetaN/25 binds with high affinity to Abeta1-40. The tracer displays an acceptable in vivo stability and is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. [(89)Zr]Df-Bz-JRF/AbetaN/25 might therefore be a potential candidate for in vivo imaging of Abeta deposition in the brain.",

    "title": "Atorvastatin in improvement of cognitive impairments caused by amyloid beta in mice: involvement of inflammatory reaction.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The production of inflammatory cytokines resulting from amyloid beta (Abeta) is associated with the initiation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Atorvastatin (ATV) has been reported to improve AD, however, it is unclear how the anti-inflammatory mechanism is linked with its protection against the impairment of spatial cognitive function in AD. The present study was designed to explore what mechanism was possibly involved in the anti-inflammatory pathway in regard to the ATV treatment of AD. METHODS: We used an AD model induced by the administration of Abeta(25-35) in male C57BL/6 mice and an in vitro culture system to study the protective effects of ATV on the spatial cognitive deficits, hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) impairment and inflammatory reaction. RESULTS: The intragastric administration of ATV (5 mg/kg) in Abeta(25-35)-treated mice significantly ameliorated the spatial cognitive deficits and prevented the LTP impairment in hippocampal CA1. The increased Iba-1 positive cells and inflammatory components in the hippocampus were reduced after the ATV treatment. The anti-inflammatory and LTP protection of ATV were abolished using the replenishment of farnesyl pyrophosphate by the administration of farnesol (FOH). The hippocampal slices culture showed Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity in the absence of the presence of ATV. Treatment with ATV (0.5, 1, 2.5 mumol/L) dose-dependently prevented the cell damage in hippocampus induced by Abeta25-35. CONCLUSION: The administration of ATV ameliorated the cognitive deficits, depressed the inflammatory responses, improved the LTP impairment, and prevents Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity in cultured hippocampal neurons. These protective functions of ATV involved the pathway of reducing farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP).",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a progressive loss of memory and other cognitive disturbances. The neuropathology of AD includes the major hallmarks of toxic amyloid-beta oligomer accumulation and neurofibrillary tangles, as well as increased oxidative stress, cholinergic dysfunction, synapse loss, changes in endogenous neurotrophic factors, and overall degeneration of the brain. Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) offer the potential for a readily available treatment that would be long lasting, have low likelihood of rejection, and could target a variety of pathological deficits. MSCs have been shown to be effective in alleviating symptoms in some transgenic models of AD, but the optimal location for transplanting MSCs has yet to be determined. In the present study, the behavioral effects of transplantation of MSCs into the lateral ventricles, the hippocampus, or both of these regions were compared in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. The results indicate that MSC transplants effectively reduce learning deficits in the 5xFAD mouse model and demonstrate a clear impact of MSCs on the levels of Abeta42 in the brains of 5xFAD mice. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that MSCs may be a viable treatment for AD, especially when injected into the lateral ventricles.",

    "abstract": "Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is now an attractive drug target for controlling neuroinflammation. Studies applying TSPO ligands to neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD), were rare. Our study was aimed to evaluate the effect of PK11195, a specific TSPO ligand, in an animal model of neuroinflammation caused by systemic LPS administration. C57/BL6 mice were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 500 mug/kg, i.p.) three days after PK11195 administration (3mg/kg, i.p.). The drugs were not discontinued until the mice were sacrificed. Cognitive function was assessed by Morris water maze (MWM) seven days after LPS injection. Chronic LPS-injection in mice was characterized by cognitive dysfunction, increased expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and TSPO, elevated Abeta content with increased expression of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) as well as decreased brain progesterone and brain-derived neurophic factor (BDNF) level. PK11195 pretreatment protected cognitive function in LPS-injected animals and normalized the inflammatory proteins. Moreover, PK11195 pre-administration decreased elevated hippocampal Abetax-42 levels and increased brain levels of progesterone, allopregnanolone. However, LPS-induced BDNF decrease was not reversed by PK11195 administration. Our data demonstrated that PK11195 could protect cognitive deficits induced by chronic LPS administration. The underling mechanism may involve alleviated neuroinflammation, increased synthesis of neurosteroid and decreased Abeta accumulation accompanied by down-regulation of BACE-1.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the utility of subjective memory decline (SMD) to predict episodic memory change and rates of clinical progression in cognitively normal older adults with evidence of high beta-amyloid burden (CN Abeta+). METHODS: Fifty-eight CN Abeta+ participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle study responded to an SMD questionnaire and underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessments. Participant data for three follow-up assessments were analyzed. RESULTS: In CN Abeta+, subjects with high SMD did not exhibit significantly greater episodic memory decline than those with low SMD. High SMD was related to greater rates of progression to mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia (hazard ratio = 5.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-20.0, P = .02) compared with low SMD. High SMD was associated with greater depressive symptomatology and smaller left hippocampal volume. DISCUSSION: High SMD is a harbinger of greater rates of clinical progression in preclinical AD. Although SMD reflects broader diagnostic implications for CN Abeta+, more sensitive measures may be required to detect early subtle cognitive change.",

    "title": "The dynamic mechanism of presenilin-1 function: Sensitive gate dynamics and loop unplugging control protein access.",
    "abstract": "There is no molecular explanation for the many presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutations causing Alzheimer's disease, but both gain of function relating to amyloid production and loss of isolated PSEN1 function have been implied. We report here the first detailed dynamic all-atom model of mature PSEN1 from molecular dynamics in an explicit membrane with particular account of the as yet unexplored loop dynamics. We find that mature PSEN1 contains multiple distinct conformational states whereas non-mature PSEN1 is a typical one-state protein. We confirm a previously suggested gating mechanism, and find that the 106-131 loop acts as a \"hinge\" for the TM2 and TM6 \"doors\". More importantly, we identify an unplugging mechanism of the Exon 9 loop associated only with mature PSEN1. Proper opening of both the \"gate\" and \"plug\" in the membrane produces channel-like morphologies and access to the catalytic aspartates. Dynamically, these features seem linked. The long-range sensitivity of this gate-plug system to subtle conformational changes can explain why so many PSEN1 mutants cause disease. Reduced access and imprecise substrate cleavage associated with impaired gate-plug dynamics is directly illustrated by the effect of maturation in our work and could explain the overall reduction in Abeta levels upon PSEN1 mutation and the increase in the Abeta 42/40 ratio. Yet, our PSEN1-only dynamics are particularly insightful in revealing PSEN1-only dynamics relating to e.g. its role as membrane channel. Thus, our identified gate-plug mechanism is relevant for designing PSEN1 modulating therapies for treatment of Alzheimer's disease within both the amyloid/gamma-secretase hypothesis and within the PSEN1 loss of function paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Flavonoids have been shown to be effective in protecting against age-related cognitive and motor decline in both in vitro and in vivo models. Recently, a flavonoid-rich extract of Citrus bergamia juice (BJe) has been shown to display anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties against LPS-induced activation of human THP-1 monocytes. In the light of these observations, we wondered whether BJe may be beneficial against neuroinflammatory processes, such as those observed in Alzheimer's disease. To this aim we used THP-1 monocytes to investigate the mechanisms underlying the beneficial potential of BJe against amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) -mediated inflammation. Exposure of THP-1 cells to Abeta1-42 significantly induced the expression and secretion of IL-6 and IL-1beta in THP-1 cells and increased the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 as well as p46 and p54 members of JNK family. Moreover, Abeta1-42 raises AP-1 DNA binding activity in THP-1-treated cells. Interestingly, all these effects were reduced in the presence of BJe. Our data indicate that BJe may effectively counteract the pro-inflammatory activation of monocytes/microglial cells exposed to amyloid fibrils, suggesting a promising role as a natural drug against neuroinflammatory processes.",

    "abstract": "Small vessel disease (SVD) and amyloid deposition may promote each other, with a potential association between SVD and altered production or clearance of beta-amyloid (Abeta) affecting its cleavage products. We investigated the relationship between SVD, multiple isoforms of Abeta in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cortical Abeta in 831 subjects with cognitive performance ranging from normal to Alzheimer's disease (AD) (the Swedish BioFINDER study). SVD was estimated as white matter lesions (WML) and lacunes. 18F-flutemetamol PET was performed in 321 subjects. Lower CSF levels of Abeta38 and Abeta40 were consistently associated with increased WML in all subgroups, while lower levels of CSF Abeta42 were associated with WML mainly in AD. CSF Abeta38 and Abeta40 were associated with regional WML in all regions, while CSF Abeta42 was associated with temporal WML only. A composite measure of 18F-flutemetamol uptake was not associated with WML, and regional 18F-flutemetamol uptake only with temporal WML. Lacunes were not associated with Abeta isoforms nor 18F-flutemetamol uptake. Our results suggest that WML may be associated with alterations in the production or clearance of Abeta species, particularly of Abeta38 and Abeta40. However, in AD cases, Abeta42 pathology might be associated with WML, especially in the temporal lobe.",

    "abstract": "Phosphoinositides are important components of eukaryotic membranes that are required for multiple forms of membrane dynamics. Phosphoinositides are involved in defining membrane identity, mediate cell signalling and control membrane trafficking events. Due to their pivotal role in membrane dynamics, phosphoinositide de-regulation contributes to various human diseases. In this review, we will focus on the newly emerging regulation of the PIKfyve complex, a phosphoinositide kinase that converts the endosomal phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate [PI(3)P] to phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate [PI(3,5)P2)], a low abundance phosphoinositide of outstanding importance for neuronal integrity and function. Loss of PIKfyve function is well known to result in neurodegeneration in both mouse models and human patients. Our recent work has surprisingly identified the amyloid precursor protein (APP), the central molecule in Alzheimer's disease aetiology, as a novel interaction partner of a subunit of the PIKfyve complex, Vac14. Furthermore, it has been shown that APP modulates PIKfyve function and PI(3,5)P2 dynamics, suggesting that the APP gene family functions as regulator of PI(3,5)P2 metabolism. The recent advances discussed in this review suggest a novel, unexpected, beta-amyloid-independent mechanism for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Incidence of Dementia over Three Decades in the Framingham Heart Study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dementia is expected to soar as the average life expectancy increases, but recent estimates suggest that the age-specific incidence of dementia is declining in high-income countries. Temporal trends are best derived through continuous monitoring of a population over a long period with the use of consistent diagnostic criteria. We describe temporal trends in the incidence of dementia over three decades among participants in the Framingham Heart Study. METHODS: Participants in the Framingham Heart Study have been under surveillance for incident dementia since 1975. In this analysis, which included 5205 persons 60 years of age or older, we used Cox proportional-hazards models adjusted for age and sex to determine the 5-year incidence of dementia during each of four epochs. We also explored the interactions between epoch and age, sex, apolipoprotein E epsilon4 status, and educational level, and we examined the effects of these interactions, as well as the effects of vascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease, on temporal trends. RESULTS: The 5-year age- and sex-adjusted cumulative hazard rates for dementia were 3.6 per 100 persons during the first epoch (late 1970s and early 1980s), 2.8 per 100 persons during the second epoch (late 1980s and early 1990s), 2.2 per 100 persons during the third epoch (late 1990s and early 2000s), and 2.0 per 100 persons during the fourth epoch (late 2000s and early 2010s). Relative to the incidence during the first epoch, the incidence declined by 22%, 38%, and 44% during the second, third, and fourth epochs, respectively. This risk reduction was observed only among persons who had at least a high school diploma (hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.88). The prevalence of most vascular risk factors (except obesity and diabetes) and the risk of dementia associated with stroke, atrial fibrillation, or heart failure have decreased over time, but none of these trends completely explain the decrease in the incidence of dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Among participants in the Framingham Heart Study, the incidence of dementia has declined over the course of three decades. The factors contributing to this decline have not been completely identified. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.).",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta deposition is thought to be associated with memory deficits, neuroinflammation, apoptotic responses, and progressive neuronal death manifested in Alzheimer's disease. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) is a transcription factor with potent anti-inflammatory effect. In the current study, the effect of GW0742, a selective PPARdelta agonist, on Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity was investigated in the hippocampus of mice. Intra-hippocampal infusion of aggregated Abeta1-42 oligomer (410pmol/mouse) remarkably damaged learning and memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests, accompanied by decreased expression of PPARdelta in the hippocampus as confirmed by Western blot. Intra-hippocampal infusion of GW0742 (1.06 mM/mouse) significantly improved Abeta1-42-induced memory deficits in mice, reversed Abeta1-42-induced hippocampal PPARdelta down-regulation and repressed Abeta1-42-triggered neuroinflammatory and apoptotic responses, indicated by decreased nuclear NF-kappaB p65, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta as well as a decrease in cleaved caspase-3 and increased ratio of Bcl-2/Bax in the hippocampus. These results suggest that PPARdelta activation ameliorates Abeta1-42-induced hippocampal neurotoxicity, and it might play a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Tackling amyloidogenesis in Alzheimer's disease with A2V variants of Amyloid-beta.",
    "abstract": "We developed a novel therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) exploiting the properties of a natural variant of Amyloid-beta (Abeta) carrying the A2V substitution, which protects heterozygous carriers from AD by its ability to interact with wild-type Abeta, hindering conformational changes and assembly thereof. As prototypic compound we designed a six-mer mutated peptide (Abeta1-6A2V), linked to the HIV-related TAT protein, which is widely used for brain delivery and cell membrane penetration of drugs. The resulting molecule [Abeta1-6A2VTAT(D)] revealed strong anti-amyloidogenic effects in vitro and protected human neuroblastoma cells from Abeta toxicity. Preclinical studies in AD mouse models showed that short-term treatment with Abeta1-6A2VTAT(D) inhibits Abeta aggregation and cerebral amyloid deposition, but a long treatment schedule unexpectedly increases amyloid burden, although preventing cognitive deterioration. Our data support the view that the AbetaA2V-based strategy can be successfully used for the development of treatments for AD, as suggested by the natural protection against the disease in human A2V heterozygous carriers. The undesirable outcome of the prolonged treatment with Abeta1-6A2VTAT(D) was likely due to the TAT intrinsic attitude to increase Abeta production, avidly bind amyloid and boost its seeding activity, warning against the use of the TAT carrier in the design of AD therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) is a multipotent triterpene saponin extracted from ginseng, and has been proven to act as a nootropic agent against various types of neurological damage. The present study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effect and the underlying mechanisms of Rg1 on apoptosis induced by beta-amyloid peptide 25-35 (Abeta25-35) in primary cultured cortical neurons. The primary neurons were preincubated with 20 microM Rg1 for 24 h and exposed to 10 microM Abeta25-35 for 72 h. In the present study, we found that Rg1 prevented nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) nuclear translocation and IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation in primary cultured cortical neurons after Abeta25-35 exposure by scavenging excess reactive oxygen species (ROS); ROS was measured using DCFDA and examined using a fluorescence microscope. In addition, Rg1 successfully suppressed Abeta25-35-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide (NO) production in a NF-kappaB-dependent manner; the suppression of NO was clearly illustrated by the NO production assay. Pretreatment of the cells with Rg1 elevated the proportion of Bcl-2/Bax, lessened the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytoplasm and then blocked mitochondrial apoptotic cascades after Abeta25-35 insult by lowering NO generation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Rg1 rescues primary cultured cortical neurons from Abeta25-35-induced cell apoptosis through the downregulation of the NF-kappaB/NO signaling pathway.",

    "title": "Abeta40 Reduces P-Glycoprotein at the Blood-Brain Barrier through the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Failure to clear amyloid-beta (Abeta) from the brain is in part responsible for Abeta brain accumulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A critical protein for clearing Abeta across the blood-brain barrier is the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the luminal plasma membrane of the brain capillary endothelium. P-gp is reduced at the blood-brain barrier in AD, which has been shown to be associated with Abeta brain accumulation. However, the mechanism responsible for P-gp reduction in AD is not well understood. Here we focused on identifying critical mechanistic steps involved in reducing P-gp in AD. We exposed isolated rat brain capillaries to 100 nm Abeta40, Abeta40, aggregated Abeta40, and Abeta42. We observed that only Abeta40 triggered reduction of P-gp protein expression and transport activity levels; this occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner. To identify the steps involved in Abeta-mediated P-gp reduction, we inhibited protein ubiquitination, protein trafficking, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and monitored P-gp protein expression, transport activity, and P-gp-ubiquitin levels. Thus, exposing brain capillaries to Abeta40 triggers ubiquitination, internalization, and proteasomal degradation of P-gp. These findings may provide potential therapeutic targets within the blood-brain barrier to limit P-gp degradation in AD and improve Abeta brain clearance. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The mechanism reducing blood-brain barrier P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood. In the present study, we focused on defining this mechanism. We demonstrate that Abeta40 drives P-gp ubiquitination, internalization, and proteasome-dependent degradation, reducing P-gp protein expression and transport activity in isolated brain capillaries. These findings may provide potential therapeutic avenues within the blood-brain barrier to limit P-gp degradation in Alzheimer's disease and improve Abeta brain clearance.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been associated with functional alterations, often in an episodic memory system with a particular emphasis on medial temporal lobe function. The topography of Abeta deposition, however, largely overlaps with frontoparietal control (FPC) regions implicated in cognitive control that has been shown to be impaired in early mild AD. To understand the neural mechanism underlying early changes in cognitive control with AD, we examined the impact of Abeta deposition on task-evoked FPC activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Forty-three young and 62 cognitively normal older adults underwent an fMRI session during an executive contextual task in which task difficulty varied: single (either letter case or vowel/consonant judgment task) vs dual (switching between letter case and vowel/consonant decisions) task. Older subjects additionally completed (18)F-florbetaben positron emission tomography scans and were classified as either amyloid positive (Abeta+) or negative (Abeta-). Consistent with previous reports, age-related increases in brain activity were found in FPC regions commonly identified across groups. For both task conditions, Abeta-related increases in brain activity were found compared with baseline activity. For higher cognitive control load, however, Abeta+ elderly showed reduced task-switching activation in the right inferior frontal cortex. Our findings suggest that with Abeta deposition, brain activation in the cognitive control region reaches a maximum with lower control demand and decreases with higher control demand, which may underlie early impairment in cognitive control with AD progression. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, spatially overlaps with frontoparietal control (FPC) regions implicated in cognitive control, but the impact of Abeta deposition on FPC regions is largely unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging with a task-switching task, we found Abeta-related increases in FPC regions compared with baseline activity. For higher cognitive control load, however, Abeta-related hypoactivity was found in the right inferior frontal cortex, a region highly implicated in cognitive control. The findings suggest that with Abeta deposition, task-related brain activity may reach a plateau early and undergo downstream pathways of neural dysfunction, which may relate to the early impairment of cognitive control seen in the progression of Abeta pathology.",

However, it has been challenging to characterize the tertiary and quaternary structures of Abeta peptides due to their disordered nature and high aggregation propensity. In this work, replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations were used to explore the conformational space of Abeta42 monomer. Among the most populated transient states, we identified a particular conformation which was able to generate ring-shaped pentamers and hexamers, when docked onto itself. The structures of these aggregates were stable during microsecond all-atom MD simulations in explicit solvent. In addition to high resolution models of these oligomers, this study provides support for the conformational selection mechanism of Abeta peptide self-assembly.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques in the AD brain. Comprised primarily of the 40- and 42-residue beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, there is evidence that the heparan sulfate (HS) of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) plays a role in amyloid plaque formation and stability; however, details of the interaction of Abeta peptides with HS are not known. We have characterized the interaction of heparin and heparin-derived oligosaccharides with a model peptide for the heparin- and HS-binding domain of Abeta peptides (Ac-VHHQKLV-NH2; Abeta(12-18)), with mutants of Abeta(12-18), and with additional histidine-containing peptides. The nature of the binding interaction was characterized by NMR, binding constants and other thermodynamic parameters were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and relative binding affinities were determined by heparin affinity chromatography. The binding of Abeta(12-18) by heparin and heparin-derived oligosaccharides is pH-dependent, with the imidazolium groups of the histidine side chains interacting site-specifically within a cleft created by a trisaccharide sequence of heparin, the binding is mediated by electrostatic interactions, and there is a significant entropic contribution to the binding free energy as a result of displacement of Na(+) ions from heparin upon binding of cationic Abeta(12-18). The binding constant decreases as the size of the heparin-derived oligosaccharide decreases and as the concentration of Na(+) ion in the bulk solution increases. Structure-binding relationships characterized in this study are analyzed and discussed in terms of the counterion condensation theory of the binding of cationic peptides by anionic polyelectrolytes.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral beta-amyloidosis, one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), elicits a well-characterised, microglia-mediated local innate immune response. In contrast, it is not clear whether cells of the adaptive immune system, in particular T-cells, react to cerebral amyloidosis in AD. Even though parenchymal T-cells have been described in post-mortem brains of AD patients, it is not known whether infiltrating T-cells are specifically recruited to the extracellular deposits of beta-amyloid, and whether they are locally activated into proliferating, effector cells upon interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs). To address these issues we have analysed by confocal microscopy and flow-cytometry the localisation and activation status of both T-cells and APCs in transgenic (tg) mice models of AD-like cerebral amyloidosis. Increased numbers of infiltrating T-cells were found in amyloid-burdened brain regions of tg mice, with concomitant up-regulation of endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, compared to non-tg littermates. The infiltrating T-cells in tg brains did not co-localise with amyloid plaques, produced less interferon-gamma than those in controls and did not proliferate locally. Bona-fide dendritic cells were virtually absent from the brain parenchyma of both non-tg and tg mice, and APCs from tg brains showed an immature phenotype, with accumulation of MHC-II in intracellular compartments. These results indicate that cerebral amyloidosis promotes T-cell infiltration but interferes with local antigen presentation and T-cell activation. The inability of the brain immune surveillance to orchestrate a protective immune response to amyloid-beta peptide might contribute to the accumulation of amyloid in the progression of the disease.",

    "abstract": "One of the major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in the brain. Abeta accumulation seems to arise from an imbalance between Abeta production and clearance. Neprilysin (NEP) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) are the important Abeta-degrading enzymes in the brain, and deficits in their expression may promote Abeta deposition in patients with sporadic late-onset AD. Statins, which are used clinically for reducing cholesterol levels, can exert beneficial effects on AD. Therefore, we examined whether various statins are associated with Abeta degradation by inducing NEP and IDE expression, and then evaluating the relation between activation of intracellular signaling transduction, inhibition of cholesterol production, and morphological changes to astrocytes. Treating cultured rat astrocytes with simvastatin and atorvastatin significantly decreased the expression of NEP but not IDE in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The decrease in NEP expression was a result of activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but not the reduction of cholesterol synthesis pathway. This NEP reduction was achieved by the release to the extracellular space of cultured astrocytes. Furthermore, the cultured medium prepared from simvastatin- and atorvastatin-treated astrocytes significantly induced the degradation of exogenous Abeta. These results suggest that simvastatin and atorvastatin induce the increase of Abeta degradation of NEP on the extracellular of astrocytes by inducing ERK-mediated pathway activity and that these reagents regulate the differential mechanisms between the secretion of NEP, the induction of cholesterol reduction, and the morphological changes in the cultured astrocytes.",

    "abstract": "beta-Amyloid (Abeta), a hallmark peptide of Alzheimer's disease, induces both caspase-dependent apoptosis and non-apoptotic cell death. In this study, we examined caspase-independent non-apoptotic cell death preceding caspase activation in Abeta42-treated cells. We first determined the optimal treatment conditions for inducing cell death without caspase activation and selected a double-treatment method involving the incubation of cells with Abeta42 for 4 and 6 h (4+6 h sample). We observed that levels of lamin A (LA) and lamin B (LB) were reduced in the 4+6 h samples. This reduction was decreased by treatment with suc-AAPF-CMK, an inhibitor of nuclear scaffold (NS) protease, but not by treatment with z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor. In addition, suc-AAPF-CMK decreased the changes in nuclear morphology observed in cells in the 4+6 h samples, which were different from nuclear fragmentation observed in STS-treated cells. Furthermore, suc-AAPF-CMK inhibited cell death in the 4+6 h samples. LA and LB fragmentation occurred in the isolated nuclei and was also inhibited by suc-AAPF-CMK. Together, these data indicated that the fragmentation of LA and LB in the Abeta42-treated cells was induced by an NS protease, whose identity is not clearly determined yet. A correlation between Abeta42 toxicity and the lamin fragmentation by NS protease suggests that inhibition of the protease could be an effective method for controlling the pathological process of AD.",

    "abstract": "Chotosan (CTS) is a traditional Kampo prescription used to treat chronic headache and hypertension. Recent clinical studies demonstrated that CTS has ameliorative effects on dementia. This study aims to identify the anti-Alzheimer components in CTS. beta-amyloid (Abeta) is considered to play a central role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. CTS-E, a fraction of CTS, showed significant protective effects on Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for the qualitative analysis of it. Among the identified constituents, neuroprotective effects against Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity of 10 major compounds were tested by MTT assay. Their inhibitory action on Abeta(1-42) self-induced aggregation was measured by Thioflavin T-binding assay. The results showed that caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, 1,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid and 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid had significant neuroprotective effects on Abeta(25-35)-induced neurotoxicity. Besides these phenolic acids, nobiletin and hesperidin could also inhibit Abeta(1-42) self-induced aggregation. In conclusion, the neuroprotective fraction, CTS-E, could protect PC12 cells from Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. Anti-oxidative effects may at least partly mediate the neuroprotective effects of it. Phenolic acids from Chrysanthemi Flos and flavonoids from Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium might be the effective constituents in CTS-E.",

However, due to the rapidness of hIAPP conversion in aqueous phase, exactly which hIAPP species is responsible for the observed toxicity and through what mechanisms remains ambiguous. In light of the importance of understanding hIAPP toxicity for T2D here we show a biophysical scheme based on the use of a lipophilic Laurdan dye for examining MIN6 cell membranes upon exposure to fresh and oligomeric hIAPP as well as mature amyloid. It has been found that all three hIAPP species, especially fresh hIAPP, enhanced membrane fluidity and caused losses in cell viability. The cell generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), however, was the most pronounced with mature amyloid hIAPP. The correlation between changes in membrane fluidity and cell viability and their lack of correlation with ROS production suggest hIAPP toxicity is elicited through both physical and biochemical means. This study offers a new insight into beta-cell toxicity induced by controlled hIAPP species, as well as new biophysical methodologies that may prove beneficial for the studies of T2D as well as neurological disorders.",

    "abstract": "The progressive loss of neurons and inflammation characterizes neurodegenerative diseases. Although the etiology, progression and outcome of different neurodegenerative diseases are varied, they share chronic inflammation maintained largely by central nervous system (CNS)-derived antigens recognized by T cells. Inflammation can be beneficial by recruiting immune cells to kill pathogens or to clear cell debris resulting from the primary insult. However, chronic inflammation exacerbates and perpetuates tissue damage. An increasing number of therapies that attempt to modulate neuroinflammation have been developed. However, so far none has succeeded in decreasing the secondary damage associated with chronic inflammation. A potential strategy to modulate the immune system is related to the induction of tolerance to CNS antigens. In this line, it is our hypothesis that this could be accomplished by using anterior chamber associated immune deviation (ACAID) as a strategy. Thus, we review current knowledge regarding some neurodegenerative diseases and the associated immune response that causes inflammation. In addition, we discuss further our hypothesis of the possible usefulness of ACAID as a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate damage to the CNS.",

The role of morphology, length, and nature of the amyloid surface on exfoliation/dispersions of MoS2 were investigated through specific mutations of the amyloid sequences. Notably, owing to the properties of both the constituents, self-assembled soft nanostructures and MoS2 , the hybrid dispersions responded reversibly to various stimuli, including temperature, pH, and light. Addition of a protease resulted in loss of the dispersions, which are otherwise stable for months at ambient conditions. The design flexibility of the peptide sequences, along with the stimuli-responsiveness and biodegradability, can complement the applications of MoS2 in diverse fields.",

    "abstract": "The epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4) is associated with cognitive decline during aging, is the greatest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and has links to other neurodegenerative conditions that affect cognition. Increasing evidence indicates that APOE genotypes differentially modulate the function of the cerebrovasculature (CV), with apoE and its receptors expressed by different cell types at the CV interface (astrocytes, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, brain endothelial cells). However, research on the role of apoE in CV dysfunction has not advanced as quickly as other apoE-modulated pathways. This review will assess what aspects of the CV are modulated by APOE genotypes during aging and under disease states, discuss potential mechanisms, and summarize the therapeutic significance of the topic. We propose that APOE4 induces CV dysfunction through direct signaling at the CV, and indirectly via modulation of peripheral and central pathways. Further, that APOE4 predisposes the CV to damage by, and exacerbates the effects of, additional risk factors (such as sex, hypertension, and diabetes). ApoE4-induced detrimental CV changes include reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF), modified neuron-CBF coupling, increased blood-brain barrier leakiness, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, hemorrhages and disrupted transport of nutrients and toxins. The apoE4-induced detrimental changes may be linked to pericyte migration/activation, astrocyte activation, smooth muscle cell damage, basement membrane degradation and alterations in brain endothelial cells.",

However, numerous clinical trials are testing vaccination strategies for AD, suggesting that T and B cells play a pivotal role in this disease. To test the hypothesis that adaptive immunity influences AD pathogenesis, we generated an immune-deficient AD mouse model that lacks T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells. The resulting \"Rag-5xfAD\" mice exhibit a greater than twofold increase in beta-amyloid (Abeta) pathology. Gene expression analysis of the brain implicates altered innate and adaptive immune pathways, including changes in cytokine/chemokine signaling and decreased Ig-mediated processes. Neuroinflammation is also greatly exacerbated in Rag-5xfAD mice as indicated by a shift in microglial phenotype, increased cytokine production, and reduced phagocytic capacity. In contrast, immune-intact 5xfAD mice exhibit elevated levels of nonamyloid reactive IgGs in association with microglia, and treatment of Rag-5xfAD mice or microglial cells with preimmune IgG enhances Abeta clearance. Last, we performed bone marrow transplantation studies in Rag-5xfAD mice, revealing that replacement of these missing adaptive immune populations can dramatically reduce AD pathology. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that adaptive immune cell populations play an important role in restraining AD pathology. In contrast, depletion of B cells and their appropriate activation by T cells leads to a loss of adaptive-innate immunity cross talk and accelerated disease progression.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is a fundamental pathogenic mechanism leading to the neuronal damage present in Alzheimer disease, and soluble Abeta oligomers are thought to be a major toxic culprit. Thus, better knowledge and specific targeting of the pathways that lead to these noxious species may result in valuable therapeutic strategies. We characterized some effects of the molecular chaperone clusterin, providing new and more detailed evidence of its potential neuroprotective effects. Using a classical thioflavin T assay, we observed a dose-dependent inhibition of the aggregation process. The global analysis of time courses under different conditions demonstrated that clusterin has no effect on the elongation rate but mainly interferes with the nucleation processes (both primary and secondary), reducing the number of nuclei available for further fibril growth. Then, using a recently developed immunoassay based on surface plasmon resonance, we obtained direct evidence of a high-affinity (KD= 1 nm) interaction of clusterin with biologically relevant Abeta1-42oligomers, selectively captured on the sensor chip. Moreover, with the same technology, we observed that substoichiometric concentrations of clusterin prevent oligomer interaction with the antibody 4G8, suggesting that the chaperone shields hydrophobic residues exposed on the oligomeric assemblies. Finally, we found that preincubation with clusterin antagonizes the toxic effects of Abeta1-42oligomers, as evaluated in a recently developedin vivomodel inCaenorhabditis elegans.These data substantiate the interaction of clusterin with biologically active regions exposed on nuclei/oligomers of Abeta1-42, providing a molecular basis for the neuroprotective effects of the chaperone.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reducing beta amyloid- (Abeta-) induced microglial activation is considered to be effective in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nicotine attenuates Abeta-induced microglial activation; the mechanism, however, is still elusive. Microglia could be activated into classic activated state (M1 state) or alternative activated state (M2 state); the former is cytotoxic and the latter is neurotrophic. In this investigation, we hypothesized that nicotine attenuates Abeta-induced microglial activation by shifting microglial M1 to M2 state, and cannabinoid CB2 receptor and protein kinase C mediate the process. METHODS: We used Abeta1-42 to activate N9 microglial cells and observed nicotine-induced effects on microglial M1 and M2 biomarkers by using western blot, immunocytochemistry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: We found that nicotine reduced the levels of M1 state markers, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin- (IL-) 6 releases; meanwhile, it increased the levels of M2 state markers, including arginase-1 (Arg-1) expression and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release, in the Abeta-stimulated microglia. Coadministration of cannabinoid CB2 receptor antagonist or protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor partially abolished the nicotine-induced effects. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that cannabinoid CB2 receptor mediates nicotine-induced anti-inflammation in microglia exposed to Abeta via PKC.",

    "abstract": "Justicidin A is a structurally defined arylnaphthalide lignan, which has been shown anti-cancer activity; however, the neuroprotective effect of justicidin A is still untested. In this study, we investigated the action of justicidin A on amyloid beta (Abeta)25-35-induced neuronal cell death via inhibition of the hyperphosphorylation of tau and induction of autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells. Pretreatment with justicidin A significantly elevated cell viability in cells treated with Abeta25-35. Western blot data demonstrated that justicidin A inhibited the Abeta25-35-induced up-regulation the levels of hyperphosphorylation of tau in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, treatment with justicidin A significantly induced autophagy as measured by the increasing LC3 II/I ratio, an important autophagy marker. These studies showed that justicidin A inhibited activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), which is an important kinase in up-stream signaling pathways; inhibited hyperphosphorylation of tau in AD; and enhanced activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is the key molecule for both hyperphosphorylation of tau and induction of autophagy. These data provide the first evidence that justicidin A protects SH-SY5Y cells from Abeta25-35-induced neuronal cell death through inhibition of hyperphosphorylation of tau and induction of autophagy via regulation the activity of GSK-3beta and AMPK, and they also provide some insights into the relationship between tau protein hyperphosphorylation and autophagy. Thus, we conclude that justicidin A may have a potential role for neuroprotection and, therefore, may be used as a therapeutic agent for AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) represents a genetically heterogeneous entity. To elucidate neuropathologic features of autosomal dominant AD ([ADAD] due to PSEN1, APP, or PSEN2 mutations), we compared hallmark AD pathologic findings in 60 cases of ADAD and 120 cases of sporadic AD matched for sex, race, ethnicity, and disease duration. Greater degrees of neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle formation and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) were found in ADAD (p values < 0.01). Moderate to severe CAA was more prevalent in ADAD (63.3% vs. 39.2%, p = 0.003), and persons with PSEN1 mutations beyond codon 200 had higher average Braak scores and severity and prevalence of CAA than those with mutations before codon 200. Lewy body pathology was less extensive in ADAD but was present in 27.1% of cases. We also describe a novel pathogenic PSEN1 mutation (P267A). The finding of more severe neurofibrillary pathology and CAA in ADAD, particularly in carriers of PSEN1 mutations beyond codon 200, warrants consideration when designing trials to treat or prevent ADAD. The finding of Lewy body pathology in a substantial minority of ADAD cases supports the assertion that development of Lewy bodies may be in part driven by abnormal beta-amyloid protein precursor processing.",

    "abstract": "The hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau is present in several neurodegenerative diseases, although the causal relationship remains elusive. Few mouse models used to study Alzheimer-like dementia target tau phosphorylation. We created an inducible pseudophosphorylated tau (Pathological Human Tau, PH-Tau) mouse model to study the effect of conformationally modified tau in vivo. Leaky expression resulted in two levels of PH-Tau: low basal level and higher upon induction (4% and 14% of the endogenous tau, respectively). Unexpectedly, low PH-Tau resulted in significant cognitive deficits, decrease in the number of synapses (seen by EM in the CA1 region), reduction of synaptic proteins, and localization to the nucleus. Induction of PH-Tau triggered neuronal death (60% in CA3), astrocytosis, and loss of the processes in CA1. These findings suggest, that phosphorylated tau is sufficient to induce neurodegeneration and that two different mechanisms can induce cognitive impairment depending on the levels of PH-Tau expression.",

    "abstract": "Deficiency of insulin signaling has been linked to diabetes and ageing-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this regard, brains exhibit defective insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and hence result in alteration of insulin signaling in progression of AD, the most common cause of dementia. Consequently, dysregulation of insulin signaling plays an important role in amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity. As the derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) involves cell reprogramming, it may provide a means for regaining the control of ageing-associated dysfunction and neurodegeneration via affecting insulin-related signaling. To this, we found that an embryonic stem cell (ESC)-specific microRNA, miR-302, silences phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) to activate Akt signaling, which subsequently stimulates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) elevation and hence inhibits Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. miR-302 is predominantly expressed in iPSCs and is known to regulate several important biological processes of anti-oxidative stress, anti-apoptosis, and anti-aging through activating Akt signaling. In addition, we also found that miR-302-mediated Akt signaling further stimulates Nanog expression to suppress Abeta-induced p-Ser307 IRS-1 expression and thus enhances tyrosine phosphorylation and p-Ser 473-Akt/p-Ser 9-GSK3beta formation. Furthermore, our in vivo studies revealed that the mRNA expression levels of both Nanog and miR-302-encoding LARP7 genes were significantly reduced in AD patients' blood cells, providing a novel diagnosis marker for AD. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that miR-302 is able to inhibit Abeta-induced cytotoxicity via activating Akt signaling to upregulate Nrf2 and Nanog expressions, leading to a marked restoration of insulin signaling in AD neurons.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of pathological, biomarker, genetic, and mechanistic data suggests that amyloid accumulation, as a result of changes in production, processing, and/or clearance of brain amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) concentrations, plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) mediates the first step in the processing of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) to Abeta peptides, with the soluble N terminal fragment of AbetaPP (sAbetaPPbeta) as a direct product, and BACE1 inhibition is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention to reduce the production of Abeta. Here, we report the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological profile of AZD3293, a potent, highly permeable, orally active, blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrating, BACE1 inhibitor with unique slow off-rate kinetics. The in vitro potency of AZD3293 was demonstrated in several cellular models, including primary cortical neurons. In vivo in mice, guinea pigs, and dogs, AZD3293 displayed significant dose- and time-dependent reductions in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain concentrations of Abeta40, Abeta42, and sAbetaPPbeta. The in vitro potency of AZD3293 in mouse and guinea pig primary cortical neuronal cells was correlated to the in vivo potency expressed as free AZD3293 concentrations in mouse and guinea pig brains. In mice and dogs, the slow off-rate from BACE1 may have translated into a prolongation of the observed effect beyond the turnover rate of Abeta. The preclinical data strongly support the clinical development of AZD3293, and patients with AD are currently being recruited into a combined Phase 2/3 study to test the disease-modifying properties of AZD3293.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with alterations in epigenetic factors leading to cognitive decline. Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) is a known critical epigenetic negative regulator of learning and memory. In this study, attenuation of long-term potentiation by amyloid-beta oligomer, and its reversal by specific HDAC3 inhibitor RGFP966, was performed in rat CA1 pyramidal neurons using whole cell voltage-clamp and field recording techniques. Our findings provide the first evidence that amyloid-beta oligomer-induced synaptic plasticity impairment can be prevented by inhibition of HDAC3 enzyme both at the single neuron as well as in a population of neurons, thus identifying HDAC3 as a potential target for ameliorating AD related plasticity impairments.",

    "title": "Differential Membrane Toxicity of Amyloid-beta Fragments by Pore Forming Mechanisms.",
    "abstract": "A major characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the presence of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) oligomers and aggregates in the brain. It is known that Abeta oligomers interact with the neuronal membrane and induce perforations that cause an influx of calcium ions and enhance the release of synaptic vesicles leading to a delayed synaptic failure by vesicle depletion. To better understand the mechanism by which Abeta exerts its effect on the plasma membrane, we evaluated three Abeta fragments derived from different regions of Abeta(1-42); Abeta(1-28) from the N-terminal region, Abeta(25-35) from the central region, and Abeta(17-42) from the C-terminal region. The neuronal activities of these fragments were examined with patch clamp, immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, aggregation assays, calcium imaging, and MTT reduction assays. The present results indicate that the fragment Abeta(1-28) contributes to aggregation, an increase in intracellular calcium and synaptotoxicity, but is not involved in membrane perforation; Abeta(25-35) is important for membrane perforation, calcium increase, and synaptotoxicity; and Abeta(17-42) induced mitochondrial toxicity similar to the full length Abeta(1-42), but was unable to induce membrane perforation and calcium increase, supporting the idea that it is less toxic in the non-amyloidogenic pathway.",

ApoE is upregulated by activation of the retinoid X receptor moiety of the RXR/PPARgamma dimeric receptor. Genistein, a non-toxic, well-tested, and inexpensive drug activates the other moiety of the receptor PPARgamma. Treatment of an Alzheimer's disease mouse model with genistein results in a remarkable and rapid improvement in various parameters of cognition, such as hippocampal learning, recognition memory, implicit memory, and odor discrimination. This is associated with a lowering of Abeta levels in brain, in the number and the area of amyloid plaques (confirmed in vivo by positron emission tomography) as well as in microglial reactivity. Finally, incubation of primary astrocytes with genistein results in a PPARgamma-mediated increased release of ApoE. Our results strongly suggest that controlled clinical trials should be performed to test the effect of genistein as treatment of human Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Brain ischemia may be causally related with Alzheimer's disease. Presumably, beta-secretase and amyloid-beta protein precursor gene expression changes may be associated with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. Consequently, we have examined quantitative changes in both beta-secretase and amyloid-beta protein precursor genes in the medial temporal lobe cortex with the use of quantitative rtPCR analysis following 10-min global brain ischemia in rats with survival of 2, 7, and 30 days. The greatest significant overexpression of beta-secretase gene was noted on the 2nd day, while on days 7-30 the expression of this gene was only modestly downregulated. Amyloid-beta protein precursor gene was downregulated on the 2nd day, but on days 7-30 postischemia, there was a significant reverse tendency. Thus, the demonstrated alterations indicate that the considerable changes of expression of beta-secretase and amyloid-beta protein precursor genes may be connected with a response of neurons in medial temporal lobe cortex to transient global brain ischemia. Finally, the ischemia-induced gene changes may play a key role in a late and slow onset of Alzheimer-type pathology.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid proteins are known to be the main cause of numerous degenerative and neurodegenerative diseases. In general, amyloids are misfolded from monomers and they tend to have beta-strand formations. These misfolded monomers are then transformed into oligomers, fibrils, and plaques. It is important to understand the forming mechanism of amyloids in order to prevent degenerative diseases to occur. Abeta protein is a highly noticeable protein which causes Alzheimer's disease. It is reported that solvents affect the forming mechanism of Abeta amyloids. In this research, Abeta1-42 was analyzed using an all-atom MD simulation with the consideration of effects induced by two disparate solvents: water and DMSO. As a result, two different conformation changes of Abeta1-42 were exhibited in each solvent. It was found that salt-bridge of Asp23 and Lys28 in Abeta1-42 was the key for amyloid folding based on the various analysis including hydrogen bond, electrostatic interaction energy and salt-bridge distance. Since this salt-bridge region plays a crucial role in initiating the misfolding of Abeta1-42, this research may shed a light for studies related in amyloid folding and misfolding.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) can incur significant health care costs to the patient, their families, and society; furthermore, effective treatments are limited, as the mechanisms of AD are not fully understood. This study utilized twelve adult male tree shrews (TS), which were randomly divided into PBS and amyloidbetapeptide1-40 (Abeta1-40) groups. AD model was established via an intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of Abeta1-40 after being incubated for 4 days at 37  C. Behavioral, pathophysiological and molecular changes were evaluated by hippocampal-dependent tasks, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), silver staining, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, TUNEL assay and gene sequencing, respectively. At 4 weeks post-injection, as compared with the PBS group, in Abeta1-40 injected animals: cognitive impairments happened, and the hippocampus had atrophied indicated by MRI findings; meanwhile, HE staining showed the cells of the CA3 and DG were significantly thinner and smaller. The average number of cells in the DG, but not the CA3, was also significantly reduced; furthermore, silver staining revealed neurotic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the hippocampi; TUNEL assay showed many cells exhibited apoptosis, which was associated with downregulated BCL-2/BCL-XL-associated death promoter (Bad), inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), Cytochrome c (CytC) and upregulated tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1); lastly, gene sequencing reported a total of 924 mobilized genes, among which 13 of the downregulated and 19 of the upregulated genes were common to the AD pathway. The present study not only established AD models in TS, but also reported on the underlying mechanism involved in neuronal apoptosis associated with multiple gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation and toxicity of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) are considered as critical events in the initiation and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent evidence indicated that soluble oligomeric Abeta assemblies exert pronounced toxicity, rather than larger fibrillar aggregates that deposit in the forms of extracellular plaques. While some rare mutations in the Abeta sequence that cause early-onset AD promote the oligomerization, molecular mechanisms that induce the formation or stabilization of oligomers of the wild-type Abeta remain unclear. Here, we identified an Abeta variant phosphorylated at Ser26 residue (pSer26Abeta) in transgenic mouse models of AD and in human brain that shows contrasting spatio-temporal distribution as compared to non-phosphorylated Abeta (npAbeta) or other modified Abeta species. pSer26Abeta is particularly abundant in intraneuronal deposits at very early stages of AD, but much less in extracellular plaques. pSer26Abeta assembles into a specific oligomeric form that does not proceed further into larger fibrillar aggregates, and accumulates in characteristic intracellular compartments of granulovacuolar degeneration together with TDP-43 and phosphorylated tau. Importantly, pSer26Abeta oligomers exert increased toxicity in human neurons as compared to other known Abeta species. Thus, pSer26Abeta could represent a critical species in the neurodegeneration during AD pathogenesis.",

Interactions of zinc ions with Abeta are mediated by the N-terminal Abeta(1-16) domain and appear to play a key role in AD progression. There is a range of results indicating that these interactions trigger the Abeta plaque formation. We have determined structure and functional characteristics of the metal binding domains derived from several Abeta variants and found that their zinc-induced oligomerization is governed by conformational changes in the minimal zinc binding site 6HDSGYEVHH14. The residue H6 and segment 11EVHH14, which are part of this site are crucial for formation of the two zinc-mediated interaction interfaces in Abeta. These structural determinants can be considered as promising targets for rational design of the AD-modifying drugs aimed at blocking pathological Abeta aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases the risk of neurodegenerative disorders many years post-injury. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between TBI and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), remain to be elucidated. Nevertheless, previous studies have demonstrated a link between TBI and increased amyloid-beta (Abeta), a protein involved in AD pathogenesis. Here, we review animal studies that measured Abeta levels following TBI. In addition, from a pool of initially identified 1209 published papers, we examined data from 19 eligible animal model studies using a meta-analytic approach. We found an acute increase in cerebral Abeta levels ranging from 24h to one month following TBI (overall log OR=2.97 +- 0.40, p<0.001). These findings may contribute to further understanding the relationship between TBI and future dementia risk. The methodological inconsistencies of the studies discussed in this review suggest the need for improved and more standardised data collection and study design, in order to properly elucidate the role of TBI in the expression and accumulation of Abeta.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy, the process of self-degradation of cellular components, has an important role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we investigated the effects of SP600125 as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor and bucladesine as a cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) analog on spatial memory and expression of autophagic factors in Abeta-injected rats. Male Wistar rats were used. Rats were randomly allocated into five groups as following: amyloid beta (Abeta)-only group, Abeta + SP600125 (30 mug/1 mu/side, n = 7) and/or bucladesine (100 muM/1 mul/side, n = 7), and the normal control (vehicle only) group. The treatments were administered bilaterally to the CA1 sub-region of the hippocampus stereotaxically. Spatial reference memory was performed using Morris Water Maze 21 days later. The expression of authophagy markers (beclin1, Atg7, Atg12, and LC3 II/LC3 I) in the hippocampus was evaluated using western blotting. Compared to the vehicle group, Abeta administration reduced spatial reference learning (P < 0.001) and memory (P < 0.01) and upregulated the expression of beclin1, Atg7, Atg12, and LC3 II/I (P < 0.0001). Compare to Abeta-only group, the administration of SP600125 and/or bucladesine improved spatial reference learning (P < 0.001) and memory (P < 0.01). Compared to the Abeta-only group, the treatment with SP600125 and/or bucladesine also reduced beclin1, Atg7, Atg12, and LC3 II/I (P < 0.0001) which was similar to amount of normal rats. In summary, it seems that the improvement of spatial memory by SP600125 and/or bucladesine in Abeta-injected rats is in relation with normalizing of autophagy to the physiologic level, possibly through neuroprotection and/or neuroplasticity.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by deposition of the amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in brain tissue of affected individuals. In recent years, many potential lead structures have been suggested that can potentially be used for diagnosis and therapy. However, the mode of action of these compounds is so far not understood. Among these small molecules, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) sulindac sulfide received a lot of attention. In this manuscript, we characterize the interaction between the monomeric Abeta peptide and the NSAID sulindac sulfide. We find that sulindac sulfide efficiently depletes the pool of toxic oligomers by enhancing the rate of fibril formation. In vitro, sulindac sulfide forms colloidal particles which catalyze the formation of fibrils. Aggregation is immediate, presumably by perturbing the supersaturated Abeta solution. We find that sulindac sulfide induced Abeta aggregates are structurally homogeneous. The C-terminal part of the peptide adopts a beta-sheet structure, whereas the N-terminus is disordered. The salt bridge between D23 and K28 is present, similar as in wild type fibril structures. (13)C-(19)F transferred echo double resonance experiments suggest that sulindac sulfide colocalizes with the Abeta peptide in the aggregate.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain leads to the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques, which is one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD). It is a general hypothesis that soluble prefibrillar assemblies of the Abeta peptide, rather than mature amyloid fibrils, cause neuronal dysfunction and memory impairment in AD. Thus, reducing the level of these prefibrillar species by using molecules that can interfere with the Abeta fibrillation pathway may be a valid approach to reduce Abeta cytotoxicity. Luminescent-conjugated oligothiophenes (LCOs) have amyloid binding properties and spectral properties that differ when they bind to protein aggregates with different morphologies and can therefore be used to visualize protein aggregates. In this study, cell toxicity experiments and biophysical studies demonstrated that the LCO p-FTAA was able to reduce the pool of soluble toxic Abeta species in favor of the formation of larger insoluble nontoxic amyloid fibrils, there by counteracting Abeta-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover, p-FTAA bound to early formed Abeta species and induced a rapid formation of beta-sheet structures. These p-FTAA generated amyloid fibrils were less hydrophobic and more resistant to proteolysis by proteinase K. In summary, our data show that p-FTAA promoted the formation of insoluble and stable Abeta species that were nontoxic which indicates that p-FTAA might have therapeutic potential.",

Because these oligomers are thought to be primarily responsible for the subsequent disease pathogenesis, the elucidation of their structure is of enormous interest. Nevertheless, because of the high aggregation propensity and the polydispersity of oligomeric species formed by the proteins or peptides in question, the preparation of appropriate samples for high-resolution structural methods has proven to be rather difficult. This is why theoretical approaches have been of particular importance in gaining insights into possible oligomeric structures for some time. Only recently has it been possible to achieve some progress with regard to the experimentally based structural characterization of defined oligomeric species. Here we discuss how theory and experiment are used to determine oligomer structures and what can be done to improve the integration of the two disciplines.",

Mid-life diabetes, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia are risk factors for the development of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). A key pathogenic feature of AD is the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brain. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of high fat diet feeding during early life on Abeta pathology in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD. Female mice were fed a standard (C) or high fat (HF) diet before mating and during gestation and lactation. At weaning, male offspring were fed a C diet. Significantly higher levels of guanidine-soluble Abeta and plaque loads were observed in the hippocampi of 11-month old Tg2576 mice born to mothers fed a HF diet. Changes in the extracellular matrix led to increased retention of Abeta within the parenchyma. These data support a role for maternal and gestational health on the health of the aged brain and pathologies associated with AD and may provide a novel target for both the prevention and treatment of AD.",

METHODS: In the population-based longitudinal Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, we studied 393 participants without dementia (340 clinically normal, 53 mild cognitive impairment; 70 years and older) who had cognitive and physical activity measures and at least 2 visits with imaging biomarkers. We dichotomized participants into high (>=14 years) and low (<14 years) education levels using the median. For the entire cohort and the 2 education strata, we built linear mixed models to investigate the effect of the predictors on each of the biomarker outcomes. RESULTS: Age was associated with amyloid and neurodegeneration trajectories; APOE4 status appears to influence only the amyloid and FDG trajectories but not hippocampal volume trajectory. In the high-education stratum, high midlife cognitive activity was associated with lower amyloid deposition in APOE4 carriers. APOE4 status was associated with lower FDG uptake in the entire cohort and in participants with lower education but not the high-education cohort. CONCLUSIONS: There were minimal effects of lifestyle enrichment on AD biomarker trajectories (specifically rates). Lifetime intellectual enrichment (high education, high midlife cognitive activity) is associated with lower amyloid in APOE4 carriers. High education is protective from the APOE4 effect on FDG metabolism. Differing education levels may explain the conflicting results seen in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Recently, phosphodiesterase-9 (PDE9) inhibitors and biometal-chelators have received much attention as potential therapeutics for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated a novel series of PDE9 inhibitors with the ability to chelate metal ions. The bioassay results showed that most of these molecules strongly inhibited PDE9 activity. Compound 16 showed an IC50 of 34 nM against PDE9 and more than 55-fold selectivity against other PDEs. In addition, this compound displayed remarkable metal-chelating capacity and a considerable ability to halt copper redox cycling. Notably, in comparison to the reference compound clioquinol, it inhibited metal-induced Abeta(1-42) aggregation more effectively and promoted greater disassembly of the highly structured Abeta fibrils generated through Cu(2+)-induced Abeta aggregation. These activities of 16, together with its favorable blood-brain barrier permeability, suggest that 16 may be a promising compound for treatment of AD.",

This study reveals that ultrasonic cavitation bubbles behave as catalysts for nucleation of the peptide: The nucleation reaction is highly dependent on frequency and pressure of acoustic wave, and we discover an optimum acoustical condition, at which the reaction-rate constant for nucleation is increased by three-orders-of magnitudes. A theoretical model is proposed for explaining highly frequency and pressure dependent nucleation reaction, where monomers are captured on the bubble surface during its growth and highly condensed by subsequent bubble collapse, so that they are transiently exposed to high temperatures. Thus, the dual effects of local condensation and local heating contribute to dramatically enhance the nucleation reaction. Our model consistently reproduces the frequency and pressure dependences, supporting its essential applicability.",

    "title": "Immunosenescence of microglia and macrophages: impact on the ageing central nervous system.",
    "abstract": "Ageing of the central nervous system results in a loss of both grey and white matter, leading to cognitive decline. Additional injury to both the grey and white matter is documented in many neurological disorders with ageing, including Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, stroke, and multiple sclerosis. Accompanying neuronal and glial damage is an inflammatory response consisting of activated macrophages and microglia, innate immune cells demonstrated to be both beneficial and detrimental in neurological repair. This article will propose the following: (i) infiltrating macrophages age differently from central nervous system-intrinsic microglia; (ii) several mechanisms underlie the differential ageing process of these two distinct cell types; and (iii) therapeutic strategies that selectively target these diverse mechanisms may rejuvenate macrophages and microglia for repair in the ageing central nervous system. Most responses of macrophages are diminished with senescence, but activated microglia increase their expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines while diminishing chemotactic and phagocytic activities. The senescence of macrophages and microglia has a negative impact on several neurological diseases, and the mechanisms underlying their age-dependent phenotypic changes vary from extrinsic microenvironmental changes to intrinsic changes in genomic integrity. We discuss the negative effects of age on neurological diseases, examine the response of senescent macrophages and microglia in these conditions, and propose a theoretical framework of therapeutic strategies that target the different mechanisms contributing to the ageing phenotype in these two distinct cell types. Rejuvenation of ageing macrophage/microglia may preserve neurological integrity and promote regeneration in the ageing central nervous system.",

    "title": "Shared genetic contribution to Ischaemic Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Increasing evidence suggests epidemiological and pathological links between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Ischaemic Stroke (IS). We investigated the evidence that shared genetic factors underpin the two diseases. METHODS: Using genome wide association study (GWAS) data from METASTROKE+ (15,916 IS cases and 68,826 controls) and IGAP (17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls), we evaluated known associations with AD and IS. On the subset of data for which we could obtain compatible genotype-level data (4,610 IS cases, 1,281 AD cases and 14,320 controls), we estimated the genome-wide genetic correlation (rG) between AD and IS, and the three subtypes (cardioembolic, small vessel, large vessel), using genome-wide SNP data. We then performed a meta-analysis and pathway analysis in the combined AD and small vessel stroke datasets to identify the SNPs and molecular pathways through which disease risk may be conferred. RESULTS: We found evidence of a shared genetic contribution between AD and small vessel stroke (rG(SE)=0.37(0.17); p=0.011). Conversely, there was no evidence to support shared genetic factors in AD and IS overall, or with the other stroke subtypes. Of the known GWAS associations with IS or AD, none reached significance for association with the other trait (or stroke subtypes). A meta-analysis of AD IGAP and METASTROKE+ small vessel stroke GWAS data highlighted a region (ATP5H/KCTD2/ICT1), associated with both diseases (p=1.8x10-8 ). A pathway analysis identified four associated pathways, involving cholesterol transport and immune response. INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate shared genetic susceptibility to AD and small vessel stroke and highlight potential causal pathways and loci. This article is protected by copyright.

    "abstract": "The deposition of Amyloid beta peptide plaques is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Abeta (25-35) peptide is regarded as the toxic fragment of full-length Abeta (1-42). The mechanism of its toxicity is not completely understood, along with its contribution to AD pathological processes. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the neurotoxic Abeta (25-35) peptide on the expression of the neuroprotective factors Pin1, Sirtuin1, and Bdnf in human neuroblastoma cells. Levels of Pin1, Sirtuin 1, and Bdnf were compared by real-time PCR and Western blotting in SH-SY5Y cells treated with Abeta (25-35) or administration vehicle. The level of Pin1 gene and protein expression was significantly decreased in cells exposed to 25 muM Abeta (25-35) compared to vehicle-treated controls. Similarly, Sirtuin1 expression was significantly reduced by Abeta (25-35) exposure. In contrast, both Bdnf mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased by Abeta (25-35) treatment, suggesting the activation of a compensatory response to the insult. Both Pin1 and Sirtuin 1 exert a protective role by reducing the probability of plaque deposition, since they promote amyloid precursor protein processing through non-amyloidogenic pathways. The present results show that Abeta (25-35) peptide reduced the production of these neuroprotective proteins, thus further increasing Abeta generation.",

However, thioflavin probes have limitations in their diagnostic capabilities arising from a number of undesireable qualities, including poor photostability, weak emission intensity, and high emission overlap with the backgound tissue autofluorescence. To overcome such limitations, we have developed nanoformulated probes consisting of a red-emitting fluorescent quantum dot (QD) core encapsulated in a PEGylated shell with benzotriazole (BTA) targeting molecules on the surface (QD-PEG-BTA). The combination of strong red fluorescence, multivalent binding, and decreased backgound signal and nonspecific binding provided the ability of the QD-PEG-BTA probes to achieve detection sensitivites 4 orders of magnitude greater than those of conventional thioflavin derivatives.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) is a nondestructive method to observe the aggregation process in solution. We show that SANS is able to resolve monomers of small molecular weight like Abeta for aggregation studies. We examine Abeta monomers after prolonged storing in d-hexafluoroisopropanol (dHFIP) by using SANS and dynamic light scattering (DLS). We determined the radius of gyration from SANS as 1.0+-0.1 nm for Abeta1-40 and 1.6+-0.1 nm for Abeta1-42 in agreement with 3D NMR structures in similar solvents suggesting a solvent surface layer with 5% increased density. After initial dissolution in dHFIP Abeta aggregates sediment with a major component of pure monomers showing a hydrodynamic radius of 1.8+-0.3 nm for Abeta1-40 and 3.2+-0.4 nm for Abeta1-42 including a surface layer of dHFIP solvent molecules.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is initially characterized as a disease of the synapse that affects synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. While amyloid-beta and tau have been traditionally implicated in causing AD, recent studies suggest that other factors, such as the intracellular domain of the amyloid-precursor protein (APP-ICD), can also play a role in the development of AD. Here, we show that the expression of APP-ICD induces synaptic depression, while the intracellular domain of its homolog amyloid-like precursor protein 2 (APLP2-ICD) does not. We are able to show that this effect by APP-ICD is due to a single alanine vs. proline difference between APP-ICD and APLP2-ICD. The alanine in APP-ICD and the proline in APLP2-ICD lie directly behind a conserved caspase cleavage site. Inhibition of caspase cleavage of APP-ICD prevents the induction of synaptic depression. Finally, we show that the expression of APP-ICD increases and facilitates long-term depression and blocks induction of long-term potentiation. The block in long-term potentiation can be overcome by mutating the aforementioned alanine in APP-ICD to the proline of APLP2. Based on our results, we propose the emergence of a new APP critical domain for the regulation of synaptic plasticity and in consequence for the development of AD.",

    "abstract": "PSEN1 mutations are the most frequent cause of autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD), and show nearly full penetrance. There is presently increasing interest in the study of biomarkers that track disease progression in order to test therapeutic interventions in ADAD. We used white mater (WM) volumetric characteristics and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics to investigate correlations with the normalized time to expected symptoms onset (relative age ratio) and group differences in a cohort of 36 subjects from PSEN1 ADAD families: 22 mutation carriers, 10 symptomatic (SMC) and 12 asymptomatic (AMC), and 14 non-carriers (NC). Subjects underwent a 3T MRI. WM morphometric data and DTI metrics were analyzed. We found that PSEN1 MC showed significant negative correlation between fractional anisotropy (FA) and the relative age ratio in the genus and body of corpus callosum and corona radiate (p <  0.05 Family-wise error correction (FWE) at cluster level) and positive correlation with mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AxD), and radial diffusivity (RD) in the splenium of corpus callosum. SMC presented WM volume loss, reduced FA and increased MD, AxD, and RD in the anterior and posterior corona radiate, corpus callosum (p <  0.05 FWE) compared with NC. No significant differences were observed between AMC and NC in WM volume or DTI measures. These findings suggest that the integrity of the WM deteriorates linearly in PSEN1 ADAD from the early phases of the disease; thus DTI metrics might be useful to monitor the disease progression. However, the lack of significant alterations at the preclinical stages suggests that these indexes might not be good candidates for early markers of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Development of disease-modifying therapeutics is urgently needed for treating Alzheimer disease (AD). AD is characterized by toxic beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides produced by beta- and gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). beta-secretase inhibitors reduce Abeta levels, but mechanism-based side effects arise because they also inhibit beta-cleavage of non-amyloid substrates like Neuregulin. We report that beta-secretase has a higher affinity for Neuregulin than it does for APP. Kinetic studies demonstrate that the affinities and catalytic efficiencies of beta-secretase are higher toward non-amyloid substrates than toward APP. We show that non-amyloid substrates are processed by beta-secretase in an endocytosis-independent manner. Exploiting this compartmentalization of substrates, we specifically target the endosomal beta-secretase by an endosomally targeted beta-secretase inhibitor, which blocked cleavage of APP but not non-amyloid substrates in many cell systems, including induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. beta-secretase inhibitors can be designed to specifically inhibit the Alzheimer process, enhancing their potential as AD therapeutics without undesired side effects.",

Abeta plaques are produced through sequential beta/gamma cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), of which there are three main APP isoforms: APP695, APP751 and APP770. KPI-APPs (APP751 and APP770) are known to be elevated in AD, but the reason remains unclear. Transcription activator-like (TAL) effector nucleases (TALENs) induce mutations with high efficiency at specific genomic loci, and it is thus possible to knock out specific regions using TALENs. In this study, we designed and expressed TALENs specific for the C-terminus of APP in HeLa cells, in which KPI-APPs are predominantly expressed. The KPI-APP mutants lack a 12-aa region that encompasses a 5-aa trans-membrane (TM) region and 7-aa juxta-membrane (JM) region. The mutated KPI-APPs exhibited decreased mitochondrial localization. In addition, mitochondrial morphology was altered, resulting in an increase in spherical mitochondria in the mutant cells through the disruption of the balance between fission and fusion. Mitochondrial dysfunction, including decreased ATP levels, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, increased ROS generation and impaired mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, was also found. These results suggest that specific regions of KPI-APPs are important for mitochondrial localization and function.",

    "abstract": "Why do patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases generate autoantibodies that selectively bind soluble aggregates of amyloidogenic proteins? Presently, molecular basis of interactions between the soluble aggregates and human immune system is unknown. By analyzing sequences of experimentally validated T-cell autoimmune epitopes, aggregating peptides, amyloidogenic proteins and randomly generated peptides, here we report overlapping regions that likely drive aggregation as well as generate autoantibodies against the aggregates. Sequence features, that make short peptides susceptible to aggregation, increase their incidence in human T-cell autoimmune epitopes by 4-6 times. Many epitopes are predicted to be significantly aggregation prone (aggregation propensities >=10%) and the ones containing experimentally validated aggregating regions are enriched in hydrophobicity by 10-20%. Aggregate morphologies also influence Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)--types recognized by the aggregating regions containing epitopes. Most (88%) epitopes that contain amyloid fibril forming regions bind HLA-DR, while majority (63%) of those containing amorphous beta-aggregating regions bind HLA-DQ. More than two-thirds (70%) of human amyloidogenic proteins contain overlapping regions that are simultaneously aggregation prone and auto-immunogenic. Such regions help clear soluble aggregates by generating selective autoantibodies against them. This can be harnessed for early diagnosis of proteinopathies and for drug/vaccine design against them.",

We found that boronic acid as a functional group improved the binding affinity (KD value=0.79+-0.05muM for 4c) for Abeta aggregates and confirmed that 4c selectively stained Abeta plaques in brain sections from APP/PS1 mice. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging using mice (normal and APP/PS1) also revealed that 4c was able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and to stain Abeta plaques in the brain.

    "abstract": "The conversion of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide into pathogenic aggregates is linked to the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Although this observation has prompted an extensive search for therapeutic agents to modulate the concentration of Abeta or inhibit its aggregation, all clinical trials with these objectives have so far failed, at least in part because of a lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the process of aggregation and its inhibition. To address this problem, we describe a chemical kinetics approach for rational drug discovery, in which the effects of small molecules on the rates of specific microscopic steps in the self-assembly of Abeta42, the most aggregation-prone variant of Abeta, are analyzed quantitatively. By applying this approach, we report that bexarotene, an anticancer drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, selectively targets the primary nucleation step in Abeta42 aggregation, delays the formation of toxic species in neuroblastoma cells, and completely suppresses Abeta42 deposition and its consequences in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of Abeta42-mediated toxicity. These results suggest that the prevention of the primary nucleation of Abeta42 by compounds such as bexarotene could potentially reduce the risk of onset of Alzheimer's disease and, more generally, that our strategy provides a general framework for the rational identification of a range of candidate drugs directed against neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "title": "APOE2 eases cognitive decline during Aging: Clinical and preclinical evaluations.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Apolipoprotein E (apoE), a major cholesterol carrier in the brain, is associated with a strong risk for Alzheimer disease. Compared to the risky APOE4 gene allele, the effects of the protective APOE2 gene allele are vastly understudied, and thus need to be further clarified. METHODS: We reviewed National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center clinical records and performed preclinical experiments using human apoE-targeted replacement (apoE-TR) mice, which do not show amyloid pathology. RESULTS: Clinically, the APOE2 allele was associated with less cognitive decline during aging. This effect was also seen in subjects with little amyloid pathology, or after adjusting for Alzheimer disease-related pathologies. In animal studies, aged apoE2-TR mice also exhibited preserved memory function in water maze tests. Regardless, apoE2-TR mice showed similar or greater age-related changes in synaptic loss, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress compared to apoE3-TR or apoE4-TR mice. Interestingly, apoE concentrations in the cortex, hippocampus, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were positively correlated with memory performance across apoE isoforms, where apoE2-TR mice had higher apoE levels. Moreover, apoE2-TR mice exhibited the lowest levels of cholesterol in the cortex, despite higher levels in CSF and plasma. These cholesterol levels were associated with apoE levels and memory performance across apoE isoforms. INTERPRETATION: APOE2 is associated with less cognitive decline during aging. This can occur independently of age-related synaptic/neuroinflammatory changes and amyloid accumulation. Higher levels of apoE and associated cholesterol metabolism in APOE2 carriers might contribute to this protective effect. Ann Neurol 2016;79:758-774.",

    "abstract": "One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the formation of protein plaques in the brain, which mainly consist of amyloid-beta peptides of different lengths. While the role of these plaques in the pathology of the disease is not clear, the mechanism behind peptide aggregation is a topic of intense research and discussion. Because of their simplicity, synthetic membranes are promising model systems to identify the elementary processes involved. We prepared unsaturated zwitterionic/anionic lipid membranes made of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine (POPC) and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DMPS) at concentrations of POPC/3 mol% DMPS containing 0 mol%, 3 mol%, 10 mol%, and 20 mol% amyloid-beta25-35 peptides. Membrane-embedded peptide clusters were observed at peptide concentrations of 10 and 20 mol% with a typical cluster size of ~11 mum. Cluster density increased with peptide concentration from 59 (+-3) clusters per mm(2) to 920 (+-64) clusters per mm(2), respectively. While monomeric peptides take an alpha-helical state when embedded in lipid bilayers at low peptide concentrations, the peptides in peptide clusters were found to form cross-beta sheets and showed the characteristic pattern in X-ray experiments. The presence of the peptides was accompanied by an elastic distortion of the bilayers, which can induce a long range interaction between the peptides. The experimentally observed cluster patterns agree well with Monte Carlo simulations of long-range interacting peptides. This interaction may be the fundamental process behind cross-beta sheet formation in membranes and these sheets may serve as seeds for further growth into amyloid fibrils.",

    "abstract": "SEE THAL AND VANDENBERGHE DOI101093/BRAIN/AWW057 FOR A SCIENTIFIC COMMENTARY ON THIS ARTICLE: Post-mortem Braak staging of neurofibrillary tau tangle topographical distribution is one of the core neuropathological criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The recent development of positron emission tomography tracers targeting neurofibrillary tangles has enabled the distribution of tau pathology to be imaged in living subjects. Methods for extraction of classic Braak staging from in vivo imaging of neurofibrillary tau tangles have not yet been explored. Standardized uptake value ratio images were calculated from 80-100 minute (18)F-AV-1451 (also known as T807) positron emission tomography scans obtained from n = 14 young reference subjects (age 21-39 years, Mini-Mental State Examination 29-30) and n = 173 older test subjects (age 50-95 years) comprising amyloid negative cognitively normal (n = 42), clinically-diagnosed mild cognitive impairment (amyloid positive, n = 47, and amyloid negative, n = 40) and Alzheimer's disease (amyloid positive, n = 28, and amyloid negative, n = 16). We defined seven regions of interest in anterior temporal lobe and occipital lobe sections corresponding closely to those used as decision points in Braak staging. An algorithm based on the Braak histological staging procedure was applied to estimate Braak stages directly from the region of interest profiles in each subject. Quantitative region-based analysis of (18)F-AV-1451 images yielded region of interest and voxel level profiles that mirrored key features of neuropathological tau progression including profiles consistent with Braak stages 0 through VI. A simple set of decision rules enabled plausible Braak stages corresponding to stereotypical progression patterns to be objectively estimated in 149 (86%) of test subjects. An additional 12 (7%) subjects presented with predefined variant profiles (relative sparing of the hippocampus and/or occipital lobe). The estimated Braak stage was significantly associated with amyloid status, diagnostic category and measures of global cognition. In vivo (18)F-AV-1451 positron emission tomography images across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum could be classified into patterns similar to those prescribed by Braak neuropathological staging of tau pathology.",

Employing structure-based design, truncation of the cyanophenyl group of 6 that binds in the S3 pocket of BACE1 followed by modification of the thienyl group in S1 was pursued. Optimization of the pyrimidine substituent that binds in the S2'-S2'' pocket of BACE1 remediated time-dependent CYP3A4 inhibition of earlier analogues in this series and imparted high BACE1 affinity. These efforts resulted in the discovery of difluorophenyl analogue 9 (MBi-4), which robustly lowered CSF and cortex Abeta40 in both rats and cynomolgus monkeys following a single oral dose. Compound 9 represents a unique molecular shape among BACE inhibitors reported to potently lower central Abeta in nonrodent preclinical species.",

Using the tau PET agent (18)F-AV-1451, we examined retention patterns in cognitively normal older people in relation to young controls and AD patients. Age and beta-amyloid (measured using PiB PET) were differentially associated with tau tracer retention in healthy aging. Older age was related to increased tracer retention in regions of the medial temporal lobe, which predicted worse episodic memory performance. PET detection of tau in other isocortical regions required the presence of cortical beta-amyloid and was associated with decline in global cognition. Furthermore, patterns of tracer retention corresponded well with Braak staging of neurofibrillary tau pathology.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by extracellular beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and microglia-dominated neuroinflammation. The Nogo/NgR signal pathway is involved in AD pathological features, but the detailed mechanism needs further investigation. Our previous studies have confirmed that the activation of NgR on microglia by Nogo promotes the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and inhibits cell adhesion and migration behaviors. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Nogo/NgR signaling pathway on the pathological features of AD and possible mechanisms. METHODS: After NEP1-40 (a competitive antagonist of Nogo/NgR pathway) was intracerebroventricularly administered via mini-osmotic pumps for 2 months in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/PS1 transgenic mice, plaque load, tau phosphorylation, and inflammatory responses were determined. After primary mouse neurons were exposed to the conditioned medium from BV-2 microglia stimulated by Nogo, the production of Abeta and phosphorylation of tau was quantified by ELISA and western blot. RESULTS: Inhibition of the Nogo/NgR signaling pathway ameliorated pathological features including amyloid plaques and phosphorylated levels of tau in APP/PS1 mice. In addition, after treatment with the conditioned medium from BV-2 microglia stimulated by Nogo, Abeta production and tau phosphorylation in cultured neurons were increased. The conditioned medium also increased the expression of APP, its amyloidogenic processing, and the activity of GSK3beta in neurons. The conditioned medium was also proinflammatory medium, and the blockage of the Nogo/NgR pathway improved the neuroinflammatory environment in APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the neuroinflammation mediated by Nogo/NgR pathway in microglia could directly take part in the pathological process of AD by influencing the amyloidogenesis and tau phosphorylation. These results contribute to a better understanding of AD pathogenesis and could offer a new therapeutic option for delaying the progression of AD.",

Cell Counting Kit-8 staining was used to measure cell viability, laser-scanning confocal imaging was used to detect changes in intracellular free calcium concentration, and western blot assay was used to measure neuronal PI3K-p85 expression. Soluble Abeta25-35 was found to reduce cell viability and induce calcium overload in primary cultured rat cerebral cortical neurons, in a concentration-dependent manner. At certain concentrations, soluble Abeta25-35 also increased neuronal PI3K-p85 expression. These findings reveal that soluble Abeta25-35 reduces the viability of cultured cerebral cortical rat neurons.

    "abstract": "TREM2 is an innate immune receptor expressed on the surface of microglia. Loss-of-function mutations of TREM2 are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). TREM2 is a type-1 protein with an ectodomain that is proteolytically cleaved and released into the extracellular space as a soluble variant (sTREM2), which can be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In this cross-sectional multicenter study, we investigated whether CSF levels of sTREM2 are changed during the clinical course of AD, and in cognitively normal individuals with suspected non-AD pathology (SNAP). CSF sTREM2 levels were higher in mild cognitive impairment due to AD than in all other AD groups and controls. SNAP individuals also had significantly increased CSF sTREM2 compared to controls. Moreover, increased CSF sTREM2 levels were associated with higher CSF total tau and phospho-tau181P, which are markers of neuronal degeneration and tau pathology. Our data demonstrate that CSF sTREM2 levels are increased in the early symptomatic phase of AD, probably reflecting a corresponding change of the microglia activation status in response to neuronal degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Altered GSK-3beta activity can contribute to a number of pathological processes including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Indeed, GSK-3beta catalyzes the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein by transferring a phosphate moiety from ATP to the protein substrate serine residue causing the formation of the toxic insoluble neurofibrillary tangles; for this reason it represents a key target for the development of new therapeutic agents for AD treatment. Herein we describe a new selective UHPLC methodology developed for the direct characterization of GSK-3beta kinase activity and for the determination of its inhibition, which could be crucial in AD drug discovery. The UHPLC-UV (DAD) based method was validated for the very fast determination of ATP as reactant and ADP as product, and applied for the analysis of the enzymatic reaction between a phosphate primed peptide substrate (GSM), resembling tau protein sequence, ATP and GSK-3beta, with/without inhibitors. Analysis time was ten times improved, when compared with previously published chromatographic methods. The method was also validated by determining enzyme reaction kinetic constants (KM and vmax) for GSM and ATP and by analyzing well known GSK-3beta inhibitors. Inhibition potency (IC50) values for SB-415286 (81 +- 6 nM) and for Tideglusib (251 +- 17 nM), found by the newly developed UHPLC method, were in good agreement with the luminescence method taken as independent reference method. Further on, the UHPLC method was applied to the elucidation of Tideglusib mechanism of action by determining its inhibition constants (Ki). In agreement with literature data, Tideglusib resulted a GSM competitive inhibitor, whereas SB-415286 was found inhibiting GSK-3beta in an ATP competitive manner. This method was applied to the determination of the potency of a new lead compound and was found potentially scalable to inhibitor screening of large compounds collections.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests a link between the presence of subjective memory complaints (SMC) and lower volume of the hippocampus, one of the first regions to show neuropathological lesions in Alzheimer's disease. However, it remains unknown whether this pattern of hippocampal atrophy is regionally specific and whether SMC are also paralleled by changes in peripheral levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta). METHODS: The volume of hippocampal subregions and plasma Abeta levels were cross-sectionally compared between elderly individuals with (SMC(+); N = 47) and without SMC (SMC(-); N = 48). Significant volume differences in hippocampal subregions were further correlated with plasma Abeta levels and with objective memory performance. RESULTS: Individuals with SMC exhibited significantly higher Abeta1-42 concentrations and lower volumes of CA1, CA4, dentate gyrus, and molecular layer compared with SMC(-) participants. Regression analyses further showed significant associations between lower volume of the dentate gyrus and both poorer memory performance and higher plasma Abeta1-42 levels in SMC(+) participants. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of SMC, lower volumes of specific hippocampal regions, and higher plasma Abeta1-42 levels could be conditions associated with aging vulnerability. If such associations are confirmed in longitudinal studies, the combination may be markers recommending clinical follow-up in nondemented older adults.",

    "abstract": "Post-learning hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) generated during slow wave sleep are thought to play a crucial role in memory formation. While in Alzheimer's disease, abnormal hippocampal oscillations have been reported, the functional contribution of SWRs to the typically observed spatial memory impairments remains unclear. These impairments have been related to degenerative synaptic changes produced by soluble amyloid beta oligomers (Abetaos) which, surprisingly, seem to spare the SWR dynamics during routine behavior. To unravel a potential effect of Abetaos on SWRs in cognitively-challenged animals, we submitted vehicle- and Abetao-injected mice to spatial recognition memory testing. While capable of forming short-term recognition memory, Abeta mice exhibited faster forgetting, suggesting successful encoding but an inability to adequately stabilize and/or retrieve previously acquired information. Without prior cognitive requirements, similar properties of SWRs were observed in both groups. In contrast, when cognitively challenged, the post-encoding and -recognition peaks in SWR occurrence observed in controls were abolished in Abeta mice, indicating impaired hippocampal processing of spatial information. These results point to a crucial involvement of SWRs in spatial memory formation and identify the Abeta-induced impairment in SWRs dynamics as a disruptive mechanism responsible for the spatial memory deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is a common and early symptom of many neurodegenerative diseases, particularly of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment, pointing to the progression to dementia. Recent studies have revealed that valproic acid (VPA) has neuroprotective effects in rodent models of AD. In this study, we investigated the effects of VPA on olfactory dysfunction of APP/PS1 double transgenic mouse models of AD. After continuous treatment with a 100mg/kg daily dose of VPA for 3 months, APP/PS1 mice showed improved olfactory performances. In agreement with the behavioral findings, VPA treatment reduced amyloid beta (Abeta) burden in the olfactory epithelium (OE) of transgenic mice. And, VPA increased epithelial thickness of the olfactory mucosa through decreased cell apoptosis and increased cell proliferation. In the olfactory bulb (OB), VPA administration also reduced senile plaques and levels of soluble and insoluble Abeta42 peptides. Besides, VPA promoted the increase of mitral cells and decrease of neurofilament immunostaining. In hence, VPA treatment completely improved the olfactory performances and prevented degenerative changes of the OE and OB. Our study raises the possibility of AD diagnosis by OE biopsy. Moreover, VPA may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of olfactory dysfunction in AD patients.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenic process in Alzheimer's disease (AD) appears to be closely linked to the neurotoxic action of amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers. Recent studies have shown that these oligomers bind with high affinity to the membrane-anchored cellular prion protein (PrP(C)). It has also been proposed that this binding might mediate some of the toxic effects of the oligomers. Here, we show that the soluble (membrane anchor-free) recombinant human prion protein (rPrP) and its N-terminal fragment N1 block Abeta oligomers-induced inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices, an important surrogate marker of cognitive deficit associated with AD. rPrP and N1 are also strikingly potent inhibitors of Abeta cytotoxicity in primary hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, experiments using hippocampal slices and neurons from wild-type and PrP(C) null mice (as well as rat neurons in which PrP(C) expression was greatly reduced by gene silencing) indicate that, in contrast to the impairment of synaptic plasticity by Abeta oligomers, the cytotoxic effects of these oligomers, and the inhibition of these effects by rPrP and N1, are independent of the presence of endogenous PrP(C). This suggests fundamentally different mechanisms by which soluble rPrP and its fragments inhibit these two toxic responses to Abeta. Overall, these findings provide strong support to recent suggestions that PrP-based compounds may offer new avenues for pharmacological intervention in AD.",

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) participates in multiple molecular pathways implicated in AD, and its expression and activity are reduced in postmortem brains of AD patients. PP2A is regulated by protein methylation, and impaired PP2A methylation is thought to contribute to increased AD risk in hyperhomocysteinemic individuals. To examine further the link between PP2A and AD, we generated transgenic mice that overexpress the PP2A methylesterase, protein phosphatase methylesterase-1 (PME-1), or the PP2A methyltransferase, leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1 (LCMT-1), and examined the sensitivity of these animals to behavioral and electrophysiological impairments caused by exogenous Abeta exposure. We found that PME-1 overexpression enhanced these impairments, whereas LCMT-1 overexpression protected against Abeta-induced impairments. Neither transgene affected Abeta production or the electrophysiological response to low concentrations of Abeta, suggesting that these manipulations selectively affect the pathological response to elevated Abeta levels. Together these data identify a molecular mechanism linking PP2A to the development of AD-related cognitive impairments that might be therapeutically exploited to target selectively the pathological effects caused by elevated Abeta levels in AD patients.",

    "title": "Inhibition of the Motor Protein Eg5/Kinesin-5 in Amyloid beta-Mediated Impairment of Hippocampal Long-Term Potentiation and Dendritic Spine Loss.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, and neurodegeneration. However, this pathology is preceded by increased soluble amyloid beta (Abeta) 1-42 oligomers that interfere with the glutamatergic synaptic plasticity required for learning and memory, includingN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). In particular, soluble Abeta(1-42) acutely inhibits LTP and chronically causes synapse loss. Many mechanisms have been proposed for Abeta-induced synaptic dysfunction, but we recently found that Abeta(1-42) inhibits the microtubule motor protein Eg5/kinesin-5. Here we compared the impacts of Abeta(1-42) and monastrol, a small-molecule Eg5 inhibitor, on LTP in hippocampal slices and synapse loss in neuronal cultures. Acute (20-minute) treatment with monastrol, like Abeta, completely inhibited LTP at doses >100 nM. In addition, 1 nM Abeta(1-42) or 50 nM monastrol inhibited LTP #x223c;50%, and when applied together caused complete LTP inhibition. At concentrations that impaired LTP, neither Abeta(1-42) nor monastrol inhibited NMDAR synaptic responses until #x223c;60 minutes, when only #x223c;25% inhibition was seen for monastrol, indicating that NMDAR inhibition was not responsible for LTP inhibition by either agent when applied for only 20 minutes. Finally, 48 hours of treatment with either 0.5-1.0muM Abeta(1-42) or 1-5muM monastrol reduced the dendritic spine/synapse density in hippocampal cultures up to a maximum of #x223c;40%, and when applied together at maximal concentrations, no additional spine loss resulted. Thus, monastrol can mimic and in some cases occlude the impact of Abetaon LTP and synapse loss, suggesting that Abetainduces acute and chronic synaptic dysfunction in part through inhibiting Eg5.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty male C57bl/6 mice were divided into five groups: low, middle, and high concentration, model, and control groups. Intracerebroventricular injection of beta-amyloid25-35 in C57bl/6 mice caused an impairment of learning and memory. Next day, intragastric administration of procyanidins in the treatment group mice: (lower, middle and high concentration). Hoechst staining observed apoptosis of neuronal nuclei in the hippocampus. Immunohistochemistry determined synaptic remodeling reaction and the expression level of glial inflammatory response. RESULTS: Compared with the model group, the proportion of neuronal apoptosis decreased in the hippocampal CA1 region of the treatment group. The Synaptic (SYN) density was increased, and the level of activated astrocytes and microglia expression in the hippocampus was decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Procyanidins have a protective influence on Abeta25-35 mice hippocampus neuron, reducing nerve cell damage and eases learning and memory deficit.",

    "title": "Tau PET patterns mirror clinical and neuroanatomical variability in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "SEE SARAZIN ET AL DOI101093/BRAIN/AWW041 FOR A SCIENTIFIC COMMENTARY ON THIS ARTICLE: The advent of the positron emission tomography tracer (18)F-AV1451 provides the unique opportunity to visualize the regional distribution of tau pathology in the living human brain. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that tau pathology is closely linked to symptomatology and patterns of glucose hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease, in contrast to the more diffuse distribution of amyloid-beta pathology. We included 20 patients meeting criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease dementia or mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, presenting with a variety of clinical phenotypes, and 15 amyloid-beta-negative cognitively normal individuals, who underwent (18)F-AV1451 (tau), (11)C-PiB (amyloid-beta) and (18)F-FDG (glucose metabolism) positron emission tomography, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping and neuropsychological testing. Voxel-wise contrasts against controls (at P < 0.05 family-wise error corrected) showed that (18)F-AV1451 and (18)F-FDG patterns in patients with posterior cortical atrophy ('visual variant of Alzheimer's disease', n = 7) specifically targeted the clinically affected posterior brain regions, while (11)C-PiB bound diffusely throughout the neocortex. Patients with an amnestic-predominant presentation (n = 5) showed highest (18)F-AV1451 retention in medial temporal and lateral temporoparietal regions. Patients with logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia ('language variant of Alzheimer's disease', n = 5) demonstrated asymmetric left greater than right hemisphere (18)F-AV1451 uptake in three of five patients. Across 30 FreeSurfer-defined regions of interest in 16 Alzheimer's disease patients with all three positron emission tomography scans available, there was a strong negative association between (18)F-AV1451 and (18)F-FDG uptake (Pearson's r = -0.49 +- 0.07, P < 0.001) and less pronounced positive associations between (11)C-PiB and (18)F-FDG (Pearson's r = 0.16 +- 0.09, P < 0.001) and (18)F-AV1451 and (11)C-PiB (Pearson's r = 0.18 +- 0.09, P < 0.001). Voxel-wise linear regressions thresholded at P < 0.05 (uncorrected) showed that, across all patients, younger age was associated with greater (18)F-AV1451 uptake in wide regions of the neocortex, while older age was associated with increased (18)F-AV1451 in the medial temporal lobe. APOE epsilon4 carriers showed greater temporal and parietal (18)F-AV1451 uptake than non-carriers. Finally, worse performance on domain-specific neuropsychological tests was associated with greater (18)F-AV1451 uptake in key regions implicated in memory (medial temporal lobes), visuospatial function (occipital, right temporoparietal cortex) and language (left > right temporoparietal cortex). In conclusion, tau imaging-contrary to amyloid-beta imaging-shows a strong regional association with clinical and anatomical heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease. Although preliminary, these results are consistent with and expand upon findings from post-mortem, animal and cerebrospinal fluid studies, and suggest that the pathological aggregation of tau is closely linked to patterns of neurodegeneration and clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by a progressive cognitive decline along with various neuropsychiatric symptoms, including depression and anxiety. Increasing evidence has been proposed the activation of the tryptophan-degrading indoleamine-2,3-dyoxigenase (IDO), the rate-limiting enzyme of kynurerine pathway (KP), as a pathogenic factor of amyloid-beta (Abeta)-related inflammation in AD. In the current study, the effects of an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of Abeta1-42 peptide (400pmol/mice; 3mul/site) on the regulation of KP biomarkers (IDO activity, tryptophan and kynurerine levels) and the impact of Abeta1-42 on neurotrophic factors levels were investigated as potential mechanisms linking neuroinflammation to cognitive/emotional disturbances in mice. Our results demonstrated that Abeta1-42 induced memory impairment in the object recognition test. Abeta1-42 also induced emotional alterations, such as depressive and anxiety-like behaviors, as evaluated in the tail suspension and elevated-plus maze tests, respectively. We observed an increase in levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the Abeta1-42-treated mice, which led to an increase in IDO activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HC). The IDO activation subsequently increased kynurerine production and the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio and decreased the levels of neurotrophic factors in the PFC and HC, which contributed to Abeta-associated behavioral disturbances. The inhibition of IDO activation by IDO inhibitor 1-methyltryptophan (1-MT), prevented the development of behavioral and neurochemical alterations. These data demonstrate that brain IDO activation plays a key role in mediating the memory and emotional disturbances in an experimental model based on Abeta-induced neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The earliest stage of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by low levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta (Abeta42). However, covariance in longitudinal dynamic change of Abeta42 and tau in incipient preclinical AD is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To examine dynamic interrelationships between Abeta42 and tau in preclinical AD. METHODS: We followed 47 cognitively intact participants (CI) with available CSF data over four years in ADNI. Based on longitudinal Abeta42 levels in CSF, CI were classified into three groups: 1) Abeta42 stable with normal levels of Abeta42 over time (n = 15); 2) Abeta42 declining with normal Abeta42 levels at baseline but showing decline over time (n = 14); and 3) Abeta42 levels consistently abnormal (n = 18). RESULTS: In the Abeta42 declining group, suggestive of incipient preclinical AD, CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) showed a similar longitudinal pattern of increasing abnormality over time (p = 0.0001). Correlation between longitudinal slopes of Abeta42 and p-tau confirmed that both trajectories were anti-correlated (rho = -0.60; p = 0.02). Regression analysis showed that Abeta42 slope (decreasing Abeta42) predicted p-tau slope (increasing p-tau) (R2 = 0.47, p = 0.03). Atrophy in the hippocampus was predicted by the interaction of Abeta42 and p-tau slopes (p <  0.0001) only in this incipient preclinical AD group. In all groups combined, memory decline was predicted by p-tau. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of Abeta42 and p-tau CSF biomarkers in CI subjects follows an anti-correlated trajectory, i.e., as Abeta42 declined, p-tau increased, and thus was suggestive of strong temporal coincidence. Rapid pathogenic cross-talk between Abeta42 and p-tau thus may be evident in very early stages of preclinical AD.",

    "abstract": "The formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Here we have investigated the effect of soluble and aggregated amyloid-beta (Abeta) and alpha-synuclein (alphaS), associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, respectively, on the Cu(2+)-catalyzed formation of ROS in vitro in the presence of a biological reductant. We find that the levels of ROS, and the rate by which ROS is generated, are significantly reduced when Cu(2+) is bound to Abeta or alphaS, particularly when they are in their oligomeric or fibrillar forms. This effect is attributed to a combination of radical scavenging and redox silencing mechanisms. Our findings suggest that the increase in ROS associated with the accumulation of aggregated Abeta or alphaS does not result from a particularly ROS-active form of these peptides, but rather from either a local increase of Cu(2+) and other ROS-active metal ions in the aggregates or as a downstream consequence of the formation of the pathological amyloid structures.",

    "title": "Dietary DHA supplementation causes selective changes in phospholipids from different brain regions in both wild type mice and the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is of major concern in ageing populations and we have used the Tg2576 mouse model to understand connections between brain lipids and amyloid pathology. Because dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been identified as beneficial, we compared mice fed with a DHA-supplemented diet to those on a nutritionally-sufficient diet. Major phospholipids from cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum were separated and analysed. Each phosphoglyceride had a characteristic fatty acid composition which was similar in cortex and hippocampus but different in the cerebellum. The biggest changes on DHA-supplementation were within ethanolamine phospholipids which, together with phosphatidylserine, had the highest proportions of DHA. Reciprocal alterations in DHA and arachidonate were found. The main diet-induced alterations were found in ethanolamine phospholipids, (and included their ether derivatives), as were the changes observed due to genotype. Tg mice appeared more sensitive to diet with generally lower DHA percentages when on the standard diet and higher relative proportions of DHA when the diet was supplemented. All four major phosphoglycerides analysed showed age-dependent decreases in polyunsaturated fatty acid contents. These data provide, for the first time, a detailed evaluation of phospholipids in different brain areas previously shown to be relevant to behaviour in the Tg2576 mouse model for AD. The lipid changes observed with genotype are consistent with the subtle alterations found in AD patients, especially for the ethanolamine phospholipid molecular species. They also emphasise the contrasting changes in fatty acid content induced by DHA supplementation within individual phospholipid classes.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical and biomarker characteristics of patients with amyloid-negative Alzheimer disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a prospective cohort study. METHODS: We first investigated the reliability of florbetapir- PET in patients with AD and patients with MCI using CSF-Abeta1-42 as a comparison amyloid measurement. We then compared florbetapir- vs florbetapir+ patients with respect to several AD-specific biomarkers, baseline and longitudinal cognitive measurements, and demographic and clinician report data. RESULTS: Florbetapir and CSF-Abeta1-42 +/- status agreed for 98% of ADs (89% of MCIs), indicating that most florbetapir- scans were a reliable representation of amyloid status. Florbetapir- AD (n = 27/177; 15%) and MCI (n = 74/217, 34%) were more likely to be APOE4-negative (MCI 83%, AD 96%) than their florbetapir+ counterparts (MCI 30%, AD 24%). Florbetapir- patients also had less AD-specific hypometabolism, lower CSF p-tau and t-tau, and better longitudinal cognitive performance, and were more likely to be taking medication for depression. In MCI only, florbetapir- participants had less hippocampal atrophy and hypometabolism and lower functional activity questionnaire scores compared to florbetapir+ participants. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, image analysis problems do not appear to be a primary explanation of amyloid negativity. Florbetapir- ADNI patients have a variety of clinical and biomarker features that differ from their florbetapir+ counterparts, suggesting that one or more non-AD etiologies (which may include vascular disease and depression) account for their AD-like phenotype.",

    "title": "Intrahippocampal administration of a domain antibody that binds aggregated amyloid-beta reverses cognitive deficits produced by diet-induced obesity.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of high fat diets (HFD), diet-induced obesity (DIO) and Type 2 diabetes continues to increase, associated with cognitive impairment in both humans and rodent models. Mechanisms transducing these impairments remain largely unknown: one possibility is that a common mechanism may be involved in the cognitive impairment seen in obese and/or diabetic states and in dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease (AD). DIO is well established as a risk factor for development of AD. Oligomeric amyloid-beta (Abeta) is neurotoxic, and we showed that intrahippocampal oligomeric Abeta produces cognitive and metabolic dysfunction similar to that seen in DIO or diabetes. Moreover, animal models of DIO show elevated brain Abeta, a hallmark of AD, suggesting that this may be one source of cognitive impairment in both conditions. METHODS: Intrahippocampal administration of a novel anti-Abeta domain antibody for aggregated Abeta, or a control domain antibody, to control or HFD-induced DIO rats. Spatial learning measured in a conditioned contextual fear (CCF) task after domain antibody treatment; postmortem, hippocampal NMDAR and AMPAR were measured. RESULTS: DIO caused impairment in CCF, and this impairment was eliminated by intrahippocampal administration of the active domain antibody. Measurement of hippocampal proteins suggests that DIO causes dysregulation of hippocampal AMPA receptors, which is also reversed by acute domain antibody administration. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the concept that oligomeric Abeta within the hippocampus of DIO animals may not only be a risk factor for development of AD but may also cause cognitive impairment before the development of dementia. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE AND INTEREST: Our work integrates the engineering of domain antibodies with conformational- and sequence-specificity for oligomeric amyloid beta with a clinically relevant model of diet-induced obesity in order to demonstrate not only the pervasive effects of obesity on several aspects of brain biochemistry and behavior, but also the bioengineering of a successful treatment against the long-term detrimental effects of a pre-diabetic state on the brain. We show for the first time that cognitive impairment linked to obesity and/or insulin resistance may be due to early accumulation of oligomeric beta-amyloid in the brain, and hence may represent a pre-Alzheimer's state.",

We show herein that these two modifications significantly reduce the fibril length and the transition midpoint of thermal unfolding of the fibrils, but they do not substantially perturb the fibrillary peptide conformation. This observation implies that the N terminus of the unmodified peptide protects Abeta fibrils against mechanical stress and fragmentation and explains the high propensity of pE-modified peptides to form small and particularly toxic aggregates.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress has been recognized as a contributing factor in ageing and various diseases including cancer and neuropathological disorders. Indole derivatives such as the neurohormone melatonin (MLT) constitute an important class of therapeutic agent in medicinal chemistry. MLT can scavenge different reactive oxygen species and can also stimulate the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes. As a part of our ongoing studies, a series of new indole-based hydrazide/hydrazone derivatives were synthesized as MLT analogues. Their antioxidant activity was investigated in human erythrocytes by evaluating their reducing effect against oxidation of a redox-sensitive fluorescent probe. Possible inherent cytotoxicity of the compounds was investigated in CHO-K1 cells by lactate dehydrogenase leakage test. Protection of neuronal PC12 cells against amyloid beta-induced damage was examined by MTT assay and their ability in reduction of ROS generation induced by amyloid beta was tested. MLT analogues having an o-halogenated aromatic moiety exhibited effective antioxidant properties without having any membrane-damaging effect. Moreover, derivatives having o-halogenated and dihalogenated aromatic side chain significantly protected neuronal cells at concentrations of 10 and 100 muM. In conclusion, MLT derivatives represent promising scaffolds for discovery of effective antioxidant and neuroprotective agents.",

    "abstract": "Transactivating responsive sequence (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43-kDa (TDP-43) pathology has been described in various brain diseases, but the full anatomical distribution and clinical and biological implications of that pathology are incompletely characterized. Here, we describe TDP-43 neuropathology in the basal forebrain, hypothalamus, and adjacent nuclei in 98 individuals (mean age, 86 years; median final mini-mental state examination score, 27). On examination blinded to clinical and pathologic diagnoses, we identified TDP-43 pathology that most frequently involved the ventromedial basal forebrain in 19 individuals (19.4%). As expected, many of these brains had comorbid pathologies including those of Alzheimer disease (AD), Lewy body disease (LBD), and/or hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging). The basal forebrain TDP-43 pathology was strongly associated with comorbid HS-Aging (odds ratio = 6.8, p = 0.001), whereas there was no significant association between basal forebrain TDP-43 pathology and either AD or LBD neuropathology. In this sample, there were some cases with apparent preclinical TDP-43 pathology in the basal forebrain that may indicate that this is an early affected area in HS-Aging. We conclude that TDP-43 pathology in the basal forebrain is strongly associated with HS-Aging. These results raise questions about a specific pathogenetic relationship between basal forebrain TDP-43 and non-HS-Aging comorbid diseases (AD and LBD).",

    "abstract": "Progressive accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) will form the senile plaques and cause oxidative damage and neuronal cell death, which was accepted as the major pathological mechanism to the Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, inhibition of Abeta-induced oxidative damage and neuronal cell apoptosis by agents with potential antioxidant properties represents one of the most effective strategies in combating human AD. Curcumin (Cur) a natural extraction from curcuma longa has potential of pharmacological efficacy, including the benefit to antagonize Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. However, the molecular mechanism remains elusive. The present study evaluated the protective effect of Cur against Abeta-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in PC12 cells and investigated the underlying mechanism. The results showed that Cur markedly reduced Abeta-induced cytotoxicity by inhibition of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis through regulation of Bcl-2 family. The PARP cleavage, caspases activation, and ROS-mediated DNA damage induced by Abeta were all significantly blocked by Cur. Moreover, regulation of p38 MAPK and AKT pathways both contributed to this protective potency. Our findings suggested that Cur could effectively suppress Abeta-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis by inhibition of ROS-mediated oxidative damage and regulation of ERK pathway, which validated its therapeutic potential in chemoprevention and chemotherapy of Abeta-induced neurotoxicity.",

A first-principles global minimum search based on replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) leads to a compact structure with strong interstrand interactions. We use REMD with a distance restraint that implements an adaptive effective bias upon average FRET-efficiencies and thus guides the sampling by the action-FRET measurement. This procedure leads to a pair of weakly interacting peptides. Ion-mobility confirms that the weakly interacting structure and not the global minimum with strongly interacting peptides is populated in the experiment. The presence of a high energy barrier between the two structural families, as evidenced from the MD data, suggests that a kinetically trapped structure is observed in the experiment.",

This study concerns the relationship between electromagnetic pulse (EMP) exposure and the occurrence of AD in rats and the underlying mechanisms, focusing on the role of oxidative stress (OS). 55 healthy male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were used and received continuous exposure for 8 months. Morris water maze (MWM) test was conducted to test the ability of cognitive and memory. The level of OS was detected by superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH) content. We found that long-term EMP exposure induced cognitive damage in rats. The content of beta-amyloid (Abeta) protein in hippocampus was increased after long-term EMP exposure. OS of hippocampal neuron was detected. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay showed that the content of Abeta protein and its oligomers in EMP-exposed rats were higher than that of sham-exposed rats. The content of Beta Site App Cleaving Enzyme (BACE1) and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II) in EMP-exposed rats hippocampus were also higher than that of sham-exposed rats. SOD activity and GSH content in EMP-exposed rats were lower than sham-exposed rats (p<0.05). Several mechanisms were proposed based on EMP exposure-induced OS, including increased amyloid precursor protein (APP) aberrant cleavage. Although further study is needed, the present results suggest that long-term EMP exposure is harmful to cognitive ability in rats and could induce AD-like pathological manifestation.",

    "abstract": "A series of novel multipotent 2-piperidone derivatives were designed, synthesized and biologically evaluated as chemical agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The results showed that most of the target compounds displayed significant potency to inhibit Abeta(1-42) self-aggregation. Among them, compound 7q exhibited the best inhibition of Abeta(1-42) self-aggregation (59.11% at 20 muM) in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, the compounds 6b, 7p and 7q as representatives were found to present anti-inflammation properties in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglial BV-2 cells. They could effectively suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6. Meanwhile, compound 7q could prevent the neuronal cell SH-SY5Y death by LPS-stimulated microglia cell activation mediated neurotoxicity. The molecular modeling studies demonstrated that compounds matched the pharmacophore well and had good predicted physicochemical properties and estimated IC50 values. Moreover, compound 7q exerted a good binding to the active site of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) through the docking analysis and could interfere with its homodimerization or heterodimerization. Consequently, these compounds emerged as promising candidates for further development of novel multifunctional agents for AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Evidence accumulates suggesting a complex interplay between neurodegenerative processes and serotonergic neurotransmission. We have previously reported an overexpression of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors (5-HT(1A)R) after intrahippocampal injections of amyloid-beta 1-40 (Abeta40) fibrils in rats. This serotonergic reactivity paralleled results from clinical positron emission tomography studies with [(18)F]MPPF revealing an overexpression of 5-HT(1A)R in the hippocampus of patients with mild cognitive impairment. Because Abeta40 and Abeta42 isoforms are found in amyloid plaques, we tested in this study the hypothesis of a peptide- and region-specific 5-HT(1A)R reactivity by injecting them, separately, into the hippocampus or striatum of rats. [(18)F]MPPF in vitro autoradiography revealed that Abeta40 fibrils, but not Abeta42, were triggering an overexpression of 5-HT(1A)R in the hippocampus and striatum of rat brains after 7 days. Immunohistochemical approaches targeting neuronal precursor cells, mature neurons, and astrocytes showed that Abeta42 fibrils caused more pathophysiological damages than Abeta40 fibrils. The mechanisms of Abeta40 fibrils-induced 5-HT(1A)R expression remains unknown, but hypotheses including neurogenesis, glial expression, and axonal sprouting are discussed.",

    "abstract": "APP/PS1 double transgenic mice expressing human mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PS1) demonstrate robust brain amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide containing plaque deposition, increased markers of oxidative stress, behavioral dysfunction, and proinflammatory gliosis. On the other hand, lack of growth hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone due to a recessive mutation in the Prop 1 gene (Prop1df) in Ames dwarf mice results in a phenotype characterized by potentiated antioxidant mechanisms, improved learning and memory, and significantly increased longevity in homozygous mice. Based on this, we hypothesized that a similar hormone deficiency might attenuate disease changes in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. To test this idea, APP/PS1 mice were crossed to the Ames dwarf mouse line. APP/PS1, wild-type, df/+, df/df, df/+/APP/PS1, and df/df/APP/PS1 mice were compared at 6 months of age through behavioral testing and assessing amyloid burden, reactive gliosis, and brain cytokine levels. df/df mice demonstrated lower brain growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 concentrations. This correlated with decreased astrogliosis and microgliosis in the df/df/APP/PS1 mice and, surprisingly, reduced Abeta plaque deposition and Abeta 1-40 and Abeta 1-42 concentrations. The df/df/APP/PS1 mice also demonstrated significantly elevated brain levels of multiple cytokines in spite of the attenuated gliosis. These data indicate that the df/df/APP/PS1 line is a unique resource in which to study aging and resistance to disease and suggest that the affected pituitary hormones may have a role in regulating disease progression.",

This study tested whether brain amyloid-beta deposition, measured in vivo with (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB), was associated with parental dementia and/or younger parental AO. Detailed FH and positron emission tomography (PiB) data were acquired in 147 nondemented aging individuals (mean age 75 +- 8). No participant had both positive maternal and paternal FH. A series of analyses revealed that those with maternal, but not paternal, FH had greater levels of PiB retention in a global cortical region than those without FH. PiB retention in maternal FH was not significantly greater than paternal FH. Younger maternal dementia AO was related to greater PiB retention in offspring, whereas younger paternal dementia AO was not. Overall, results suggest that not only is amyloid-beta burden greater in individuals with maternal FH, but also that the burden is greater in association with younger maternal AO.",

    "abstract": "We assessed the prevalence of common altered brain proteins in 296 cognitively unimpaired subjects ranging from age 50 to 102 years. The incidence and the stage of hyperphosphorylated-tau (HPtau), beta-amyloid, alpha-synuclein (alphaS), and transactive response DNA (TDP) binding protein 43 (TDP43)-immunoreactivity (-IR) increased with age. HPtau-IR was observed in 98% of the subjects; the locus coeruleus was solely affected in 46%, and 79% of the subjects were in Braak stages a to II. beta-Amyloid was seen in 47% of subjects and the Thal phase correlated with the HPtau Braak stage and age. Intermediate Alzheimer disease-related pathology (ADRP) was seen in 12%; 52% of the subjects with HPtau-IR fulfilled criteria for definite primary age-related tauopathy (PART). The incidence of concomitant pathology (alphaS, TDP43) did not differ between those with PART and those with ADRP but the former were younger. TDP43-IR was observed in 36%; the most frequently affected region was the medulla; alphaS-IR was observed in 19% of subjects. In 41% of the subjects from 80 to 89 years at death, 3 altered proteins were seen in the brain. Thus, altered proteins are common in the brains of cognitively unimpaired aged subjects; this should be considered while developing diagnostic biomarkers, particularly for identifying subjects at early stages of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Herein, we report that the inhibition effect of a pristine peptide motif (KLVFF) can be significantly improved by introducing a terminal regulatory moiety (terpyridine). The molecular-level observations by using scanning tunneling microscopy reveal stoichiometry-dependent polymorphism of the coassembly structures, which originates from the terminal interactions of peptide with organic modulator moieties and can be attributed to the secondary structures of peptides and conformations of the organic molecules. Furthermore, the polymorphism of the peptide-organic coassemblies is shown to be correlated to distinctively different inhibition effects on amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42) aggregations and cytotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "The intracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers critically contributes to disease progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and can be the potential target of AD therapy. Direct observation of molecular dynamics of Abeta oligomers in vivo is key for drug discovery research, however, it has been challenging because Abeta aggregation inhibits the fluorescence from fusion proteins. Here, we developed Abeta1-42-GFP fusion proteins that are oligomerized and visualize their dynamics inside cells even when aggregated. We examined the aggregation states of Abeta-GFP fusion proteins using several methods and confirmed that they did not assemble into fibrils, but instead formed oligomers in vitro and in live cells. By arranging the length of the liker between Abeta and GFP, we generated two fusion proteins with \"a long-linker\" and \"a short-linker\", and revealed that the aggregation property of fusion proteins can be evaluated by measuring fluorescence intensities using rat primary culture neurons transfected with Abeta-GFP plasmids and Abeta-GFP transgenic C. elegans. We found that Abeta-GFP fusion proteins induced cell death in COS7 cells. These results suggested that novel Abeta-GFP fusion proteins could be utilized for studying the physiological functions of Abeta oligomers in living cells and animals, and for drug screening by analyzing Abeta toxicity.",

    "title": "Memory retrieval by activating engram cells in mouse models of early Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory decline and subsequent loss of broader cognitive functions. Memory decline in the early stages of AD is mostly limited to episodic memory, for which the hippocampus has a crucial role. However, it has been uncertain whether the observed amnesia in the early stages of AD is due to disrupted encoding and consolidation of episodic information, or an impairment in the retrieval of stored memory information. Here we show that in transgenic mouse models of early AD, direct optogenetic activation of hippocampal memory engram cells results in memory retrieval despite the fact that these mice are amnesic in long-term memory tests when natural recall cues are used, revealing a retrieval, rather than a storage impairment. Before amyloid plaque deposition, the amnesia in these mice is age-dependent, which correlates with a progressive reduction in spine density of hippocampal dentate gyrus engram cells. We show that optogenetic induction of long-term potentiation at perforant path synapses of dentate gyrus engram cells restores both spine density and long-term memory. We also demonstrate that an ablation of dentate gyrus engram cells containing restored spine density prevents the rescue of long-term memory. Thus, selective rescue of spine density in engram cells may lead to an effective strategy for treating memory loss in the early stages of AD.",

    "abstract": "While emerging evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease, the impact of the microglia response in Alzheimer's disease remains a matter of debate. We aimed to study microglial activation in early Alzheimer's disease and its impact on clinical progression using a second-generation 18-kDa translocator protein positron emission tomography radiotracer together with amyloid imaging using Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography. We enrolled 96 subjects, 64 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 32 controls, from the IMABio3 study, who had both (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B and (18)F-DPA-714 positron emission tomography imaging. Patients with Alzheimer's disease were classified as prodromal Alzheimer's disease (n = 38) and Alzheimer's disease dementia (n = 26). Translocator protein-binding was measured using a simple ratio method with cerebellar grey matter as reference tissue, taking into account regional atrophy. Images were analysed at the regional (volume of interest) and at the voxel level. Translocator protein genotyping allowed the classification of all subjects in high, mixed and low affinity binders. Thirty high+mixed affinity binders patients with Alzheimer's disease were dichotomized into slow decliners (n = 10) or fast decliners (n = 20) after 2 years of follow-up. All patients with Alzheimer's disease had an amyloid positive Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography. Among controls, eight had positive amyloid scans (n = 6 high+mixed affinity binders), defined as amyloidosis controls, and were analysed separately. By both volumes of interest and voxel-wise comparison, 18-kDa translocator protein-binding was higher in high affinity binders, mixed affinity binders and high+mixed affinity binders Alzheimer's disease groups compared to controls, especially at the prodromal stage, involving the temporo-parietal cortex. Translocator protein-binding was positively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination scores and grey matter volume, as well as with Pittsburgh compound B binding. Amyloidosis controls displayed higher translocator protein-binding than controls, especially in the frontal cortex. We found higher translocator protein-binding in slow decliners than fast decliners, with no difference in Pittsburgh compound B binding. Microglial activation appears at the prodromal and possibly at the preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease, and seems to play a protective role in the clinical progression of the disease at these early stages. The extent of microglial activation appears to differ between patients, and could explain the overlap in translocator protein binding values between patients with Alzheimer's disease and amyloidosis controls.",

    "abstract": "As stated by the prevailing amyloid cascade hypothesis, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by the aggregation and cerebral deposition of long amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) species, which are released from a C-terminal amyloid precursor protein fragment by gamma-secretase. Mutations in its catalytic subunit presenilin-1 (PS1) increase the Abeta42 to Abeta40 ratio and are the major cause of familial AD (FAD). An opposing hypothesis states that loss of essential presenilin functions underlies the disease. A major argument for this hypothesis is the observation that the nearly inactive PS1 L435F mutant, paradoxically, causes FAD We now show that the very little Abeta generated by PS1 L435F consists primarily of Abeta43, a highly amyloidogenic species which was overlooked in previous studies of this mutant. We further demonstrate that the generation of Abeta43 is not due to a trans-dominant effect of this mutant on WT presenilin. Furthermore, we found Abeta43-containing plaques in brains of patients with this mutation. The aberrant generation of Abeta43 by this particular mutant provides a direct objection against the presenilin hypothesis.",

With the goal of synthesising charge neutral, low molecular weight, lipophilic gallium complexes with the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier and bind to Abeta plaques we have used an ancillary tetradentate N2O2 Schiff base ligand and the beta-diketone curcumin as a bidentate ligand to give a six-coordinate Ga3+ complex. The tetradentate Schiff base ligand adopts the cis-beta configuration with deprotonated curcumin acting as a bidentate ligand. The complex binds to amyloid-beta plaques in human brain tissue and it is possible that extension of this chemistry to positron-emitting gallium-68 could provide useful imaging agents for Alzheimer's disease.",

Even if pathogenic spread is proven in humans, it is unclear how much this would alter the specific therapeutic approaches that are in development.

    "title": "The involvement of protein kinase G inhibitor in regulation of apoptosis and autophagy markers in spatial memory deficit induced by Abeta.",
    "abstract": "The role of nitric oxide/protein kinase G (NO/PKG) in neurodegenerative disorders is controversial in different circumstances. PKG affects neurons both by itself and as a result of increased NO concentration. In this study, we examined the influence of PKG on spatial memory by intrahippocampal administration of three different concentrations of KT5823 as a PKG inhibitor. Morris water maze (MWM) was used for evaluation of behavioral alterations. We also measured the apoptosis and autophagy markers as two probable interfering pathways with PKG signaling by Western blot method. We found that in Abeta-pretreated rats, intrahippocampus infusions of 2.5, 5, and 10 mum/side of KT5823 led to a significant reduction in escape latency and traveled distance comparing to Abeta-treatment group. Our molecular findings indicated that KT5823 could induce autophagy and attenuate apoptotic markers at distinct doses. Here, we can conclude that in addition to other parameters, apoptosis, and autophagy in part have damaging and protective roles, respectively, in PKG signaling mechanisms. As autophagy-related proteins lose their functions in neurodegenerative diseases, we can suggest that autophagy can be one of the therapeutic aims for remedy of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "The neurotrophin receptor p75 (p75NTR) is a receptor for amyloid-beta (Abeta) and mediates Abeta-induced neurodegenerative signals. The ectodomain of p75NTR (p75ECD) is a physiological protective factor against Abeta in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously demonstrated that the shedding of p75ECD from the cell surface is down-regulated in AD brains and restoration of the p75ECD level in the brain, through intracranial administration of p75ECD by adeno-associated virus vectors, attenuates AD-like pathologies in an AD mouse model. In this study, we further investigated the feasibility and efficacy of peripheral administration of AAV-p75ECD on brain amyloid burden and associated pathogenesis. We found that intramuscular delivery of AAV-p75ECD increased the level of p75ECD in the blood, significantly improved the behavioral phenotype of amyloid precursor protein/PS1 transgenic mice, and reduced brain amyloid burden, attenuated Tau hyperphosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, intramuscular delivery of AAV-p75ECD was well tolerated. Our results indicate that peripheral delivery of p75ECD represents a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for AD.

Given that Abeta peptides are known to localise within mitochondria and interact with 17beta-HSD10, a mitochondrial protein expressed at high levels in AD brains, we investigated the inhibitory potential of 17beta-HSD10 against Abeta aggregation under a range of physiological conditions. Fluorescence self-quenching (FSQ) of Abeta(1-42) labelled with HiLyte Fluor 555 was used to evaluate the inhibitory effect under conditions established to grow distinct Abeta morphologies. 17beta-HSD10 preferentially inhibits the formation of globular and fibrillar-like structures but has no effect on the growth of amorphous plaque-like aggregates at endosomal pH 6.

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) share specific molecular mechanisms, and agents with proven efficacy in one may be useful against the other. The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist exendin-4 has similar properties to GLP-1 and is currently in clinical use for T2DM treatment. Thus, this study was designed to characterize the effects of exendin-4 on the impairment of learning and memory induced by amyloid protein (Abeta) and its probable molecular underlying mechanisms. The results showed that (1) intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of Abeta1-42 resulted in a significant decline of spatial learning and memory of rats in water maze tests; (2) pretreatment with exendin-4 effectively and dose-dependently protected against the Abeta1-42-induced impairment of spatial learning and memory; (3) exendin-4 treatment significantly decreased the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3 and increased the expression of Bcl2 in Abeta1-42-induced Alzheimer's rats. The vision and swimming speed of the rats among all groups in the visible platform tests did not show any difference. These findings indicate that systemic pretreatment with exendin-4 can effectively prevent the behavioral impairment induced by neurotoxic Abeta1-42, and the underlying protective mechanism of exendin-4 may be involved in the Bcl2, Bax and caspase-3 pathways. Thus, the application of exendin-4 or the activation of its signaling pathways may be a promising strategy to ameliorate the degenerative processes observed in AD.",

    "title": "Presynaptic dystrophic neurites surrounding amyloid plaques are sites of microtubule disruption, BACE1 elevation, and increased Abeta generation in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid plaques composed of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide surrounded by swollen presynaptic dystrophic neurites consisting of dysfunctional axons and terminals that accumulate the beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme (BACE1) required for Abeta generation. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern presynaptic dystrophic neurite formation are unclear, and elucidating these processes may lead to novel AD therapeutic strategies. Previous studies suggest Abeta may disrupt microtubules, which we hypothesize have a critical role in the development of presynaptic dystrophies. To investigate this further, here we have assessed the effects of Abeta, particularly neurotoxic Abeta42, on microtubules during the formation of presynaptic dystrophic neurites in vitro and in vivo. Live-cell imaging of primary neurons revealed that exposure to Abeta42 oligomers caused varicose and beaded neurites with extensive microtubule disruption, and inhibited anterograde and retrograde trafficking. In brain sections from AD patients and the 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of amyloid pathology, dystrophic neurite halos with BACE1 elevation around amyloid plaques exhibited aberrant tubulin accumulations or voids. At the ultrastructural level, peri-plaque dystrophies were strikingly devoid of microtubules and replete with multi-lamellar vesicles resembling autophagic intermediates. Proteins of the microtubule motors, kinesin and dynein, and other neuronal proteins were aberrantly localized in peri-plaque dystrophies. Inactive pro-cathepsin D also accumulated in peri-plaque dystrophies, indicating reduced lysosomal function. Most importantly, BACE1 accumulation in peri-plaque dystrophies caused increased BACE1 cleavage of APP and Abeta generation. Our study supports the hypothesis that Abeta induces microtubule disruption in presynaptic dystrophic neurites that surround plaques, thus impairing axonal transport and leading to accumulation of BACE1 and exacerbation of amyloid pathology in AD.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The genetics underlying posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), typically a rare variant of Alzheimer's disease (AD), remain uncertain. METHODS: We genotyped 302 PCA patients from 11 centers, calculated risk at 24 loci for AD/DLB and performed an exploratory genome-wide association study. RESULTS: We confirm that variation in/near APOE/TOMM40 (P = 6 x 10(-14)) alters PCA risk, but with smaller effect than for typical AD (PCA: odds ratio [OR] = 2.03, typical AD: OR = 2.83, P = .0007). We found evidence for risk in/near CR1 (P = 7 x 10(-4)), ABCA7 (P = .02) and BIN1 (P = .04). ORs at variants near INPP5D and NME8 did not overlap between PCA and typical AD. Exploratory genome-wide association studies confirmed APOE and identified three novel loci: rs76854344 near CNTNAP5 (P = 8 x 10(-10) OR = 1.9 [1.5-2.3]); rs72907046 near FAM46A (P = 1 x 10(-9) OR = 3.2 [2.1-4.9]); and rs2525776 near SEMA3C (P = 1 x 10(-8), OR = 3.3 [2.1-5.1]). DISCUSSION: We provide evidence for genetic risk factors specifically related to PCA. We identify three candidate loci that, if replicated, may provide insights into selective vulnerability and phenotypic diversity in AD.",

    "abstract": "New strategies for visualizing self-assembly processes at the nanoscale give deep insights into the molecular origins of disease. An example is the self-assembly of misfolded proteins into amyloid fibrils, which is related to a range of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Here, we probe the links between the mechanism of alpha-synuclein (AS) aggregation and its associated toxicity by using optical nanoscopy directly in a neuronal cell culture model of Parkinson's disease. Using superresolution microscopy, we show that protein fibrils are taken up by neuronal cells and act as prion-like seeds for elongation reactions that both consume endogenous AS and suppress its de novo aggregation. When AS is internalized in its monomeric form, however, it nucleates and triggers the aggregation of endogenous AS, leading to apoptosis, although there are no detectable cross-reactions between externally added and endogenous protein species. Monomer-induced apoptosis can be reduced by pretreatment with seed fibrils, suggesting that partial consumption of the externally added or excess soluble AS can be significantly neuroprotective.",

Abeta binding to CypD (cyclophilin D) induces dysfunction of human mitochondria.

The prototypic inhibitor CsA (cyclosporin A) of both cyclophilins as well as the new water-soluble MM258 derivative prevented this suppression. A SPOT peptide array approach and NMR titration experiments confirmed binding of Abeta(1-40) to the catalytic site of CypD mainly via residues Lys(16)-Glu(22) The peptide Abeta(16-20) representing this section showed submicromolar IC50 values for the peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of CypD and CypA and low-micromolar KD values in ITC experiments. Chemical cross-linking and NMR-detected hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments revealed a shift in the populations of small Abeta(1-40) oligomers towards the monomeric species, which we investigated in the present study as being the main process of prevention of Abeta fibril formation by cyclophilins.",

Among the existing imaging methods, optical imaging targeting Abeta aggregates (fibrils or oligomers), especially using near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes, is increasingly recognized as a promising approach for the early diagnosis of AD due to its real time detection, low cost, lack of radioactive exposure and high-resolution. In the past decade, a variety of fluorescent probes have been developed and tested for efficiency in vitro, and several probes have shown efficacy in AD transgenic mice. This review classifies these representative probes based on their chemical structures and functional modes (dominant solvent-dependent mode and a novel solvent-independent mode). Moreover, the pharmaceutical characteristics of these representative probes are summarized and discussed. This review provides important perspectives for the future development of novel NIR Abeta diagnostic probes.",

Limitations in monitoring the aggregation of Abeta in cells and tissues restrict the screening of anti-amyloid drugs to in vitro studies in most cases. We have developed a simple but powerful method to track Abeta aggregation in vivo in real-time, using bacteria as in vivo amyloid reservoir. We use the specific amyloid dye Thioflavin-S (Th-S) to stain bacterial inclusion bodies (IBs), in this case mainly formed of Abeta in amyloid conformation. Th-S binding to amyloids leads to an increment of fluorescence that can be monitored. The quantification of the Th-S fluorescence along the time allows tracking Abeta aggregation and the effect of potential anti-aggregating agents.",

    "abstract": "Exercise is becoming a promising therapeutic approach to prevent alterations both in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and in transgenic models of AD. This neuroprotection has been associated with changes in hippocampal structure and function, as well as with the reduction of amyloid-beta (Abeta) production and accumulation. However, whether exercise produces lasting changes in hippocampal population activity and renders it resistant to Abeta-induced network dysfunction is still unknown. Thus, we tested whether voluntary exercise changes hippocampal population activity and prevents its alteration in the presence of Abeta, which has been associated to glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) activation. We found that the hippocampal population activity recorded in slices obtained from mice that exercised voluntarily (with free access to a running wheel for 21 days) exhibits higher power and faster frequency composition than slices obtained from sedentary animals. Moreover, the hippocampal network of mice that exercised becomes insensitive to Abeta-induced inhibition of spontaneous population activity. This protective effect correlates with the inability of Abeta to activate GSK3beta, is mimicked by GSK3beta inhibition with SB126763 (in slices obtained from sedentary mice), and is abolished by the inhibition of PI3K with LY294002 (in slices obtained from mice that exercised). We conclude that voluntary exercise produces a lasting protective state in the hippocampus, maintained in hippocampal slices by a PI3K-dependent mechanism that precludes its functional disruption in the presence of Abeta by avoiding GSK3beta activation.",

Using tagger methods, we extracted 15 targeted ABCA7 loci to investigate their associations with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging markers in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Finally, although we did not detect any significant associations of previously published GWAS SNPs (rs3764650 and rs78117248) with all the CSF (Abeta1 - 42, T-tau, and P-tau) and neuroimaging markers, three other variants (rs3752242, rs3752240, and rs4147912) at ABCA7 loci were detected to show significant associations with amyloid deposition on AV-45 PET in brain. Moreover, haplotype and subgroup analysis confirmed these significant findings. Furthermore, there were no remarkable correlations between ABCA7 variants and neuronal degeneration biomarkers (elevated CSF tau, brain structure atrophy, and hypometabolism on imaging) in this study. Thus, our study suggested that ABCA7 genotypes contribute to the AD risk through involvement in amyloid-beta deposition on in vivo imaging, but not in tau pathology, brain atrophy, or decreased glucose metabolism.",

METHODS: Multivariate mixed models for repeated measures were used to assess the correlations on the rates of changes across markers. RESULTS: Among 209 asymptomatic middle-aged to older individuals longitudinally followed for up to 11 years (mean 6.7 years), a faster intraindividual decrease in CSF Abeta42 was associated with a faster increase in PiB mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio (MCSUVR, p = 0.04), but not others. The rate of change in CSF tau (and Ptau181) was correlated with the rate of change in PiB MCSUVR (p = 0.002), hippocampal volume (p = 0.04), and global cognition (p = 0.008). The rate of change in hippocampal volume was correlated with the rate of change in global cognition (p = 0.04). Only 3 significant correlations were observed at baseline: CSF Abeta42 and PiB MCSUVR (p < 0.001), CSF tau and PiB MCSUVR (p < 0.001), and CSF Abeta42 and global cognition (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: CSF tau (Ptau181), PiB MCSUVR, and hippocampal volume were all longitudinally correlated with each other, whereas CSF Abeta42 was correlated only with PiB binding. Unlike the baseline values, the longitudinal change in CSF tau (Ptau181) and hippocampal volume were correlated with the longitudinal change in global cognition, validating the role of these biomarkers in Alzheimer disease prevention trials.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Development of new therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly focused on more mildly affected populations, and requires new assessment and outcome strategies. Patients in early stages of AD have mild cognitive decline and no, or limited, functional impairment. To respond to these assessment challenges, we developed a measurement approach based on established scale items that exhibited change in previous amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) trials. METHODS: Partial least squares regression with a longitudinal clinical decline model identified items from commonly used clinical scales with the highest combined sensitivity to change over time in aMCI and weighted these items according to their relative contribution to detecting clinical progression in patients' early stages of AD. The resultant AD Composite Score (ADCOMS) was assessed for its ability to detect treatment effect in aMCI/prodromal AD (pAD) clinical trial populations. RESULTS: ADCOMS consists of 4 Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale items, 2 Mini-Mental State Examination items, and all 6 Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes items. ADCOMS demonstrated improved sensitivity to clinical decline over individual scales in pAD, aMCI and in mild AD dementia. ADCOMS also detected treatment effects associated with the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in these populations. Improved sensitivity predicts smaller sample size requirements when ADCOMS is used in early AD trials. CONCLUSIONS: ADCOMS is proposed as new standard outcome for pAD and mild AD dementia trials, and is progressing in a CAMD-sponsored qualification process for use in registration trials of pAD.",

    "title": "Peptides Composed of Alternating L- and D-Amino Acids Inhibit Amyloidogenesis in Three Distinct Amyloid Systems Independent of Sequence.",
    "abstract": "There is now substantial evidence that soluble oligomers are primary toxic agents in amyloid diseases. The development of an antibody recognizing the toxic soluble oligomeric forms of different and unrelated amyloid species suggests a common conformational intermediate during amyloidogenesis. We previously observed a common occurrence of a novel secondary structure element, which we call alpha-sheet, in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of various amyloidogenic proteins, and we hypothesized that the toxic conformer is composed of alpha-sheet structure. As such, alpha-sheet may represent a conformational signature of the misfolded intermediates of amyloidogenesis and a potential unique binding target for peptide inhibitors. Recently, we reported the design and characterization of a novel hairpin peptide (alpha1 or AP90) that adopts stable alpha-sheet structure and inhibits the aggregation of the beta-Amyloid Peptide Abeta42 and transthyretin. AP90 is a 23-residue hairpin peptide featuring alternating D- and L-amino acids with favorable conformational propensities for alpha-sheet formation, and a designed turn. For this study, we reverse engineered AP90 to identify which of its design features is most responsible for conferring alpha-sheet stability and inhibitory activity. We present experimental characterization (CD and FTIR) of seven peptides designed to accomplish this. In addition, we measured their ability to inhibit aggregation in three unrelated amyloid species: Abeta42, transthyretin, and human islet amylin polypeptide. We found that a hairpin peptide featuring alternating L- and D-amino acids, independent of sequence, is sufficient for conferring alpha-sheet structure and inhibition of aggregation. Additionally, we show a correlation between alpha-sheet structural stability and inhibitory activity.",

    "title": "Conformational Dynamics of Specific Abeta Oligomers Govern Their Ability To Replicate and Induce Neuronal Apoptosis.",
    "abstract": "Oligomers of amyloid-beta (Abeta) have emerged as the primary toxic agents responsible for early synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Characterization of oligomers is an important step in the progress toward delineating the complex molecular mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis. In our previous reports, we established that a distinct 12-24mer neurotoxic oligomer of Abeta42, called Large Fatty Acid derived Oligomers (LFAOs), exhibits a unique property of replication in which LFAOs directly duplicate to quantitatively larger amounts upon interacting with monomers. This self-propagative process of replication is somewhat reminiscent of prion propagation. In this report, we sought to investigate the concentration-dependent conformational dynamics LFAOs undergo and how such transitions manifest in their ability to replicate and induce neuronal apoptosis. The results indicate that LFAOs undergo a concentration-dependent transition between 12mers and disperse 12-24mers with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.1 muM. The two species differ in their respective tertiary/quaternary structures but not their secondary structures. This conformational dynamics of LFAOs correlates with their ability to replicate and to induce apoptosis in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, with 12mers being more neurotoxic and prone to replication than 12-24mers. The latter result implicates the replication process dominates at low physiological concentrations. The observations made in this report may have profound significance in deciphering the elusive roles of Abeta oligomer phenotypes and in determining their prion-type behavior in AD pathology.",

Recent observations of Abeta deposition in iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (iCJD) after dural grafting or treatment with pituitary extracts raised concerns whether Abeta is capable of transmitting disease as seen in prion diseases by the disease-associated prion protein. To address this issue, we re-sampled and re-evaluated archival material, including the grafted dura mater of two cases with iCJD (28 and 33-years-old) without mutations in the AbetaPP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes, and carrying epsilon3/epsilon3 alleles of the APOE gene. In addition, we evaluated 84 dura mater samples obtained at autopsy (mean age 84.9 +- 0.3) in the community-based VITA study for the presence of Abeta deposition. We show that the dura mater may harbor Abeta deposits (13 %) in the form of cerebral amyloid angiopathy or amorphous aggregates. In both iCJD cases, the grafted dura mater had accumulated Abeta. The morphology and distribution pattern of cerebral Abeta deposition together with the lack of tau pathology distinguishes the Abeta proteinopathy in iCJD from AD, from that seen in young individuals without cognitive decline carrying one or two APOE4 alleles, and from that related to traumatic brain injury. Our novel findings of Abeta deposits in the dura mater, including the grafted dura, and the distinct cerebral Abeta distribution in iCJD support the seeding properties of Abeta. However, in contrast to prion diseases, our study suggests that such Abeta seeding is unable to reproduce the full clinicopathological phenotype of AD.",

Two pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), Tau hyperphosphorylation and beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation, were examined. SD rats were exposed to PFOS during only prenatal and/or postnatal period. Tau mRNA and protein levels were elevated by PFOS exposure. The phosphorylation of Tau at S199, T231 and S396 sites were also increased. Besides, PFOS exposure increased the Abeta1-42 levels, as well as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) regulation. The prenatal PFOS exposure caused alterations in the involved proteins at comparable levels with the postnatal and both prenatal and postnatal exposure. Thus, it has raised some evidence that early PFOS exposure can affect processes linked to neurodegeneration, enhancing the AD pathological risk. And PFOS exposures in early life may be of particular etiologic importance of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible brain disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neurodegeneration of brain regions that are crucial for learning and memory. Although intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular senile plaques, composed of insoluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, have been the hallmarks of postmortem AD brains, memory impairment in early AD correlates better with pathological accumulation of soluble Abeta oligomers and persistent weakening of excitatory synaptic strength, which is demonstrated by inhibition of long-term potentiation, enhancement of long-term depression, and loss of synapses. However, current, approved interventions aiming to reduce Abeta levels have failed to retard disease progression; this has led to a pressing need to identify and target alternative pathogenic mechanisms of AD. Recently, it has been suggested that the disruption of Hebbian synaptic plasticity in AD is due to aberrant metaplasticity, which is a form of homeostatic plasticity that tunes the magnitude and direction of future synaptic plasticity based on previous neuronal or synaptic activity. This review examines emerging evidence for aberrant metaplasticity in AD. Putative mechanisms underlying aberrant metaplasticity in AD will also be discussed. We hope this review inspires future studies to test the extent to which these mechanisms contribute to the etiology of AD and offer therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Neurotoxic plaques composed of 39 to 42 residue-long amyloid beta peptides (Abetas) are copiously present in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Erythrosine B (ER), a xanthene food dye, inhibits the formation of Abeta fibrils and Abeta-associated cytotoxicity in vitro. Here, in an attempt to elucidate the inhibition mechanism, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to demonstrate the conformational change of Abeta40 induced by ER molecules in atomistic detail. During the simulation, the ER bound to the surfaces of both N-terminus and C-terminus regions of Abeta40. Our result shows that ER interacts with the aromatic side chains at the N-terminus region resulting in destabilization of the inter-chain stacking of Abeta40. Moreover, the stablility of the helical structures at the residues from 13 to 16 suggests that ER disturbs conformational transition of Abeta40. At the C-terminus region, the bound ER blocks water molecules and stabilizes the alpha-helical structure. Regardless of the number of ER molecules used, the interruption of the formation of the salt-bridge between aspartic acid 23 and lysine 28 occurred. To further validate our analysis, binding free energies of ER at each binding site were evaluated. The finding of stronger binding energy at the N-terminus region supports an inhibition mechanism induced by stacking interaction between ER and phenylalanine. These findings could aid present and future treatment studies for AD by clarifying the inhibition mechanism of ER on the conformational transition of Abeta40 at the molecular level.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to test the interaction between amyloid-beta and tau proteins as a determinant of metabolic decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). We assessed 120 cognitively normal individuals with [18F]florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements at baseline, as well as [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) PET at baseline and at 24 months. A voxel-based interaction model was built to test the associations between continuous measurements of CSF biomarkers, [18F]florbetapir and [18F]FDG standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR). We found that the synergistic interaction between [18F]florbetapir SUVR and CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) measurements, rather than the sum of their independent effects, was associated with a 24-month metabolic decline in basal and mesial temporal, orbitofrontal, and anterior and posterior cingulate cortices (P<0.001). In contrast, interactions using CSF amyloid-beta1-42 and total tau biomarkers did not associate with metabolic decline over a time frame of 24 months. The interaction found in this study further support the framework that amyloid-beta and hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates synergistically interact to cause downstream AD neurodegeneration. In fact, the regions displaying the metabolic decline reported here were confined to brain networks affected early by amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Preventive clinical trials may benefit from using a combination of amyloid-beta PET and p-tau biomarkers to enrich study populations of cognitively normal subjects with a high probability of disease progression in studies, using [18F]FDG as a biomarker of efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The lack of strong association between brain beta-amyloid deposition and cognitive impairment has been a challenge for the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field. Although beta-amyloid is necessary for the pathologic diagnosis of AD, it is not sufficient to make the pathologic diagnosis or cause dementia. We sought to identify the genetic modifiers of the relation between cortical beta-amyloid burden (measured using [18F]Florbetapir-PET) and cognitive dysfunction (measured using ADAS-cog) by conducting a genome-wide interaction study on baseline data from participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) phases GO/2 (n=678). Near genome-wide significant interaction effect was observed for rs73069071 within the IAPP (amylin) and SLCO1A2 genes (P=6.2 x 10-8). Congruent results were found using data from participants followed up from ADNI-1 (Pone-tailed=0.028, n=165). Meta-analysis across ADNI-GO/2 and ADNI-1 revealed a genome-wide significant interaction effect (P=1.1 x 10-8). Our results were further supported by similar interaction effects on temporal lobe cortical thickness (whole-brain voxelwise analysis: familywise error corrected P=0.013) and longitudinal changes in ADAS-cog score and left middle temporal thickness and amygdalar volume (Pone-tailed=0.026, 0.019 and 0.003, respectively). Using postmortem beta-amyloid immunohistochemistry data from 243 AD participants in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project, we also observed similar rs73069071-by-beta-amyloid deposition interaction effect on global cognitive function (Pone-tailed=0.005). Our findings provide insight into the complexity of the relationship between beta-amyloid burden and AD-related cognitive impairment. Although functional studies are required to elucidate the role of rs73069071 in AD pathophysiology, our results support the recently growing evidence on the role of amylin in AD.",

    "abstract": "Cholinesterases and amyloid beta are one of the major biological targets in the search for a new and efficacious treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The study describes synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of new compounds designed as dual binding site acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Among the synthesized compounds, two deserve special attention--compounds 42 and 13. The former is a saccharin derivative and the most potent and selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (EeAChE IC50 = 70 nM). Isoindoline-1,3-dione derivative 13 displays balanced inhibitory potency against acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) (EeAChE IC50 = 0.76 muM, EqBuChE IC50 = 0.618 muM), and it inhibits amyloid beta aggregation (35.8% at 10 muM). Kinetic studies show that the developed compounds act as mixed or non-competitive acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. According to molecular modelling studies, they are able to interact with both catalytic and peripheral active sites of the acetylcholinesterase. Their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was confirmed in vitro in the parallel artificial membrane permeability BBB assay. These compounds can be used as a solid starting point for further development of novel multifunctional ligands as potential anti-Alzheimer's agents.",

    "abstract": "We aim to evaluate the protective role of the central angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril, compared with the standard reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger tempol, against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cognition impairment and amyloidogenesis in a simulation to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mice were allocated into a control group, an LPS control group (0.8 mg/kg, i.p., once), a tempol (100 mg/kg/day, p.o., 7 days) treatment group, and two perindopril (0.5 and 1 mg/kg/day, p.o., 7 days) treatment groups. A behavioral study was conducted to evaluate spatial and nonspatial memory in mice, followed by a biochemical study involving assessment of brain levels of Abeta and BDNF as Alzheimer and neuroplasticity markers; tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), nitric oxide end-products (NOx), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) as inflammatory markers; and superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione reduced (GSH), and nitrotyrosine (NT) as oxido-nitrosative stress markers. Finally, histopathological examination of cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum sections was performed using both routine and special staining. Tempol and perindopril improved spatial and nonspatial memory in mice without affecting locomotor activity; decreased brain Abeta deposition and BDNF depletion; decreased brain TNF-alpha, NOx, nNOS, iNOS, MDA, and NT levels; and increased brain SOD and GSH contents, parallel to confirmatory histopathological findings. Tempol and perindopril may be promising agents against AD progression via suppression of Abeta deposition and BDNF decline, suppression of TNF-alpha production, support of brain antioxidant status, and amelioration of oxido-nitrosative stress and NT production.",

Dysregulation of these metals leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and eventually results in oxidative damage and accumulation of the Abeta peptide, which are the key elements of the disease. Aiming to pursue the discovery of new modulators for the disease, we here rationally focused on conjugating the core hydroxyquinoline of the metal-protein attenuating compound PBT2 and the N-methylanilide analogous moiety of the Abeta imaging agent to build a new type of multi-target modulators of Abeta aggregations. We found that the N,N-dimethylanilinyl imines 7a, 8a, and the corresponding amines 7b, 8b exerted efficient inhibition of Cu(2+) - or Zn(2+) -induced Abeta aggregations and significant disassembly of metal-mediated Abeta aggregated fibrils. Further, 7a and 7b also exhibited significant ROC scavenging effects compared to PBT2. The results suggested that 7a and 7b are promising lead compounds for the development of a new therapy for AD.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, in particular Abeta42 and Abeta40, exert neurotoxic effects and their overproduction leads to amyloid deposits in the brain, thus constituting an important biomolecular target for treatments of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We describe the engineering of cognate Anticalins as a novel type of neutralizing protein reagent based on the human lipocalin scaffold. Phage display selection from a genetic random library comprising variants of the human lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) with mutations targeted at 20 exposed amino acid positions in the four loops that form the natural binding site was performed using both recombinant and synthetic target peptides and resulted in three different Anticalins. Biochemical characterization of the purified proteins produced by periplasmic secretion in Escherichia coli revealed high folding stability in a monomeric state, with Tm values ranging from 53.4 C to 74.5 C, as well as high affinities for Abeta40, between 95 pM and 563 pM, as measured by real-time surface plasmon resonance analysis. The central linear VFFAED epitope within the Abeta sequence was mapped using a synthetic peptide array on membranes and was shared by all three Anticalins, despite up to 13 mutual amino acid differences in their binding sites. All Anticalins had the ability-with varying extent-to inhibit Abeta aggregation in vitro according to the thioflavin-T fluorescence assay and, furthermore, they abolished Abeta42-mediated toxicity in neuronal cell culture. Thus, these Anticalins provide not only useful protein reagents to study the molecular pathology of AD but they also show potential as alternative drug candidates compared with antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in the brain is the first critical step in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies in humans suggest that Abeta clearance from the brain is frequently impaired in late-onset AD. Abeta accumulation leads to the formation of Abeta aggregates, which injure synapses and contribute to eventual neurodegeneration. Cell surface heparan sulfates (HSs), expressed on all cell types including neurons, have been implicated in several features in the pathogenesis of AD including its colocalization with amyloid plaques and modulatory role in Abeta aggregation. We show that removal of neuronal HS by conditional deletion of the Ext1 gene, which encodes an essential glycosyltransferase for HS biosynthesis, in postnatal neurons of amyloid model APP/PS1 mice led to a reduction in both Abeta oligomerization and the deposition of amyloid plaques. In vivo microdialysis experiments also detected an accelerated rate of Abeta clearance in the brain interstitial fluid, suggesting that neuronal HS either inhibited or represented an inefficient pathway for Abeta clearance. We found that the amounts of various HS proteoglycans (HSPGs) were increased in postmortem human brain tissues from AD patients, suggesting that this pathway may contribute directly to amyloid pathogenesis. Our findings have implications for AD pathogenesis and provide insight into therapeutic interventions targeting Abeta-HSPG interactions.",

    "title": "ABCA7 Deficiency Accelerates Amyloid-beta Generation and Alzheimer's Neuronal Pathology.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the accumulation and deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain is a central event. Abeta is cleaved from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase mainly in neurons. Although mutations inAPP,PS1, orPS2cause early-onset familial AD,ABCA7encoding ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 is one of the susceptibility genes for late-onset AD (LOAD), in which itsloss-of-functionvariants increase the disease risk. ABCA7 is homologous to a major lipid transporter ABCA1 and is highly expressed in neurons and microglia in the brain. Here, we show that ABCA7 deficiency altered brain lipid profile and impaired memory in ABCA7 knock-out (Abca7(-/-)) mice. When bred to amyloid model APP/PS1 mice, plaque burden was exacerbated by ABCA7 deficit.In vivomicrodialysis studies indicated that the clearance rate of Abeta was unaltered. Interestingly, ABCA7 deletion facilitated the processing of APP to Abeta by increasing the levels of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) in primary neurons and mouse brains. Knock-down of ABCA7 expression in neurons caused endoplasmic reticulum stress highlighted by increased level of protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha). In the brains of APP/PS1;Abca7(-/-)mice, the level of phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) was also significantly elevated. Together, our results reveal novel pathways underlying the association of ABCA7 dysfunction and LOAD pathogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Gene variants inABCA7encoding ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 are associated with the increased risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Importantly, we found the altered brain lipid profile and impaired memory in ABCA7 knock-out mice. The accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides cleaved from amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the brain is a key event in AD pathogenesis and we also found that ABCA7 deficit exacerbated brain Abeta deposition in amyloid AD model APP/PS1 mice. Mechanistically, we found that ABCA7 deletion facilitated the processing of APP and Abeta production by increasing the levels of beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) in primary neurons and mouse brains without affecting the Abeta clearance rate in APP/PS1 mice. Our study demonstrates a novel mechanism underlying how dysfunctions of ABCA7 contribute to the risk for AD.",

    "title": "Fibrillar Amyloid-beta Accumulation Triggers an Inflammatory Mechanism Leading to Hyperphosphorylation of the Carboxyl-Terminal End of Tau Polypeptide in the Hippocampal Formation of the 3xTg-AD Transgenic Mouse.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative and irreversible disorder whose progressiveness is dependent on age. It is histopathologically characterized by the massive accumulation of insoluble forms of tau and amyloid-beta (Abeta) asneurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, respectively. Many studies have documented that these two polypeptides suffer several posttranslational modifications employing postmortem tissue sections from brains of patients with AD. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the posttranslational modifications of key players in this disease, including Abeta and tau, several transgenic mouse models have been developed. One of these models is the 3xTg-AD transgenic mouse, carrying three transgenes encoding APPSWE, S1M146V, and TauP301L proteins. To further characterize this transgenicmouse, we determined the accumulation of fibrillar Abeta as a function of age in relation to the hyperphosphorylation patterns of TauP301L at both its N- and C-terminus in the hippocampal formation by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Moreover, we searched for the expression of activated protein kinases and mediators of inflammation by western blot of wholeprotein extracts from hippocampal tissue sections since 3 to 28 months as well. Our results indicate that the presence of fibrillar Abeta deposits correlates with a significant activation of astrocytes and microglia in subiculum and CA1 regions of hippocampus. Accordingly, we also observed a significant increase in the expression of TNF-alpha associated to neuritic plaques and glial cells. Importantly, there is an overexpression of the stress activated protein kinases SAPK/JNK and Cdk-5 in pyramidal neurons, which might phosphorylate several residues at the C-terminus of TauP301L. Therefore, the accumulation of Abeta oligomers results in an inflammatory environment that upregulates kinases involved in hyperphosphorylation of TauP301L polypeptide.",

    "title": "Blood-Based Biomarker Candidates of Cerebral Amyloid Using PiB PET in Non-Demented Elderly.",
    "abstract": "Increasingly, clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are being conducted earlier in the disease phase and with biomarker confirmation using in vivo amyloid PET imaging or CSF tau and Abeta measures to quantify pathology. However, making such a pre-clinical AD diagnosis is relatively costly and the screening failure rate is likely to be high. Having a blood-based marker that would reduce such costs and accelerate clinical trials through identifying potential participants with likely pre-clinical AD would be a substantial advance. In order to seek such a candidate biomarker, discovery phase proteomic analyses using 2DGE and gel-free LC-MS/MS for high and low molecular weight analytes were conducted on longitudinal plasma samples collected over a 12-year period from non-demented older individuals who exhibited a range of 11C-PiB PET measures of amyloid load. We then sought to extend our discovery findings by investigating whether our candidate biomarkers were also associated with brain amyloid burden in disease, in an independent cohort. Seven plasma proteins, including A2M, Apo-A1, and multiple complement proteins, were identified as pre-clinical biomarkers of amyloid burden and were consistent across three time points (p <  0.05). Five of these proteins also correlated with brain amyloid measures at different stages of the disease (q <  0.1). Here we show that it is possible to detect a plasma based biomarker signature indicative of AD pathology at a stage long before the onset of clinical disease manifestation. As in previous studies, acute phase reactants and inflammatory markers dominate this signature.",

Here, we demonstrate hemicyanine-based benzothiazole-coumarin (TC) as a potential probe for the detection of highly toxic Abeta42 aggregates through switch-on, enhanced (~30 fold) red fluorescence (Emax = 654 nm) and characteristic colorimetric (light red to purple) optical outputs. Interestingly, TC exhibits selectivity towards Abeta42 fibrils compared to other abnormal protein aggregates. TC probe show nanomolar binding affinity (Ka = 1.72 x 10(7) M(-1)) towards Abeta42 aggregates and also displace ThT bound to Abeta42 fibrils due to its high binding affinity. The Abeta42 fibril-specific red-shift in the absorption spectra of TC responsible for the observed colorimetric optical output has been attributed to micro-environment change around the probe from hydrophilic-like to hydrophobic-like nature. The binding site, binding energy and changes in optical properties observed for TC upon interaction with Abeta42 fibrils have been further validated by molecular docking and time dependent density functional theory studies.",

Whenever DNA damage is too extensive, the DNA damage response pathway provides for triggering cellular senescence and/or apoptosis. However, whether the increased level of DNA damage in neurodegenerative disorders is a cause rather than the consequence of neurodegenerative events remains to be established. Among possible DNA lesions, DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are rare events, nevertheless they are the most lethal form of DNA damage. In neurons, DSBs are particularly deleterious because of their reduced DNA repair capability as compared to proliferating cells. Here, we provide a description of DSB repair systems and describe human studies showing the presence of several types of DNA lesions in three major neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD). Then, we analyze the role of DSB accumulation and deficiency of DSB repair systems in neurodegeneration by examining studies on animal models of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Involvement of microglia and complement in AD has been attributed to neuroinflammation, prominent late in disease. Here we show in mouse models that complement and microglia mediate synaptic loss early in AD. C1q, the initiating protein of the classical complement cascade, is increased and associated with synapses before overt plaque deposition. Inhibition of C1q, C3, or the microglial complement receptor CR3 reduces the number of phagocytic microglia, as well as the extent of early synapse loss. C1q is necessary for the toxic effects of soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers on synapses and hippocampal long-term potentiation. Finally, microglia in adult brains engulf synaptic material in a CR3-dependent process when exposed to soluble Abeta oligomers. Together, these findings suggest that the complement-dependent pathway and microglia that prune excess synapses in development are inappropriately activated and mediate synapse loss in AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder affecting the aging population. Neuroimaging methods, in particular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have helped reveal alterations in the brain structure, metabolism, and function of patients and in groups at risk of developing AD, yet the nature of these alterations is poorly understood. Neuroimaging in mice is attractive for investigating mechanisms underlying functional and structural changes associated with AD pathology. Several preclinical murine models of AD have been generated based on transgenic insertion of human mutated APP genes. Depending on the specific mutations, mouse strains express different aspects of amyloid pathology, e.g. intracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates, parenchymal plaques, or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. We have applied multi-parametric MRI in three transgenic mouse lines to compare changes in brain function with resting-state fMRI and structure with diffusion tensor imaging and high resolution anatomical imaging. E22DeltaAbeta developing intracellular Abeta aggregates did not present functional or structural alterations compared to their wild-type littermates. PSAPP mice displaying parenchymal amyloid plaques displayed mild functional changes within the supplementary and barrel field cortices, and increased isocortical volume relative to controls. Extensive reduction in functional connectivity in the sensory-motor cortices and within the default mode network, as well as local volume increase in the midbrain relative to wild-type have been observed in ArcAbeta mice bearing intracellular Abeta aggregates as well as parenchymal and vascular amyloid deposits. Patterns of functional and structural changes appear to be strain-specific and not directly related to amyloid deposition.",

    "abstract": "Protein S-nitrosation (SNO-protein), the nitric oxide-mediated posttranslational modification of cysteine thiols, is an important regulatory mechanism of protein function in both physiological and pathological pathways. A key first step toward elucidating the mechanism by which S-nitrosation modulates a protein's function is identification of the targeted cysteine residues. Here, we present a strategy for the simultaneous identification of SNO-cysteine sites and their cognate proteins to profile the brain of the CK-p25-inducible mouse model of Alzheimer's disease-like neurodegeneration. The approach-SNOTRAP (SNO trapping by triaryl phosphine)-is a direct tagging strategy that uses phosphine-based chemical probes, allowing enrichment of SNO-peptides and their identification by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. SNOTRAP identified 313 endogenous SNO-sites in 251 proteins in the mouse brain, of which 135 SNO-proteins were detected only during neurodegeneration. S-nitrosation in the brain shows regional differences and becomes elevated during early stages of neurodegeneration in the CK-p25 mouse. The SNO-proteome during early neurodegeneration identified increased S-nitrosation of proteins important for synapse function, metabolism, and Alzheimer's disease pathology. In the latter case, proteins related to amyloid precursor protein processing and secretion are S-nitrosated, correlating with increased amyloid formation. Sequence analysis of SNO-cysteine sites identified potential linear motifs that are altered under pathological conditions. Collectively, SNOTRAP is a direct tagging tool for global elucidation of the SNO-proteome, providing functional insights of endogenous SNO proteins in the brain and its dysregulation during neurodegeneration.",

DESIGN: Observation case using immunocytochemistry of an exenterated eye with immediate fixation after removal. PARTICIPANTS: Two patients, one with confirmed RPD and the other with mid-peripheral drusen, underwent multimethod imaging before exenteration and immediate fixation of the posterior eyecup for high-resolution immunocytochemical analysis. METHODS: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was compared with high-resolution immunocytochemistry using a range of cellular markers to determine changes in the RPE, photoreceptors, and gliosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Correlations of the appearance of reticular pseudodrusen on OCT and immunocytochemical analysis. RESULTS: Reticular pseudodrusen were deposits juxtaposed to photoreceptor outer segments extending through the outer nuclear layer and even beyond the outer limiting membrane. Deposits were rich in vitronectin, photoreceptor-associated proteins, and Iba1-immunoreactive immune cells. In contrast to conventional drusen the lipid stain Oil Red O failed to stain RPD. Cellular analysis revealed that RPD were associated with photoreceptor disruption and loss and localized gliosis. In addition, anomalies in the RPE were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Reticular pseudodrusen represent subretinal deposits that extend through the outer nuclear layer, affect photoreceptor integrity, and are associated with retinal gliosis and RPE damage.",

    "abstract": "The M-transcript of human choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) produces an 82-kDa protein (82-kDa ChAT) that concentrates in nuclei of cholinergic neurons. We assessed the effects of acute exposure to oligomeric amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) on 82-kDa ChAT disposition in SH-SY5Y neural cells, finding that acute exposure to Abeta1-42 results in increased association of 82-kDa ChAT with chromatin and formation of 82-kDa ChAT aggregates in nuclei. When measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq), we identified that Abeta1-42-exposure increases 82-kDa ChAT association with gene promoters and introns. The Abeta1-42-induced 82-kDa ChAT aggregates co-localize with special AT-rich binding protein 1 (SATB1), which anchors DNA to scaffolding/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs). SATB1 had a similar genomic association as 82-kDa ChAT, with both proteins associating with synapse and cell stress genes. After Abeta1-42 -exposure, both SATB1 and 82-kDa ChAT are enriched at the same S/MAR on the APP gene, with 82-kDa ChAT expression attenuating an increase in an isoform-specific APP mRNA transcript. Finally, 82-kDa ChAT and SATB1 have patterned genomic association at regions enriched with S/MAR binding motifs. These results demonstrate that 82-kDa ChAT and SATB1 play critical roles in the response of neural cells to acute Abeta-exposure.",

    "abstract": "One intriguing feature of prion diseases is their strain variation. Prion strains are differentiated by the clinical consequences they generate in the host, their biochemical properties, and their potential to infect other animal species. The selective targeting of these agents to specific brain structures have been extensively used to characterize prion strains. However, the molecular basis dictating strain-specific neurotropism are still elusive. In this study, isolated brain structures from animals infected with four hamster prion strains (HY, DY, 139H, and SSLOW) were analyzed for their content of protease-resistant PrP(Sc) Our data show that these strains have different profiles of PrP deposition along the brain. These patterns of accumulation, which were independent of regional PrP(C) production, were not reproduced by in vitro replication when different brain regions were used as substrate for the misfolding-amplification reaction. On the contrary, our results show that in vitro replication efficiency depended exclusively on the amount of PrP(C) present in each part of the brain. Our results suggest that the variable regional distribution of PrP(Sc) in distinct strains is not determined by differences on prion formation, but on other factors or cellular pathways. Our findings may contribute to understand the molecular mechanisms of prion pathogenesis and strain diversity.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is recognized as a causative factor for the cognitive impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The studies on the effects of Abeta to cognitive impairments are beneficial for lifting the veil of the pathophysiology in AD. Neuronal oscillations are proposed to play an important role in cognition and its ensuing behavior. Specially, the synchronized gamma oscillations are essential for the successful execution of working memory. However, whether the Abeta will induce the abnormal neuronal oscillations and working memory deficits has remained largely unexplored. In the present study, rats (control and Abeta-injected groups) were trained to perform a delay-alternation task on Y-maze while spikes and local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from multi-electrodes implanted in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an area that is strongly modulated by working memory. Synchronized neuronal oscillations were assessed by phase locking between spike trains and LFPs. We found the significant working memory impairment in the Abeta-injected group. Moreover, in the control group, during the memory retention period, a transient burst of gamma synchronization preceded an animal's correct choice, but not an animal's error choice. In the Abeta-injected group, however, gamma synchronization experience no change in neither correct nor error trials. Our results indicate that the Abeta1-42-induced dysfunction in gamma synchronization may provide a potential mechanism for working memory deficits.",

    "abstract": "gamma-Secretase complexes achieve the production of amyloid peptides playing a key role in Alzheimer disease. These proteases have many substrates involved in important physiological functions. They are composed of two constant subunits, nicastrin and PEN2, and two variable ones, presenilin (PS1 or PS2) and APH1 (APH1aL, APH1aS, or APH1b). Whether the composition of a given gamma-secretase complex determines a specific cellular targeting remains unsolved. Here we combined a bidirectional inducible promoter and 2A peptide technology to generate constructs for the temporary, stoichiometric co-expression of six different combinations of the four gamma-secretase subunits including EGFP-tagged nicastrin. These plasmids allow for the formation of functional gamma-secretase complexes displaying specific activities and maturations. We show that PS1-containing gamma-secretase complexes were targeted to the plasma membrane, whereas PS2-containing ones were addressed to the trans-Golgi network, to recycling endosomes, and, depending on the APH1-variant, to late endocytic compartments. Overall, these novel constructs unravel a presenilin-dependent subcellular targeting of gamma-secretase complexes. These tools should prove useful to determine whether the cellular distribution of gamma-secretase complexes contributes to substrate selectivity and to delineate regulations of their trafficking.",

    "title": "Evidence For and Against a Pathogenic Role of Reduced gamma-Secretase Activity in Familial Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "The majority of mutations causing familial Alzheimer's disease (fAD) have been found in the gene PRESENILIN1 (PSEN1) with additional mutations in the related gene PRESENILIN2 (PSEN2). The best characterized function of PRESENILIN (PSEN) proteins is in gamma-secretase enzyme activity. One substrate of gamma-secretase is encoded by the gene AMYLOID BETA A4 PRECURSOR PROTEIN (AbetaPP/APP) that is a fAD mutation locus. AbetaPP is the source of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide enriched in the brains of people with fAD or the more common, late onset, sporadic form of AD, sAD. These observations have resulted in a focus on gamma-secretase activity and Abeta as we attempt to understand the molecular basis of AD pathology. In this paper we briefly review some of the history of research on gamma-secretase in AD. We then discuss the main ideas regarding the role of gamma-secretase and the PSEN genes in this disease. We examine the significance of the \"fAD mutation reading frame preservation rule\" that applies to PSEN1 and PSEN2 (and AbetaPP) and look at alternative roles for AbetaPP and Abeta in fAD. We present a case for an alternative interpretation of published data on the role of gamma-secretase activity and fAD-associated mutations in AD pathology. Evidence supports a \"PSEN holoprotein multimer hypothesis\" where PSEN fAD mutations generate mutant PSEN holoproteins that multimerize with wild type holoprotein and dominantly interfere with an AD-critical function(s) such as autophagy or secretion of Abeta. Holoprotein multimerization may be required for the endoproteolysis that activates PSENs' gamma-secretase activity.",

    "abstract": "A strategy for activating transcription factor EB (TFEB) to restore autophagy flux may provide neuroprotection against Alzheimer's disease. Our previous study reported that gypenoside XVII (GP-17), which is a major saponin abundant in ginseng and Panax notoginseng, ameliorated amyloid-beta (Abeta)25-35-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells by regulating autophagy. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether GP-17 has neuroprotective effects on PC12 cells expressing the Swedish mutant of APP695 (APP695swe) and APP/PS1 mice. We also investigated the underlying mechanism. We found that GP-17 could significantly increase Atg5 expression and the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in APP695 cells, which was associated with a reduction in p62 expression. GP-17 also elevated the number of LC3 puncta in APP695 cells transduced with pCMV-GFP-LC3. GP-17 promoted the autophagy-based elimination of AbetaPP, Abeta40, and Abeta42 in APP695swe cells and prevented the formation of Abeta plaques in the hippocampus and cortex of APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, spatial learning and memory deficits were cured. Atg5 knockdown could abrogate the GP-17-mediated removal of AbetaPP, Abeta40, and Abeta42 in APP695swe cells. GP-17 upregulated LAMP-1, increased LysoTracker staining, and augmented LAMP-1/LC3-II co-localization. GP-17 could release TFEB from TFEB/14-3-3 complexes, which led to TFEB nuclear translocation and the induction of autophagy and lysosome biogenesis and resulted in the amelioration of autophagy flux. The knockdown of TFEB could abolish these effects of GP-17. In summary, these results demonstrated that GP-17 conferred protective effects to the cellular and rodent models of Alzheimer's disease by activating TFEB.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Clinical trials testing treatments for Alzheimer disease (AD) are increasingly focused on cognitively normal individuals in the preclinical phase of the disease. To optimize observing a treatment effect, such trials need to enroll cognitively normal individuals likely to show cognitive decline over the duration of the trial. OBJECTIVE: To identify which group of cognitively normal individuals shows the greatest cognitive decline over time based on their cerebrospinal fluid biomarker profile. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, cognitively normal participants were classified into 1 of the following 4 hypothetical preclinical AD groups using baseline cerebrospinal fluid levels of Abeta and tau or Abeta and phosphorylated tau (p-tau): stage 0 (high Abeta and low tau), stage 1 (low Abeta and low tau), stage 2 (low Abeta and high tau), and suspected non-AD pathology (SNAP) (high Abeta and high tau). The data presented herein were collected between August 1995 and August 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: An a priori cognitive composite score based on the following 4 tests previously shown to predict progression from normal cognition to symptom onset of mild cognitive impairment or dementia: Paired Associates immediate recall, Logical Memory delayed recall, Boston Naming, and Digit-Symbol Substitution. Linear mixed-effects models were used to compare the cognitive composite scores across the 4 groups over time, adjusting for baseline age, sex, education, and their interactions with time. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two cognitively normal participants were included in the analyses (mean follow-up, 11.0 years [range, 0-18.3 years] and mean baseline age, 56.9 years [range, 22.1-85.8 years]). Of these, 102 were stage 0, 46 were stage 1, 28 were stage 2, and 46 were SNAP. Individuals in stage 2 (low Abeta and high tau [or p-tau]) had lower baseline cognitive scores and a greater decline in the cognitive composite score relative to the other 3 groups (beta <= -0.06 for all and P <= .001 for the rate of decline for all). Individuals in stage 0, stage 1, and SNAP did not differ from one another in cognitive performance at baseline or over time (11.0 years) and showed practice-related improvement in performance. The APOE epsilon4 genotype was not associated with baseline cognitive composite score or the rate of change in the cognitive composite score. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest that, to optimize observing a treatment effect, clinical trials enrolling cognitively normal individuals should selectively recruit participants with abnormal levels of both amyloid and tau (ie, stage 2) because this group would be expected to show the greatest cognitive decline over time if untreated.",

    "abstract": "The endosome/lysosome pathway is disrupted early in the course of both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS); however, it is not clear how dysfunction in this pathway influences the development of these diseases. Herein, we explored the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which endosomal dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of AD and DS. We determined that full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its beta-C-terminal fragment (beta-CTF) act though increased activation of Rab5 to cause enlargement of early endosomes and to disrupt retrograde axonal trafficking of nerve growth factor (NGF) signals. The functional impacts of APP and its various products were investigated in PC12 cells, cultured rat basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), and BFCNs from a mouse model of DS. We found that the full-length wild-type APP (APPWT) and beta-CTF both induced endosomal enlargement and disrupted NGF signaling and axonal trafficking. beta-CTF alone induced atrophy of BFCNs that was rescued by the dominant-negative Rab5 mutant, Rab5S34N. Moreover, expression of a dominant-negative Rab5 construct markedly reduced APP-induced axonal blockage in Drosophila. Therefore, increased APP and/or beta-CTF impact the endocytic pathway to disrupt NGF trafficking and signaling, resulting in trophic deficits in BFCNs. Our data strongly support the emerging concept that dysregulation of Rab5 activity contributes importantly to early pathogenesis of AD and DS.",

Activity and lipid-binding assays confirm that these peptides act via a receptor-independent mechanism involving membrane interaction. The racemic crystal structure of BTD-2 solved at 1.45 A revealed a novel oligomeric form of beta-sheet antimicrobial peptides within the unit cell: an antiparallel trimer, which we suggest might be related to its membrane-active form. The BTD-2 oligomer extends into a larger supramolecular state that spans the crystal lattice, featuring a steric-zipper motif that is common in structures of amyloid-forming peptides. The supramolecular structure of BTD-2 thus represents a new mode of fibril-like assembly not previously observed for antimicrobial peptides, providing structural evidence linking antimicrobial and amyloid peptides.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide, characterized by progressive cognitive impairment and multiple distinct neuropathological features. Currently, there are no available therapies to delay or block the disease progression. Thus, the disease-modifying therapies are urgent for this devastating disorder by simultaneously targeting multiple distinct pathological processes. Morin, a natural bioflavonoid, have been shown to be strongly neuroprotective in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we first investigated the disease-modifying effects of chronic morin administration on the neuropathological and cognitive impairments in APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice. Our results showed that chronic morin administration prevented spatial learning and memory deficits in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Morin treatment in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice markedly reduced cerebral Abeta production and Abeta plaque burden via promoting non-amyloidogenic APP processing pathway by increasing ADAM10 expression, inhibiting amyloidogenic APP processing pathway by decreased BACE1 and PS1 expression, and facilitating Abeta degradation by enhancing Abeta-degrading enzyme expression. In addition, we also found that morin treatment in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice markedly decreased tau hyperphosphorylation via its inhibitory effect on CDK5 signal pathway. Furthermore, morin treatment in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice markedly reduced the activated glial cells and increased the expression of synaptic markers. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that chronic morin treatment restores cognitive functions and reverses multiple distinct neuropathological AD-like hallmarks in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. This study provides novel insights into the neuroprotective actions and neurobiological mechanisms of morin against AD, suggesting that morin is a potently promising disease-modifying agent for treatment of AD.",

    "title": "CSF and blood biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease biomarkers are important for early diagnosis in routine clinical practice and research. Three core CSF biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (Abeta42, T-tau, and P-tau) have been assessed in numerous studies, and several other Alzheimer's disease markers are emerging in the literature. However, there have been no comprehensive meta-analyses of their diagnostic performance. We systematically reviewed the literature for 15 biomarkers in both CSF and blood to assess which of these were most altered in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we screened PubMed and Web of Science for articles published between July 1, 1984, and June 30, 2014, about CSF and blood biomarkers reflecting neurodegeneration (T-tau, NFL, NSE, VLP-1, and HFABP), APP metabolism (Abeta42, Abeta40, Abeta38, sAPPalpha, and sAPPbeta), tangle pathology (P-tau), blood-brain-barrier function (albumin ratio), and glial activation (YKL-40, MCP-1, and GFAP). Data were taken from cross-sectional cohort studies as well as from baseline measurements in longitudinal studies with clinical follow-up. Articles were excluded if they did not contain a cohort with Alzheimer's disease and a control cohort, or a cohort with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease and a stable mild cognitive impairment cohort. Data were extracted by ten authors and checked by two for accuracy. For quality assessment, modified QUADAS criteria were used. Biomarker performance was rated by random-effects meta-analysis based on the ratio between biomarker concentration in patients with Alzheimer's disease and controls (fold change) or the ratio between biomarker concentration in those with mild cognitive impariment due to Alzheimer's disease and those with stable mild cognitive impairment who had a follow-up time of at least 2 years and no further cognitive decline. FINDINGS: Of 4521 records identified from PubMed and 624 from Web of Science, 231 articles comprising 15 699 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 13 018 controls were included in this analysis. The core biomarkers differentiated Alzheimer's disease from controls with good performance: CSF T-tau (average ratio 2 54, 95% CI 2 44-2 64, p<0 0001), P-tau (1 88, 1 79-1 97, p<0 0001), and Abeta42 (0 56, 0 55-0 58, p<0 0001). Differentiation between cohorts with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease and those with stable mild cognitive impairment was also strong (average ratio 0 67 for CSF Abeta42, 1 72 for P-tau, and 1 76 for T-tau). Furthermore, CSF NFL (2 35, 1 90-2 91, p<0 0001) and plasma T-tau (1 95, 1 12-3 38, p=0 02) had large effect sizes when differentiating between controls and patients with Alzheimer's disease, whereas those of CSF NSE, VLP-1, HFABP, and YKL-40 were moderate (average ratios 1 28-1 47). Other assessed biomarkers had only marginal effect sizes or did not differentiate between control and patient samples. INTERPRETATION: The core CSF biomarkers of neurodegeneration (T-tau, P-tau, and Abeta42), CSF NFL, and plasma T-tau were strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease and the core biomarkers were strongly associated with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease. Emerging CSF biomarkers NSE, VLP-1, HFABP, and YKL-40 were moderately associated with Alzheimer's disease, whereas plasma Abeta42 and Abeta40 were not. Due to their consistency, T-tau, P-tau, Abeta42, and NFL in CSF should be used in clinical practice and clinical research.

    "abstract": "A missense mutation (T835M) in the uncoordinated-5C (UNC5C) netrin receptor gene increases the risk of late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) and also the vulnerability of neurons harboring the mutation to various insults. The molecular mechanisms underlying T835M-UNC5C-induced death remain to be elucidated. In this study, we show that overexpression of wild-type UNC5C causes low-grade death, which is intensified by an AD-linked mutation T835M. An AD-linked survival factor, calmodulin-like skin protein (CLSP), and a natural ligand of UNC5C, netrin1, inhibit this death. T835M-UNC5C-induced neuronal cell death is mediated by an intracellular death-signaling cascade, consisting of death-associated protein kinase 1/protein kinase D/apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)/JNK/NADPH oxidase/caspases, which merges at ASK1 with a death-signaling cascade, mediated by amyloid beta precursor protein (APP). Notably, netrin1 also binds to APP and partially inhibits the death-signaling cascade, induced by APP. These results may provide new insight into the amyloid beta-independent pathomechanism of AD.",

Human studies suggest that one key factor leading to accumulation is a defect in brain Abeta clearance. We have developed a novel microimmunoelectrode (MIE) to study the kinetics of Abeta clearance using an electrochemical approach. This is the first study using MIEs in vivo to measure rapid changes in Abeta levels in the brains of living mice. Extracellular, interstitial fluid (ISF) Abeta levels were measured in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Baseline levels of Abeta40 in the ISF are relatively stable and begin to decline within minutes of blocking Abeta production with a gamma-secretase inhibitor. Pretreatment with a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, which blocks blood-brain barrier transport of Abeta, resulted in significant prolongation of Abeta40 half-life, but only in the latter phase of Abeta clearance from the ISF.",

    "abstract": "Brain copper imbalance plays an important role in amyloid-beta aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and neurotoxicity observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the administration of biocompatible metal-binding agents may offer a potential therapeutic solution to target mislocalized copper ions and restore metallostasis. Histidine-containing peptides and proteins are excellent metal binders and are found in many natural systems. The design of short peptides showing optimal binding properties represents a promising approach to capture and redistribute mislocalized metal ions, mainly due to their biocompatibility, ease of synthesis, and the possibility of fine-tuning their metal-binding affinities in order to suppress unwanted competitive binding with copper-containing proteins. In the present study, three peptides, namely HWH, HK(C) H, and HAH, have been designed with the objective of reducing copper toxicity in AD. These tripeptides form highly stable albumin-like complexes, showing higher affinity for Cu(II) than that of Abeta(1-40). Furthermore, HWH, HK(C) H, and HAH act as very efficient inhibitors of copper-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and prevent the copper-induced overproduction of toxic oligomers in the initial steps of amyloid aggregation in the presence of Cu(II) ions. These tripeptides, and more generally small peptides including the sequence His-Xaa-His at the N-terminus, may therefore be considered as promising motifs for the future development of new and efficient anti-Alzheimer drugs.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is accompanied by enhanced oxidative stress and excess free radicals. Phosphodiesterase 9 inhibitors (PDE-9Is) showed memory improving effects in many pharmacological deficit models. However, whether BAY 73-6691 (a selective PDE-9I) may attenuate the oxidative stress during the development of AD is still unclear. For this purpose, primary cultures of SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with 20muM beta-amyloid25-35 (Abeta25-35), followed by exposure to different concentrations (50, 100, 150 and 200mug/ml) of BAY 73-6691. Furthermore, the antioxidant effect of BAY 73-6691 was evaluated in mice subjected to intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta25-35 (day 0) and treatment with BAY 73-6691 by intraperitoneal injection once daily (days 1-10). Our results elucidated that treatment with BAY 73-6691 attenuated the Abeta25-35-induced cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells. In vivo, BAY 73-6691 protected Abeta25-35-induced oxidative damage in hippocampus, associated with the attenuation of impairments in hippocampal neurons. Administration of BAY 73-6691 improved learning and memory in the Morris water maze test, and restored several hippocampal memory-associated proteins. Our study identified a neuroprotective role for BAY 73-6691 against Abeta25-35-induced oxidative stress in vivo and in vitro, harboring therapeutic potential for the treatment of AD by alleviating the impairments in spatial memory and hippocampal neurons.",

Little is known, however, about the molecular consequences of phosphorylation of protein aggregates. Here we show that phosphorylation of beta-amyloid at serine 8 increases the stability of its pathogenic aggregates against high-pressure and SDS-induced dissociation. We further demonstrate that phosphorylation results in an elevated number of hydrogen bonds at the N terminus of beta-amyloid, the region that is critically regulated by a variety of post-translational modifications. Because of the increased lifetime of phosphorylated beta-amyloid aggregates, phosphorylation can promote the spreading of beta-amyloid in Alzheimer pathogenesis. Our study suggests that regulation of the molecular stability of protein aggregates by post-translational modifications is a crucial factor for disease progression in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a key event in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate the role of oxidative stress in AD and to search for potential biomarkers in peripheral blood, serums were collected in this study from the 3-, 6-, and 12-month-old triple transgenic AD mice (3xTg-AD mice) and the age- and sex-matched non-transgenic (non-Tg) littermates. The serum oxidized proteins were quantified by slot-blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to investigate the total levels of serum protein carbonyl groups. Western blotting, in conjunction with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-Oxyblot), was employed to identify and quantify the specifically-carbonylated proteins in the serum of 3xTg-AD mice. The results showed that the levels of serum protein carbonyls were increased in the three month old 3xTg-AD mice compared with the non-Tg control mice, whereas no significant differences were observed in the six and 12 months old AD mice, suggesting that oxidative stress is an early event in AD progression. With the application of 2D-Oxyblot analysis, (immunoglobin) Ig gamma-2B chain C region (IGH-3), Ig lambda-2 chain C region (IGLC2), Ig kappa chain C region (IGKC), and Ig kappa chain V-V region HP R16.7 were identified as significantly oxidized proteins compared with the control. Among them IGH-3 and IGKC were validated via immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis.

It is widely accepted that Abeta is the chief culprit of AD. Abeta peptide is the cleavage product of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP). Recently, more attention has been paid to O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) modification of protein. O-GlcNAcylation plays a significant role in hippocampal synaptic function. Abated O-GlcNAcylation might be a modulator in progression of AD through regulating activity of pertinent enzymes and factors. Evidence suggests that enhanced O-GlcNAcylation interacts with tau phosphorylation and prevents brain from tau and Abeta-induced impairment.

    "abstract": "To examine the antiamnesic effects of broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) leaves, we performed in vitro and in vivo tests on amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity. The chloroform fraction from broccoli leaves (CBL) showed a remarkable neuronal cell-protective effect and an inhibition against acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The ameliorating effect of CBL on Abeta1-42-induced learning and memory impairment was evaluated by Y-maze, passive avoidance, and Morris water maze tests. The results indicated improving cognitive function in the CBL group. After the behavioral tests, antioxidant effects were detected by superoxide dismutase (SOD), oxidized glutathione (GSH)/total GSH, and malondialdehyde (MDA) assays, and inhibition against AChE was also presented in the brain. Finally, oxo-dihydroxy-octadecenoic acid (oxo-DHODE) and trihydroxy-octadecenoic acid (THODE) as main compounds were identified by quadrupole time-of-flight ultraperformance liquid chromatography (Q-TOF UPLC-MS) analysis. Therefore, our studies suggest that CBL could be used as a natural resource for ameliorating Abeta1-42-induced learning and memory impairment.",

    "title": "The Associations between a Capsaicin-Rich Diet and Blood Amyloid-beta Levels and Cognitive Function.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Capsaicin-rich diets are common worldwide. Capsaicin has been shown to have favorable effects on various diseases including atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, obesity, hypertension, cancer, and gastrointestinal and inflammatory diseases. The impact of capsaicin on Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia in the elderly, remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlations of capsaicin intake with cognition and blood markers of AD. METHODS: A total of 338 participants aged 40 years or older were enrolled from communities. Dietary habits regarding chili pepper consumption were collected using a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Cognitive function was measured using the Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Blood amyloid-beta (Abeta)40 and Abeta42 were measured with ELISA kits. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, MMSE scores (r = 0.209, p < 0.001), serum Abeta40 levels (r = -0.149, p = 0.006), the ratio of Abeta42/Abeta40 (r = 0.11, p = 0.043) and total serum Abeta levels (r = -0.097, p = 0.075), but not serum Abeta42 levels (r = 0.17, p = 0.757), were significantly correlated with total capsaicin diet scores. In multivariate analysis, total capsaicin diet scores were positively associated with MMSE scores and inversely associated with serum Abeta40 levels, and total serum Abeta levels, but not serum Abeta42 levels and the ratio of Abeta42/Abeta40, after adjustment for age, gender, educational level, smoking history, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI) and comorbidities. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that a capsaicin-rich diet may exert favorable effects on AD blood biomarkers and cognitive function in middle-aged and elderly adults.",

    "title": "The Effect of Propofol Versus Isoflurane Anesthesia on Human Cerebrospinal Fluid Markers of Alzheimer's Disease: Results of a Randomized Trial.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies have found differential effects of isoflurane and propofol on the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated markers tau, phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and amyloid-beta (Abeta). OBJECTIVE: We asked whether isoflurane and propofol have differential effects on the tau/Abeta ratio (the primary outcome), and individual AD biomarkers. We also examined whether genetic/intraoperative factors influenced perioperative changes in AD biomarkers. METHODS: Patients undergoing neurosurgical/otolaryngology procedures requiring lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drain placement were prospectively randomized to receive isoflurane (n = 21) or propofol (n = 18) for anesthetic maintenance. We measured perioperative CSF sample AD markers, performed genotyping assays, and examined intraoperative data from the electronic anesthesia record. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to examine changes in AD markers by anesthetic type over time. RESULTS: The CSF tau/Abeta ratio did not differ between isoflurane- versus propofol-treated patients (p = 1.000). CSF tau/Abeta ratio and tau levels increased 10 and 24 h after drain placement (p = 2.002x10-6 and p = 1.985x10-6, respectively), mean CSF p-tau levels decreased (p = 0.005), and Abeta levels did not change (p = 0.152). There was no interaction between anesthetic treatment and time for any of these biomarkers. None of the examined genetic polymorphisms, including ApoE4, were associated with tau increase (n = 9 polymorphisms, p > 0.05 for all associations). CONCLUSION: Neurosurgery/otolaryngology procedures are associated with an increase in the CSF tau/Abeta ratio, and this increase was not influenced by anesthetic type. The increased CSF tau/Abeta ratio was largely driven by increases in tau levels. Future work should determine the functional/prognostic significance of these perioperative CSF tau elevations.",

    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), most hippocampal and cortical neurons show increased staining with anti-transthyretin (TTR) antibodies. Genetically programmed overexpression of wild type human TTR suppressed the neuropathologic and behavioral abnormalities in APP23 AD model mice and TTR-Abeta complexes have been isolated from some human AD brains and those of APP23 transgenic mice. In the present study, in vitro NMR analysis showed interaction between the hydrophobic thyroxine binding pocket of TTR and the cytoplasmic loop of the C99 fragment released by beta-secretase cleavage of AbetaPP, with Kd = 86+-9 muM. In cultured cells expressing both proteins, the interaction reduced phosphorylation of C99 (at T668) and suppressed its cleavage by gamma-secretase, significantly decreasing Abeta secretion. Coupled with its previously demonstrated capacity to inhibit Abeta aggregation (with the resultant cytotoxicity in tissue culture) and its regulation by HSF1, these findings indicate that TTR can behave as a stress responsive multimodal suppressor of AD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes actively participate in neuro-inflammatory processes associated to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other brain pathologies. We recently showed that an astrocyte-specific intracellular signaling pathway involving an interaction of the phosphatase calcineurin with the transcription factor FOXO3 is a major driver in AD-associated pathological inflammation, suggesting a potential new druggable target for this devastating disease. We have now developed decoy molecules to interfere with calcineurin/FOXO3 interactions, and tested them in astrocytes and neuronal co-cultures exposed to amyloid-beta (Abeta) toxicity. We observed that interference of calcineurin/FOXO3 interactions exerts a protective action against Abeta-induced neuronal death and favors the production of a set of growth factors that we hypothesize form part of a cytoprotective pathway to resolve inflammation. Furthermore, interference of the Abeta-induced interaction of calcineurin with FOXO3 by decoy compounds significantly decreased amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) synthesis, reduced the AbetaPP amyloidogenic pathway, resulting in lower Abeta levels, and blocked the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFalpha and IL-6 in astrocytes. Collectively, these data indicate that interrupting pro-inflammatory calcineurin/FOXO3 interactions in astrocytes triggered by Abeta accumulation in brain may constitute an effective new therapeutic approach in AD. Future studies with intranasal delivery, or brain barrier permeable decoy compounds, are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Abnormalities of autophagy can result in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms of autophagy in AD are not well understood. Here, we describe our findings that microRNA (miR)-299-5p functions as an autophagy inhibitor by suppressing Atg5 and antagonizing caspase-dependent apoptosis. We observed decreased levels of miR-299-5p both in primary neurons under conditions of starvation and in hippocampi of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Additionally, low levels of miR-299-5p were observed in cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients. MiR-299-5p treatment resulted in attenuation of Atg5 and autophagy in primary neurons from APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, N2a cells and SH-SY5Y cells, whereas antagomiR-299-5p enhanced autophagy. Atg5 was verified as a direct target of miR-299-5p by dual luciferase reporter assays. Furthermore, transfection of miR-299-5p into primary hippocampal neurons caused the attenuation of caspase-mediated apoptosis, which was reversed upon starvation-induced autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy by shRNA knockdown of LC3beta reduced apoptotic neuron death induced by antagomiR-299-5p. Injection of agomiR-299-5p into the cerebral ventricles of AD mice inhibited both autophagy and apoptosis and also improved the cognitive performance of mice. Overall, our results suggest that miR-299-5p modulates neuron survival programs by regulating autophagy. Thus, miR-299-5p serves as a potential neuroprotective factor in AD.",

A central step in the generation of toxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1). Here, we have elucidated whether downregulation of septin (SEPT) protein family members, which are implicated in synaptic plasticity and vesicular trafficking, affects APP processing and Abeta generation. SEPT8 was found to reduce soluble APPbeta and Abeta levels in neuronal cells through a post-translational mechanism leading to decreased levels of BACE1 protein. In the human temporal cortex, we identified alterations in the expression of specific SEPT8 transcript variants in a manner that correlated with Alzheimer's-disease-related neurofibrillary pathology. These changes were associated with altered beta-secretase activity. We also discovered that the overexpression of a specific Alzheimer's-disease-associated SEPT8 transcript variant increased the levels of BACE1 and Abeta peptides in neuronal cells. These changes were related to an increased half-life of BACE1 and the localization of BACE1 in recycling endosomes. These data suggest that SEPT8 modulates beta-amyloidogenic processing of APP through a mechanism affecting the intracellular sorting and accumulation of BACE1.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is the major component of extracellular plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. It has been suggested that the interaction of Abeta with membrane cholesterol is essential for Abeta to exert neurotoxicity; however, the effect of phospholipids, another major membrane lipid component, on Abeta-induced neurotoxicity remains unclarified. Here we report the protective effect of phosphatidylcholine (PC) on primary cultured neurons against Abeta1-42-induced damage. Abeta1-42 caused neuronal death as demonstrated by lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) release, which was completely prevented by a pretreatment with PC in a dose-dependent manner. PC containing unsaturated long-chain acyl groups, 1,2-dioleoyl-PC (DOPC), also prevented neuronal death caused by Abeta1-42. The oleic acid ethyl-ester (OAEE) partially prevented Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity. Neurons that were pretreated with DOPC or OAEE for 24h, washed out, and exposed to Abeta1-42 in the absence of either of these reagents, were still resistant to Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity. In contrast, treatment with phosphotidylserine (PS) or docosahexaenoic acid etyl-ester (DHAEE) had no protective effect on neurons against Abeta1-42-induced damage. These results suggest that the control of cellular PC content, not PS content, may prove useful in the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, places a large burden on families and society. Although epidemiological and clinical evidence suggests a relationship between inflammation and AD, their relationship is not well understood and could have implications for treatment and prevention strategies. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a subset of genes involved with increased risk of inflammation are also associated with increased risk for AD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a genetic epidemiology study conducted in July 2015, we systematically investigated genetic overlap between AD (International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project stage 1) and Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, and psoriasis using summary data from genome-wide association studies at multiple academic clinical research centers. P values and odds ratios from genome-wide association studies of more than 100 000 individuals were from previous comparisons of patients vs respective control cohorts. Diagnosis for each disorder was previously established for the parent study using consensus criteria. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the pleiotropic (conjunction) false discovery rate P value. Follow-up for candidate variants included neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology; longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale scores as a measure of cognitive dysfunction (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative); and gene expression in AD vs control brains (Gene Expression Omnibus data). RESULTS: Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (false discovery rate P < .05) were associated with both AD and immune-mediated diseases. Of these, rs2516049 (closest gene HLA-DRB5; conjunction false discovery rate P = .04 for AD and psoriasis, 5.37 x 10-5 for AD, and 6.03 x 10-15 for psoriasis) and rs12570088 (closest gene IPMK; conjunction false discovery rate P = .009 for AD and Crohn disease, P = 5.73 x 10-6 for AD, and 6.57 x 10-5 for Crohn disease) demonstrated the same direction of allelic effect between AD and the immune-mediated diseases. Both rs2516049 and rs12570088 were significantly associated with neurofibrillary tangle pathology (P = .01352 and .03151, respectively); rs2516049 additionally correlated with longitudinal decline on Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale scores (beta [SE], 0.405 [0.190]; P = .03). Regarding gene expression, HLA-DRA and IPMK transcript expression was significantly altered in AD brains compared with control brains (HLA-DRA: beta [SE], 0.155 [0.024]; P = 1.97 x 10-10; IPMK: beta [SE], -0.096 [0.013]; P = 7.57 x 10-13). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our findings demonstrate genetic overlap between AD and immune-mediated diseases and suggest that immune system processes influence AD pathogenesis and progression.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Essentials Evidence suggests a comorbidity between hyperhomocysteinemia (HHC) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Homocysteine (HC) could affect the beta-amyloid (Abeta)-fibrinogen interaction in AD pathology. AD patients with concomitant HHC have increased fibrin and Abeta deposits in their brains. HC contributes to AD pathology via the Abeta-fibrinogen interaction. SUMMARY: Background Accumulating clinical evidence suggests that hyperhomocysteinemia (HHC) is correlated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia. Objective This study was carried out to elucidate the specific role of elevated homocysteine (HC) levels in AD pathophysiology. Methods Immunohistochemistry was used to examine beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition along blood vessels, also known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), fibrin(ogen) deposition, and their correlation to each other in the brains of AD patients with and without HHC. To study AD-HHC co-morbidity in detail, an AD mouse model was administered a high methionine diet for several months. Parenchymal Abeta plaques, CAA-positive vessels and fibrin deposits were then assessed by immunohistochemistry at different stages of AD progression. Memory deficits were evaluated with contextual fear conditioning and the Barnes maze. Additionally, the effect of HC and its metabolite, homocysteine thiolactone (HCTL), on the Abeta-fibrinogen interaction was analyzed by pull-down, ELISA and fibrin clot formation and fibrinolysis assays in vitro. Results We found increased fibrin(ogen) levels and Abeta deposits in the blood vessels and brain parenchyma of AD patients with HHC. We demonstrate that HC and HCTL enhance the interaction between fibrinogen and Abeta, promote the formation of tighter fibrin clots and delay clot fibrinolysis. Additionally, we show that diet-induced HHC in an AD mouse model leads to severe CAA and parenchymal Abeta deposition, as well as significant impairments in learning and memory. Conclusions These findings suggest that elevated levels of plasma HC/HCTL contribute to AD pathology via the Abeta-fibrin(ogen) interaction.",

    "abstract": "Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a microglial receptor that recognizes changes in the lipid microenvironment, which may occur during amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation and neuronal degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rare TREM2 variants that affect TREM2 function lead to an increased risk of developing AD. In murine models of AD, TREM2 deficiency prevents microglial clustering around Abeta deposits. However, the origin of myeloid cells surrounding amyloid and the impact of TREM2 on Abeta accumulation are a matter of debate. Using parabiosis, we found that amyloid-associated myeloid cells derive from brain-resident microglia rather than from recruitment of peripheral blood monocytes. To determine the impact of TREM2 deficiency on Abeta accumulation, we examined Abeta plaques in the 5XFAD model of AD at the onset of Abeta-related pathology. At this early time point, Abeta accumulation was similar in TREM2-deficient and -sufficient 5XFAD mice. However, in the absence of TREM2, Abeta plaques were not fully enclosed by microglia; they were more diffuse, less dense, and were associated with significantly greater neuritic damage. Thus, TREM2 protects from AD by enabling microglia to surround and alter Abeta plaque structure, thereby limiting neuritic damage.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating condition with no known effective treatment. AD is characterized by memory loss as well as impaired locomotor ability, reasoning, and judgment. Emerging evidence suggests that the innate immune response plays a major role in the pathogenesis of AD. In AD, the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the brain perturbs physiological functions of the brain, including synaptic and neuronal dysfunction, microglial activation, and neuronal loss. Serum levels of soluble ST2 (sST2), a decoy receptor for interleukin (IL)-33, increase in patients with mild cognitive impairment, suggesting that impaired IL-33/ST2 signaling may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, we investigated the potential therapeutic role of IL-33 in AD, using transgenic mouse models. Here we report that IL-33 administration reverses synaptic plasticity impairment and memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice. IL-33 administration reduces soluble Abeta levels and amyloid plaque deposition by promoting the recruitment and Abeta phagocytic activity of microglia; this is mediated by ST2/p38 signaling activation. Furthermore, IL-33 injection modulates the innate immune response by polarizing microglia/macrophages toward an antiinflammatory phenotype and reducing the expression of proinflammatory genes, including IL-1beta, IL-6, and NLRP3, in the cortices of APP/PS1 mice. Collectively, our results demonstrate a potential therapeutic role for IL-33 in AD.",

Although precise mechanisms that trigger Abeta accumulation remain unclear, BACE1 inhibition undoubtedly represents an important intervention that may prevent and/or cure AD. Remarkably, animal model studies with knockouts, virus-delivered small interfering RNAs, immunization and bioavailable small-molecule agents that specifically inhibit BACE1 activity strongly support the idea for the therapeutic BACE1 inhibition. Meanwhile, a growing number of BACE1 substrates besides APP uncover new physiological roles of this protease, raising some concern regarding the safety of BACE1 inhibition. Here, I review recent progress in preclinical studies that have evaluated the efficacies and potential limitations of genetic/pharmacological inhibition of BACE1, with special focus on AD-associated phenotypes including synaptic dysfunction, neuron loss and memory deficits in animal models.",

While death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is highly expressed in AD brains and its genetic variants are linked to AD risk, little is known about the impact of DAPK1 on APP metabolism and Abeta generation. In this study, we demonstrated a novel effect of DAPK1 in the regulation of APP processing using cell culture and mouse models. DAPK1, but not its kinase deficient mutant (K42A), significantly increased human Abeta secretion in neuronal cell culture models. Moreover, knockdown of DAPK1 expression or inhibition of DAPK1 catalytic activity significantly decreased Abeta secretion. Furthermore, DAPK1, but not K42A, triggered Thr668 phosphorylation of APP, which may initiate and facilitate amyloidogenic APP processing leading to the generation of Abeta. In Tg2576 APPswe-overexpressing mice, knockout of DAPK1 shifted APP processing toward non-amyloidogenic pathway and decreased Abeta generation. Finally, in AD brains, elevated DAPK1 levels showed co-relation with the increase of APP phosphorylation. Combined together, these results suggest that DAPK1 promotes the phosphorylation and amyloidogenic processing of APP, and that may serve a potential therapeutic target for AD.",

We addressed these issues by testing the effects of expressing the alternative oxidase AOX from Ciona intestinalis, in different models of AD pathology. AOX can restore respiratory electron flow when the cytochrome segment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is inhibited, supporting ATP synthesis, maintaining cellular redox homeostasis and mitigating excess superoxide production at respiratory complexes I and III. In human HEK293-derived cells, AOX expression decreased the production of beta-amyloid peptide resulting from antimycin inhibition of respiratory complex III. Because hydrogen peroxide was neither a direct product nor substrate of AOX, the ability of AOX to mimic antioxidants in this assay must be indirect. In addition, AOX expression was able to partially alleviate the short lifespan of Drosophila models neuronally expressing human beta-amyloid peptides, whilst abrogating the induction of markers of oxidative stress. Our findings support the idea of respiratory chain dysfunction and excess ROS production as both an early step and as a pathologically meaningful target in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, supporting the concept of a mitochondrial vicious cycle underlying the disease.",

    "abstract": "A common approach to understanding neurodegenerative disease is comparing gene expression in diseased versus healthy tissues. We illustrate that expression profiles derived from whole tissue RNA highly reflect the degenerating tissues' altered cellular composition, not necessarily transcriptional regulation. To accurately understand transcriptional changes that accompany neuropathology, we acutely purify neurons, astrocytes and microglia from single adult mouse brains and analyse their transcriptomes by RNA sequencing. Using peripheral endotoxemia to establish the method, we reveal highly specific transcriptional responses and altered RNA processing in each cell type, with Tnfr1 required for the astrocytic response. Extending the method to an Alzheimer's disease model, we confirm that transcriptomic changes observed in whole tissue are driven primarily by cell type composition, not transcriptional regulation, and identify hundreds of cell type-specific changes undetected in whole tissue RNA. Applying similar methods to additional models and patient tissues will transform our understanding of aberrant gene expression in neurological disease.",

    "abstract": "Recently it was proposed that the familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) causing presenilin (PSEN) mutations PSEN1-L435F and PSEN1-C410Y do not support the generation of Abeta-peptides from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). This challenges the amyloid hypothesis and disagrees with previous work showing that PSEN1 FAD causing mutations generate invariably long Abeta and seed amyloid. We contrast here the proteolytic activities of these mutant PSEN alleles with the complete loss-of-function PSEN1-D257A allele. We find residual carboxy- and endo-peptidase gamma-secretase activities, similar to the formerly characterized PSEN1-R278I. We conclude that the PSEN1-L435F and -C410Y mutations are extreme examples of the previously proposed \"dysfunction\" of gamma-secretase that characterizes FAD-associated PSEN.

Production and steady-state levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42 are undetectable in KI/KI brains and reduced in KI/+ brains, though the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio is slightly increased in KI/+ brains. Moreover, the FAD mutation impairs synaptic function, learning and memory, and age-dependent neuronal survival in the adult brain. Here we extend our analysis of the effects of the L435F and C410Y mutations to the generation of Abeta43. Similar to Abeta40 and Abeta42, production of Abeta43 is undetectable in KI/KI brains and reduced in KI/+ brains. These results support our previous conclusions that the L435F and C410Y mutations cause loss of Presenilin function and gamma-secretase activity, including impaired Abeta production in the brain.

In this study, we report the results of a 12-month, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study that investigated the ability of a curcumin formulation to prevent cognitive decline in a population of community-dwelling older adults. Individuals (n 96) ingested either placebo or 1500 mg/d BiocurcumaxTM for 12 months. A battery of clinical and cognitive measures was administered at baseline and at the 6-month and 12-month follow-up assessments. A significant timextreatment group interaction was observed for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (repeated-measures analysis; timextreatment; F=3 85, P<0 05). Subsequent analysis revealed that this association was driven by a decline in function of the placebo group at 6 months that was not observed in the curcumin treatment group. No differences were observed between the groups for all other clinical and cognitive measures. Our findings suggest that further longitudinal assessment is required to investigate changes in cognitive outcome measures, ideally in conjunction with biological markers of neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition manifested by synaptic dysfunction and memory loss, but the mechanisms underlying synaptic failure are not entirely understood. Although dopamine is a key modulator of synaptic plasticity, dopaminergic neurotransmission dysfunction in AD has mostly been associated to noncognitive symptoms. Thus, we aimed to study the relationship between dopaminergic neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in AD models. We used a transgenic model of AD (triple-transgenic mouse model of AD) and the administration of exogenous amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers into wild type mice. We found that Abeta decreased cortical dopamine levels and converted in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) into long-term depression (LTD) after high-frequency stimulation delivered at basolateral amygdaloid nucleus-insular cortex projection, which led to impaired recognition memory. Remarkably, increasing cortical dopamine and norepinephrine levels rescued both high-frequency stimulation -induced LTP and memory, whereas depletion of catecholaminergic levels mimicked the Abeta-induced shift from LTP to LTD. Our results suggest that Abeta-induced dopamine depletion is a core mechanism underlying the early synaptopathy and memory alterations observed in AD models and acts by modifying the threshold for the induction of cortical LTP and/or LTD.",

Alternatively, the dual-pathway hypothesis suggests that Abeta and abnormal Tau are two independent factors that exert synergistic effects on synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. We hypothesize that the intrinsic interaction of Abeta and Tau would better predict cognitive impairment. Herein, we propose an Abeta-Tau interactive model based on a review of the medical literature, mathematic modeling, and analysis of our clinicopathological data.",

In the human cingulate cortex, AbetaPP was preferentially located in the presynaptic active zone as in rodents, indicating a preserved subsynaptic AbetaPP distribution across species and brain regions. Synaptic AbetaPP immunoreactivity was decreased with aging in cortical samples collected from autopsies of males (20-80 years), whereas the synaptic levels of alpha-secretase (ADAM10) and beta-secretase (BACE1) did not significantly change.

NFTs and neuritic plaques are well-established contributors to cognitive impairment, but whether the Thal amyloid stage independently predicts antemortem cognition remains unknown. We used the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center autopsy data set to build adjacent-categories logit regression models with CDR-SOB and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores as cognitive outcome variables. Increasing CERAD scores were independently associated with higher CDR-SOB scores, whereas increasing Braak NFT stages predicted both higher CDR-SOB and lower MMSE scores. Increasing Thal amyloid stages were not significantly independently associated with either outcome measure. Increasing ABC scores predicted higher CDR-SOB and lower MMSE scores. These results raise the possibility that Thal amyloid stages do not substantially contribute to predicting antemortem cognition compared to CERAD neuritic plaque scores and Braak NFT stages, and suggest that the diffuse amyloid deposits participating in the assignment of Thal amyloid stages are neutral with respect to clinically detectable cognitive and functional changes.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological and genetic studies have identified metabolic disorders and inflammation as risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Evidence in obesity and type-2 diabetes suggests a role for a metabolic inflammasome (\"metaflammasome\") in mediating chronic inflammation in peripheral organs implicating IKKbeta (inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta), IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1), JNK (c-jun N-terminal kinase), and PKR (double-stranded RNA protein kinase). We hypothesized that these proteins are expressed in the brain in response to metabolic risk factors in AD. Neocortex from 299 participants from the MRC Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies was analysed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of the phosphorylated (active) form of IKKbeta [pSer176/180 ], IRS1 [pS312 ], JNK [pThr183 /Tyr185 ] and PKR [pT451 ]. The data were analyzed to investigate whether the proteins were expressed together and in relation with metabolic disorders, dementia, Alzheimer's pathology and APOE genotype. We observed a change from a positive to a negative association between the proteins and hypertension according to the dementia status. Type-2 diabetes was negatively related with the proteins among participants without dementia; whereas participants with dementia and AD pathology showed a positive association with JNK. A significant association between IKKbeta and JNK in participants with dementia and AD pathology was observed, but not in those without dementia. Otherwise, weak to moderate associations were observed among the protein loads. The presence of dementia was significantly associated with JNK and negatively associated with IKKbeta and IRS1. Cognitive scores showed a significant positive relationship with IKKbeta and a negative with IRS1, JNK and PKR. The proteins were significantly associated with pathology in Alzheimer's participants with the relationship being inverse or not significant in participants without dementia. Expression of the proteins was not related to APOE genotype. These findings highlight a role for these proteins in AD pathophysiology but not necessarily as a complex.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In Alzheimer's disease (AD), pathologic amyloid-beta (Abeta) is synaptotoxic and impairs neuronal function at the microscale, influencing brain networks at the macroscale before Abeta deposition. The latter can be detected noninvasively, in vivo, using resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), a technique used to assess brain functional connectivity (FC). METHODS: RsfMRI was performed longitudinally in TG2576 and PDAPP mice, starting before Abeta deposition to determine the earliest FC changes. Additionally, the role of pathologic Abeta on early FC alterations was investigated by treating TG2576 mice with the 3D6 anti-Abeta-antibody. RESULTS: Both transgenic models showed hypersynchronized FC before Abeta deposition and hyposynchronized FC at later stages. Early anti-Abeta treatment in TG2576 mice prevented hypersynchronous FC and the associated synaptic impairments and excitatory/inhibitory disbalances. DISCUSSION: Hypersynchrony of FC may be used as a new noninvasive read out of early AD and can be recovered by anti-Abeta treatment, encouraging preventive treatment strategies in familial AD.",

Here we demonstrate the capacity of a synthetic foldamer to capture structure in a disease relevant peptide. Oligoquinoline amides have a defined fold with a solvent-excluded core that is independent of its outwardly projected, derivatizable moieties. Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is a peptide central to beta-cell pathology in type II diabetes. A tetraquinoline is presented that stabilizes a pre-amyloid, alpha-helical conformation of IAPP. This charged, dianionic compound is readily soluble in aqueous buffer, yet crosses biological membranes without cellular assistance: an unexpected capability that is a consequence of its ability to reversibly fold. The tetraquinoline docks specifically with intracellular IAPP and rescues beta-cells from toxicity. Taken together, our work here supports the thesis that stabilizing non-toxic conformers of a plastic protein is a viable strategy for cytotoxic rescue addressable using oligoquinoline amides.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress and the formation of amyloid plaques containing amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are two key hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. A proportion of methionine (Met) at position 35 within Abeta is oxidized to methionine sulphoxide (Met(OX)) within the Alzheimer's plaques. These oxidative processes may be the key to understanding the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. In vitro oxidation of Abeta, by the physiological oxidant H2O2, was monitored using (1)H NMR and mass spectrometry. Here we investigate the effect of Abeta methionine oxidation on fiber formation kinetics and morphology using the amyloid specific fluorescence dye Thioflavin T (ThT) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Methionine oxidation reduces the total amount of fibers generated for both dominant forms of Abeta, however there are marked differences in the effect of Met(OX) between Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42). Surprisingly the presence of Met(OX) reduces lag-times for Abeta(1-40) fiber formation but extends lag-times for Abeta(1-42). TEM indicates a change in fiber morphology with a pronounced reduction in fiber length for both methionine oxidized Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42). In contrast, the morphology of preformed amyloid fibers is largely unaffected by the presence of H2O2. Our studies suggest that methionine oxidation promotes highly fragmented fiber assemblies of Abeta. Oxidative stress associated with Alzheimer's disease can cause oxidation of methionine within Abeta and this in turn will influence the complex assembly of Abeta monomer into amyloid fibers, which is likely to impact Abeta toxicity.",

    "title": "Amyloid-beta plaques disrupt axon initial segments.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques are one of the central pathologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plaque formation in animal models of AD coincides with the appearance of synaptic abnormalities, aberrant neuronal excitability, and cognitive decline. Abeta plaques may disrupt neuronal excitability since they have been proposed to be synaptotoxic, to induce axonal varicosities and neurite breakage, and to significantly decrease spine density. Axon initial segments (AIS) also regulate neuronal excitability and help maintain neuronal polarity. Despite these essential functions, the effects of plaques on AIS structure have not been fully determined. Using a mouse AD model, we measured a significant decrease in the density of AIS up to 75mum away from the center of fibrillar, thioflavin-labeled plaques. The reduction was observed in animals with both moderate and severe plaque loads, and was associated with increased densities of microglia near the plaques. Furthermore, animals with severe plaque loads had significantly reduced AIS lengths adjacent to Abeta plaques. These results suggest the local environment surrounding Abeta plaques may be harmful to the AIS. We propose that AIS loss is a previously unappreciated consequence of AD that could significantly impact brain function. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This paper demonstrates that neurons near Abeta plaques have disrupted axon initial segments. Loss or disruption of AIS is predicted to have detrimental consequences for brain function.",

    "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of severe vision loss worldwide. Amyloid beta involvement in degenerative diseases such as AMD is well known and its toxicity has been related to P2X7 receptor-pannexin-1. Recently, oxysterols (oxidized derivatives of cholesterol) have been implicated in AMD pathogenesis. The aim of our study was to highlight amyloid beta/oxysterols relationship and to describe P2X7 receptor-pannexin-1 role in oxysterols toxicity. Using retinal epithelial cells, we first quantified sterols levels after amyloid beta incubation and second we investigated the cytotoxic effects induced by oxysterols. For the first time, our results showed that amyloid beta induced oxysterols formation in human retinal pigmented epithelial cells. We showed that oxysterol toxicity is mediated by P2X7 receptor activation. This activation was dependent on pannexin-1 with 25-hydroxycholesterol whereas P2X7 receptor signaling pathway was pannexin-1-independent for 7-ketocholesterol. Taken together our data suggest a pivotal role of P2X7 receptor-pannexin-1 in oxysterols toxicity in retinal cells which could be an important target to develop new treatments for AMD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of gastrodin (GAS), one of the major bioactive components of Gastrodia elata Blume (Tian Ma), against amyloid beta (Abeta) (1-42)-induced neurotoxicity in primary neural progenitor cells (NPCs). We found that pretreatment with GAS not only prevents a loss in cell viability following treatment with Abeta (1-42) but also counteracts Abeta (1-42)-triggered release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, GAS was able to attenuate Abeta (1-42)-induced apoptosis in NPCs, evidenced by the decreased percentage of apoptotic cells and altered expression of apoptosis-related proteins in response to GAS pretreatment prior to Abeta (1-42) exposure. Furthermore, in Abeta (1-42)-injected C57BL/6 mice, we found that systemic administration of GAS could improve hippocampal neurogenesis, manifested by the increased number of SOX-2 and doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells in the DG area. Mechanistic studies revealed that in NPCs, GAS could reverse the Abeta (1-42)-induced increase in phosphorylation of MEK-1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). When combining GAS with the MEK inhibitor U0126 or the JNK inhibitor SP600125, we observed a synergistic effect against Abeta (1-42)-induced reduction in cell viability of NPCs. Taken together, these results show the efficacy and underlying mechanism of GAS against amyloid beta (1-42)-induced neurotoxicity and provide substantial insight into the potential merits of GAS for its clinical application in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Studies of long-lived individuals have revealed few genetic mechanisms for protection against age-associated disease. Therefore, we pursued genome sequencing of a related phenotype-healthy aging-to understand the genetics of disease-free aging without medical intervention. In contrast with studies of exceptional longevity, usually focused on centenarians, healthy aging is not associated with known longevity variants, but is associated with reduced genetic susceptibility to Alzheimer and coronary artery disease. Additionally, healthy aging is not associated with a decreased rate of rare pathogenic variants, potentially indicating the presence of disease-resistance factors. In keeping with this possibility, we identify suggestive common and rare variant genetic associations implying that protection against cognitive decline is a genetic component of healthy aging. These findings, based on a relatively small cohort, require independent replication. Overall, our results suggest healthy aging is an overlapping but distinct phenotype from exceptional longevity that may be enriched with disease-protective genetic factors. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",

Here, we hypothesize that these late unavoidable events might be the consequence of earlier complications occurring while amyloid precursor protein (APP) is trafficking through the early secretory pathway. We investigated the relevance to AD of coat protein complex I (COPI)-dependent trafficking, an early step in Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrograde transport and one of the very first trafficking steps. Using a complex set of imaging technologies, including inverse fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (iFRAP) and photoactivatable probes, coupled to biochemical experiments, we show that COPI subunit delta (delta-COP) affects the biology of APP, including its subcellular localization and cell surface expression, its trafficking, and its metabolism. These findings demonstrate the crucial role of delta-COP in APP metabolism and, consequently, the generation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, providing previously nondescribed mechanistic explanations of the underlying events.",

The Abeta25-35 fraction has shown the most toxicity; its neurotoxic mechanisms are associated with the generation of oxidative stress and reactive astrogliosis that induce neuronal death and memory impairment. Studies indicate that pharmacological treatment with flavonoids reduces the rate of AD, in particular, it has been shown that antioxidants are compounds that could interact with this peptide due to their antioxidant proprieties. In this study, experimental and computational tools were used to calculate the molecular electrostatic potential and the Fukui function with the Gaussian 09 computational program, to predict the most reactive parts of these molecules and make the complex between Abeta25-35 and two flavonoids (catechin and epicatechin) in the absolute gas-phase, where a possible interaction between them was observed. This is important for understanding the Abeta25-35-Flavonoid (A-F) interaction as a therapeutic strategy to inhibit the neurotoxic effects that this peptide causes in AD, which currently is still considered an ambiguous process.",

    "title": "Importance of the Dimethylamino Functionality on a Multifunctional Framework for Regulating Metals, Amyloid-beta, and Oxidative Stress in Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "The complex and multifaceted pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to present a formidable challenge to the establishment of long-term treatment strategies. Multifunctional compounds able to modulate the reactivities of various pathological features, such as amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation, metal ion dyshomeostasis, and oxidative stress, have emerged as a useful tactic. Recently, an incorporation approach to the rational design of multipurpose small molecules has been validated through the production of a multifunctional ligand (ML) as a potential chemical tool for AD. In order to further the development of more diverse and improved multifunctional reagents, essential pharmacophores must be identified. Herein, we report a series of aminoquinoline derivatives (AQ1-4, AQP1-4, and AQDA1-3) based on ML's framework, prepared to gain a structure-reactivity understanding of ML's multifunctionality in addition to tuning its metal binding affinity. Our structure-reactivity investigations have implicated the dimethylamino group as a key component for supplying the antiamyloidogenic characteristics of ML in both the absence and presence of metal ions. Two-dimensional NMR studies indicate that structural variations of ML could tune its interaction sites along the Abeta sequence. In addition, mass spectrometric analyses suggest that the ability of our aminoquinoline derivatives to regulate metal-induced Abeta aggregation may be influenced by their metal binding properties. Moreover, structural modifications to ML were also observed to noticeably change its metal binding affinities and metal-to-ligand stoichiometries that were shown to be linked to their antiamyloidogenic and antioxidant activities. Overall, our studies provide new insights into rational design strategies for multifunctional ligands directed at regulating metal ions, Abeta, and oxidative stress in AD and could advance the development of improved next-generation multifunctional reagents.",

    "title": "Efficient introduction of specific homozygous and heterozygous mutations using CRISPR/Cas9.",
    "abstract": "The bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system allows sequence-specific gene editing in many organisms and holds promise as a tool to generate models of human diseases, for example, in human pluripotent stem cells. CRISPR/Cas9 introduces targeted double-stranded breaks (DSBs) with high efficiency, which are typically repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) resulting in nonspecific insertions, deletions or other mutations (indels). DSBs may also be repaired by homology-directed repair (HDR) using a DNA repair template, such as an introduced single-stranded oligo DNA nucleotide (ssODN), allowing knock-in of specific mutations. Although CRISPR/Cas9 is used extensively to engineer gene knockouts through NHEJ, editing by HDR remains inefficient and can be corrupted by additional indels, preventing its widespread use for modelling genetic disorders through introducing disease-associated mutations. Furthermore, targeted mutational knock-in at single alleles to model diseases caused by heterozygous mutations has not been reported. Here we describe a CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing framework that allows selective introduction of mono- and bi-allelic sequence changes with high efficiency and accuracy. We show that HDR accuracy is increased dramatically by incorporating silent CRISPR/Cas-blocking mutations along with pathogenic mutations, and establish a method termed 'CORRECT' for scarless genome editing. By characterizing and exploiting a stereotyped inverse relationship between a mutation's incorporation rate and its distance to the DSB, we achieve predictable control of zygosity. Homozygous introduction requires a guide RNA targeting close to the intended mutation, whereas heterozygous introduction can be accomplished by distance-dependent suboptimal mutation incorporation or by use of mixed repair templates. Using this approach, we generated human induced pluripotent stem cells with heterozygous and homozygous dominant early onset Alzheimer's disease-causing mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP(Swe)) and presenilin 1 (PSEN1(M146V)) and derived cortical neurons, which displayed genotype-dependent disease-associated phenotypes. Our findings enable efficient introduction of specific sequence changes with CRISPR/Cas9, facilitating study of human disease.",

    "title": "Copper Exposure Perturbs Brain Inflammatory Responses and Impairs Clearance of Amyloid-Beta.",
    "abstract": "Copper promotes a toxic buildup of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangle pathology in the brain, and its exposure may increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, underlying molecular mechanisms by which copper triggers such pathological changes remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that the copper exposure perturbs brain inflammatory responses, leading to impairment of Abeta clearance from the brain parenchyma. Here, we investigated whether copper attenuated Abeta clearance by microglial phagocytosis or by low-density lipoprotein-related receptor protein-1 (LRP1) dependent transcytosis in both in vitro and in vivo When murine monocyte BV2 cells were exposed to copper, their phagocytic activation induced by fibrillar Abeta or LPS was significantly reduced, while the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6, were increased. Interestingly, not only copper itself but also IL-1beta, IL-6, or TNF-alpha were capable of markedly reducing the expression of LRP1 in human microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) in a concentration-dependent manner. While copper-mediated downregulation of LRP1 was proteasome-dependent, the cytokine-induced loss of LRP1 was proteasome- or lysosome-independent. In the mouse model, copper exposure also significantly elevated neuroinflammation and downregulated LRP1 in the brain, consistent with our in vitro results. Taken together, our findings support the pathological impact of copper on inflammatory responses and Abeta clearance in the brain, which could serve as key mechanisms to explain, in part, the copper exposure as an environmental risk factor for AD.",

Among these compounds, 1-(5-amino-4-(2-chloro-7-methoxyquinolin-3-yl)-2-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-4H-pyrano [2,3-b]quinolin-3-yl)ethanone (9) and ethyl 5-amino-4-(2-chloroquinolin-3-yl)-2-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-4H-pyrano[2,3-b]quinoline-3-carboxylate (4) were found to be non-neurotoxic agents in human neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cells. Compounds 9 (IC50 = 0.47 +- 0.13 muM) and 4 (IC50 = 0.48 +- 0.05 muM) are potent, mixed-type (9: Ki = 0.0142 +- 0.003 muM), and selective EeAChE inhibitors, binding at the both catalytic and peripheral anionic site of the enzyme. Compounds 9 and 4 are neuroprotective agents at low muM concentrations upon decreased viability of SHSY5Y cells induced by oxidative stress, and stimulators of GSK3beta-dependent tau phosphorylation. In addition, molecules 9 and 4 effectively counteract Abeta-aggregation on exposure to Abeta1-40, as well as Abeta1-40 aggregation-dependent tau-oligomerization and phosphorylation in (396)Ser, which could be ascribed to the anti-aggregating properties shown in vitro. Thus, a new family of tacrine analogues, whose potent AChEI activity is linked to both their Abeta-aggregating and tau-phosphorylation inhibitory capacities, has been discovered for the potential treatment of AD.",

In the present study, we examined sodium arsenite (1, 5, 10, 100nM) effects on contextual and tone memory of male rats in Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm alone and in co-administration with beta-amyloid. We detected changes in the level of caspase-3, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB), cAMP response element-binding (CREB), heme oxygenase-1 and NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) by Western blot. Sodium arsenite in high doses induced significant memory impairment 9 and 16days after infusion. By contrast, low doses of sodium arsenite attenuate memory deficit in Abeta injected rats after 16days. Our data revealed that treatment with high concentration of sodium arsenite increased caspase-3 cleavage and NF-kappaB level, 9days after injection. Whereas, low doses of sodium arsenite cause Nrf2 and HO-1 activation and increased CREB phosphorylation in the hippocampus. These findings suggest the concentration dependent effects of sodium arsenite on contextual and tone memory. Moreover, it seems that the neuroprotective effects of ultra-low concentrations of sodium arsenite on Abeta-induced memory impairment is mediated via an increase Nrf2, HO-1 and CREB phosphorylation levels and decrease caspase-3 and NF-kappaB amount.",

However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the pathologic accumulation of oligomers are unclear, and the exact structural composition of oligomers is being debated. Using targeted and quantitative mass spectrometry, we reveal site-specific Abeta autocleavage during the early phase of aggregation, producing a typical Abeta fragment signature and that truncated Abeta peptides can form stable oligomeric complexes with full-length Abeta peptide. We show that the use of novel anti-Abeta antibodies raised against these truncated Abeta isoforms allows for monitoring and targeting the accumulation of truncated Abeta fragments. Antibody-enabled screening of transgenic models of AD as well as human postmortem brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid revealed that aggregation-associated Abeta cleavage is a highly relevant clinical feature of AD.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers are recognized as the primary neurotoxic agents in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Impaired brain energy metabolism and oxidative stress are implicated in cognitive decline in AD. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)), a coenzyme involved in redox activities in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, has been identified as a key regulator of the lifespan-extending effects, and the activation of NAD(+) expression has been linked with a decrease in Abeta toxicity in AD. One of the key precursors of NAD(+) is nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a product of the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase reaction. To determine whether improving brain energy metabolism will forestall disease progress in AD, the impact of the NAD(+) precursor NMN on Abeta oligomer-induced neuronal death and cognitive impairment were studied in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHCs) and in a rat model of AD. Treatment of intracerebroventricular Abeta oligomer infusion AD model rats with NMN (500mg/kg, intraperitoneally) sustained improvement in cognitive function as assessed by the Morris water maze. In OHCs, Abeta oligomer-treated culture media with NMN attenuated neuronal cell death. NMN treatment also significantly prevented the Abeta oligomer-induced inhibition of LTP. Furthermore, NMN restored levels of NAD(+) and ATP, eliminated accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the Abeta oligomer-treated hippocampal slices. All these protective effects were reversed by 3-acetylpyridine, which generates inactive NAD(+). The present study indicates that NMN could restore cognition in AD model rats. The beneficial effect of NMN is produced by ameliorating neuron survival, improving energy metabolism and reducing ROS accumulation. These results suggest that NMN may become a promising therapeutic drug for AD.",

Recent experimental studies have emphasized the role of the fibril as a catalytic surface for the production of highly toxic oligomers during secondary nucleation. By using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that it is the hydrophobic fibril region that causes the structural changes required for catalyzing the formation of beta-sheet-rich Abeta1-42 oligomers on the fibril surface.

Analyzing molecular dynamics simulations we comment on the relative weight of the new fibril structure and present evidence that its stability depends on hydrophobic contacts involving the C-terminal residues I41 and A42, but not on the salt bridge K28-A42.

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta accumulation into insoluble plaques (Abetap) is known to play a significant role in the pathological process in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The presence of Abetap is also one of the neuropathological hallmarks for the disease. AD final diagnosis is generally acknowledged after the evaluation of Abetap deposition in the brain. Insoluble Abetap accumulation may also concur to cause AD as postulated in the so-called amyloid hypothesis. Therefore, the visualization, evaluation and quantification of Abetap are nowadays the keys for a better understanding of the disease, which may point to a possible cure for AD in the near future. Synchrotron-based X-ray phase contrast (XPC) has been demonstrated as the only imaging method that can retrieve the Abetap signal with high spatial resolution (up to 10 microm), high sensitivity and three-dimensional information at the same time. Although at the moment XPC is suitable for ex vivo samples only, it may develop into an alternative to positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in Abetap imaging. In this contribution the possibility of using synchrotron-based X-ray phase propagation computed tomography to visualize and measure Abetap on mouse brains is presented. A careful setup optimization for this application leads to a significant improvement of spatial resolution (~1 microm), data acquisition speed (five times faster), X-ray dose (five times lower) and setup complexity, without a substantial loss in sensitivity when compared with the classic implementation of grating-based X-ray interferometry.",

Substantial evidences indicate that there is over-activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis in AD. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of NVP-BEZ235 (BEZ; dactolisib), a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor that is under phase I/II clinical trials for the treatment of some types of cancer, in hippocampal neuronal cultures stimulated with amyloid-beta (Abeta) 1-42 and in mice injected with Abeta 1-42 in the hippocampus. In cell cultures, BEZ reduced neuronal death induced by Abeta. BEZ, but not rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor, or LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor that also inhibits mTOR, reduced the memory impairment induced by Abeta. The effect induced by Abeta was also prevented in PI3Kgamma(-/-) mice. Neuronal death and microgliosis induced by Abeta were reduced by BEZ. In addition, the compound increased IL-10 and TNF-alpha levels in the hippocampus. Finally, BEZ did not change the phosphorylation of Akt and p70s6K, suggesting that the involvement of PI3K and mTOR in the effects induced by BEZ remains controversial. Therefore, BEZ represents a potential strategy to prevent the pathological outcomes induced by Abeta and should be investigated in other models of neurodegenerative conditions.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in the brain plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although osthole has been shown to neuroprotective activity in AD, the exact molecular mechanism of its neuroprotective effects has not yet been fully elucidated. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to regulate multiple aspects of AD development and progression, indicating that targeting miRNAs could be a novel strategy to treat AD. In the current study, we investigated whether a natural coumarin derivative osthole could up-regulate miR-107, resulting in facilitating the cells survival, reducing LDH leakage, inhibiting apoptosis and reducing beta amyloid (Abeta) production in AD. We found that osthole treatment significantly up-regulate miR-107 expression and inhibited BACE1, one of the targets of miR-107. Administration of osthole to APP/PS1 transgenic mice resulted in a significant improvement in learning and memory function, which was associated with a significant a decrease in Abeta in the hippocampal and cortex region of the brain. Our findings demonstrated that osthole plays a neuroprotective activity role in part through up-regulate miR-107 in AD.",

As additional chemical structures were investigated, the heterogeneity of ligand-binding sites became apparent, as did discrepancies in binding of some ligands between human disease and animal models. These differences and their implications have received little attention. This review discusses the impact of different ligand-binding sites and misfolded protein conformational polymorphism on the interpretation of imaging data acquired with different ligands. Investigation of the differences in binding in animal models may identify pathologic processes informing improvements to these models for more faithful recapitulation of this uniquely human disease. The differential selectivity for binding of particular ligands to different conformational states could potentially be harnessed to better define disease progression and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "It has now been ~ 30 years since the Alzheimer's disease (AD) research entered what may be termed the 'molecular era' that began with the identification of the amyloid beta protein (Abeta) as the primary component of amyloid within senile plaques and cerebrovascular amyloid and the microtubule-associated protein tau as the primary component of neurofibrillary tangles in the AD brain. These pivotal discoveries and the subsequent genetic, pathological, and modeling studies supporting pivotal roles for tau and Abeta aggregation and accumulation have provided firm rationale for a new generation of AD therapies designed not to just provide symptomatic benefit, but as disease modifying agents that would slow or even reverse the disease course. Indeed, over the last 20 years numerous therapeutic strategies for disease modification have emerged, been preclinically validated, and advanced through various stages of clinical testing. Unfortunately, no therapy has yet to show significant clinical disease modification. In this review, I describe 10 translational barriers to successful disease modification, highlight current efforts addressing some of these barriers, and discuss how the field could focus future efforts to overcome barriers that are not major foci of current research efforts.

    "abstract": "In this work, ceria doped ZnO nanomaterials with flower-structure (Ce:ZONFs) were prepared to construct a luminol-based electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunosensor for amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) detection. Herein, carboxyl groups (-COOH) covered Ce:ZONFs were synthesized by a green method with lysine as reductant. After that, Ce:ZONFs-based ECL nanocomposite was prepared by combining the luminophore of luminol and Ce:ZONFs via amidation and physical absorption. Luminol modified on Ce:ZONFs surface could generate a strong ECL signal under the assistance of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) (such as OH( ) and O2( -)), which were produced by a catalytic reaction between Ce:ZONFs and H2O2. It was worth noticing that a quick Ce(4+)   Ce(3+) reaction in this doped material could increase the rate of electron transfer to realize the signal amplification. Subsequently, the luminol functionalized Ce:ZONFs (Ce:ZONFs-Lum) were covered by secondary antibody (Ab2) and glucose oxidase (GOD), respectively, to construct a novel Ab2 bioconjugate (Ab2-GOD@Ce:ZONFs-Lum). The wire-structured silver-cysteine complex (AgCys NWs) with a large number of -COOH, which was synthesized by AgNO3 and l-cysteine, was used as substrate of the immunosensor to capture the primary antibody (Ab1). Under the optimal conditions, this proposed ECL immunosensor had exhibited high sensitivity for Abeta detection with a wide linear range from 80 fg/mL to 100 ng/mL and an ultralow detection limit of 52 fg/mL. Meanwhile, this biosensor had good specificity for Abeta, indicating that the provided strategy had a promising potential in the detection of Abeta.",

The building up of toxic oligomeric and fibrillar amyloid aggregates in the brain plays host to a downstream of events, causing damage to axons, dendrites, synapses, signaling, transmission, and finally cell death. Herein, we introduce a novel conjugated polymer (CP), hydroxyquinoline appended polyfluorene (PF-HQ), which has a typical \"amyloid like\" surface motif and exhibits inhibitory modulation effect on amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation. We delineate inhibitory effects of PF-HQ based on Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, atomic force microscopy (AFM), circular dichroism (CD), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) studies. The amyloid-like PF-HQ forms nano coaggregates by templating with toxic amyloid intermediates and displays improved inhibitory impacts toward Abeta fibrillation and diminishes amyloid cytotoxicity. We have developed a CP based modulation strategy for the first time, which demonstrates beneficiary amyloid-like surface motif to interact efficiently with the protein, the pendant side groups to trap the toxic amyloid intermediates as well as optical signal to acquire the mechanistic insight.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein (apo) E4 is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanism by which it causes cognitive decline is unclear. In knockin (KI) mice, human apoE4 causes age-dependent learning and memory impairments and degeneration of GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Here we report two functional apoE4-KI phenotypes involving sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), hippocampal network events critical for memory processes. Aged apoE4-KI mice had fewer SWRs than apoE3-KI mice and significantly reduced slow gamma activity during SWRs. Elimination of apoE4 in GABAergic interneurons, which prevents learning and memory impairments, rescued SWR-associated slow gamma activity but not SWR abundance in aged mice. SWR abundance was reduced similarly in young and aged apoE4-KI mice; however, the full SWR-associated slow gamma deficit emerged only in aged apoE4-KI mice. These results suggest that progressive decline of interneuron-enabled slow gamma activity during SWRs critically contributes to apoE4-mediated learning and memory impairments. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",

    "title": "High-speed atomic force microscopy reveals structural dynamics of amyloid beta1-42 aggregates.",
    "abstract": "Aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins into insoluble amyloid fibrils is implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases. This process involves protein assembly into oligomeric intermediates and fibrils with highly polymorphic molecular structures. These structural differences may be responsible for different disease presentations. For this reason, elucidation of the structural features and assembly kinetics of amyloidogenic proteins has been an area of intense study. We report here the results of high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) studies of fibril formation and elongation by the 42-residue form of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta1-42), a key pathogenetic agent of Alzheimer's disease. Our data demonstrate two different growth modes of Abeta1-42, one producing straight fibrils and the other producing spiral fibrils. Each mode depends on initial fibril nucleus structure, but switching from one growth mode to another was occasionally observed, suggesting that fibril end structure fluctuated between the two growth modes. This switching phenomenon was affected by buffer salt composition. Our findings indicate that polymorphism in fibril structure can occur after fibril nucleation and is affected by relatively modest changes in environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bapineuzumab, an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody, was evaluated as a candidate for immunotherapy in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the treatment effect of bapineuzumab therapy on disease-relevant biomarkers in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, using exposure-response modeling. METHODS: Biomarker data from two Phase III studies were combined to model the impact of bapineuzumab exposure on week-71 change from baseline in brain amyloid burden by 11C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET imaging (global cortical average of the Standardized Uptake Value ratio values), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated (p)-tau concentrations, and brain volumetrics (brain boundary shift integral) by magnetic resonance imaging. Bapineuzumab or placebo was administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion every 13 weeks for 78 weeks. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling helped determine the most appropriate exposure-response model and estimate the impact of disease-relevant covariates (baseline biomarker value, APOE*E4 allele copy number, and baseline disease status as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination score) on the three biomarkers. RESULTS: Linear exposure-response relationships with negative and significant slope terms were observed for PiB PET and CSF p-tau concentration. Baseline biomarker value and APOE*E4 carrier status were significant covariates for both biomarkers. No exposure-response relationship on brain boundary shift integral was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Bapineuzumab treatment induced exposure-dependent reductions in brain amyloid burden. Effects on CSF p-tau concentrations were significant only in APOE*E4 carriers. No apparent influence of bapineuzumab exposure on brain volume could be demonstrated.",

    "title": "Improved Neuroprotection Provided by Drug Combination in Neurons Exposed to Cell-Derived Soluble Amyloid-beta Peptide.",
    "abstract": "Oligomeric amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide contributes to impaired synaptic connections and neurodegenerative processes, and as such, represents a primary therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD)-modifying approaches. However, the lack of efficacy of drugs that inhibit production of Abeta demonstrates the need for a better characterization of its toxic effects, both on synaptic and neuronal function. Here, we used conditioned medium obtained from recombinant HEK-AbetaPP cells expressing the human amyloid-beta protein precursor (Abeta-CM), to investigate Abeta-induced neurotoxic and synaptotoxic effects. Characterization of Abeta-CM revealed that it contained picomolar amounts of cell-secreted Abeta in its soluble form. Incubation of primary cortical neurons with Abeta-CM led to significant decreases in synaptic protein levels as compared to controls. This effect was no longer observed in neurons incubated with conditioned medium obtained from HEK-AbetaPP cells grown in presence of the gamma-secretase inhibitor, Semagacestat or LY450139 (LY-CM). However, neurotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects of Abeta-CM were only partially prevented using LY-CM, which could be explained by other deleterious compounds related to chronic oxidative stress that were released by HEK-AbetaPP cells. Indeed, full neuroprotection was observed in cells exposed to LY-CM by additional treatment with the antioxidant resveratrol, or with the pluripotent n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid. Inhibition of Abeta production appeared necessary but insufficient to prevent neurodegenerative effects associated with AD due to other neurotoxic compounds that could exert additional deleterious effects on neuronal function and survival. Therefore, association of various types of protective agents needs to be considered when developing strategies for AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive dementia disorder characterized by synaptic degeneration and amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation in the brain. Through whole-genome sequencing of 1345 individuals from 410 families with late-onset AD (LOAD), we identified three highly penetrant variants in PRKCA, the gene that encodes protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha), in five of the families. All three variants linked with LOAD displayed increased catalytic activity relative to wild-type PKCalpha as assessed in live-cell imaging experiments using a genetically encoded PKC activity reporter. Deleting PRKCA in mice or adding PKC antagonists to mouse hippocampal slices infected with a virus expressing the Abeta precursor CT100 revealed that PKCalpha was required for the reduced synaptic activity caused by Abeta. In PRKCA(-/-) neurons expressing CT100, introduction of PKCalpha, but not PKCalpha lacking a PDZ interaction moiety, rescued synaptic depression, suggesting that a scaffolding interaction bringing PKCalpha to the synapse is required for its mediation of the effects of Abeta. Thus, enhanced PKCalpha activity may contribute to AD, possibly by mediating the actions of Abeta on synapses. In contrast, reduced PKCalpha activity is implicated in cancer. Hence, these findings reinforce the importance of maintaining a careful balance in the activity of this enzyme.",

Herein, we report a protocol for the efficient solid-phase peptide synthesis of the N-terminally elongated Abeta-peptides Abeta-3-38 , Abeta-3-40 , and Abeta-3-42 . Biophysical characterization by NMR spectroscopy, CD spectroscopy, an aggregation assay, and electron microscopy revealed that all three peptides were prone to aggregation into amyloid fibrils. Immunoprecipitation, followed by mass spectrometry, indicated that Abeta-3-38 and Abeta-3-40 are generated by transfected cells even in the presence of a tripartite beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) inhibitor. The elongated Abeta peptides starting at Val(-3) can be separated from N-terminally-truncated Abeta forms by high-resolution isoelectric-focusing techniques, despite virtually identical isoelectric points.

    "abstract": "Beta-amyloid (Abeta), the hallmark protein in Alzheimer's disease (AD), induces neurotoxicity that involves oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to cell death. Carnosic acid (CA), a polyphenolic diterpene isolated from the herb rosemary (Rosemarinus officinalis), was investigated in our study to assess its neuroprotective effect and underlying mechanism against Abeta-induced injury in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. We found that CA pretreatment alleviated the Abeta25-35-induced loss of cell viability, inhibited both Abeta1-42 accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation, reduced reactive oxygen species generation, and maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, CA increased the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-II/I ratio and decreased SQSTM1(p62), indicating that CA could induce autophagy. Autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) attenuated the neuroprotective effect of CA, suggesting that autophagy was involved in the neuroprotection of CA. It was also observed that CA activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) but inhibited mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Furthermore, blocking AMPK with si-AMPKalpha successfully inhibited the upregulation of LC3-II/I, prevented the downregulation of phosphorylation of mTOR and SQSTM1(p62), indicating that CA induced autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells via the activation of AMPK. These results suggested that CA might be a potential agent for preventing AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by two molecular pathologies: cerebral beta-amyloidosis in the form of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques and tauopathy in the form of neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and neuropil threads. Until recently, only Abeta could be studied in humans using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging owing to a lack of tau PET imaging agents. Clinical pathological studies have linked tau pathology closely to the onset and progression of cognitive symptoms in patients with AD. We report PET imaging of tau and Abeta in a cohort of cognitively normal older adults and those with mild AD. Multivariate analyses identified unique disease-related stereotypical spatial patterns (topographies) for deposition of tau and Abeta. These PET imaging tau and Abeta topographies were spatially distinct but correlated with disease progression. Cerebrospinal fluid measures of tau, often used to stage preclinical AD, correlated with tau deposition in the temporal lobe. Tau deposition in the temporal lobe more closely tracked dementia status and was a better predictor of cognitive performance than Abeta deposition in any region of the brain. These data support models of AD where tau pathology closely tracks changes in brain function that are responsible for the onset of early symptoms in AD.",

    "title": "Ionic Strength Modulation of the Free Energy Landscape of Abeta40 Peptide Fibril Formation.",
    "abstract": "Protein misfolding and formation of cross-beta structured amyloid fibrils are linked to many neurodegenerative disorders. Although recently developed quantitative approaches have started to reveal the molecular nature of self-assembly and fibril formation of proteins and peptides, it is yet unclear how these self-organization events are precisely modulated by microenvironmental factors, which are known to strongly affect the macroscopic aggregation properties. Here, we characterize the explicit effect of ionic strength on the microscopic aggregation rates of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta40) self-association, implicated in Alzheimer's disease. We found that physiological ionic strength accelerates Abeta40 aggregation kinetics by promoting surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation reactions. This promoted catalytic effect can be assigned to shielding of electrostatic repulsion between monomers on the fibril surface or between the fibril surface itself and monomeric peptides. Furthermore, we observe the formation of two different beta-structured states with similar but distinct spectroscopic features, which can be assigned to an off-pathway immature state (Fbeta*) and a mature stable state (Fbeta), where salt favors formation of the Fbeta fibril morphology. Addition of salt to preformed Fbeta* accelerates transition to Fbeta, underlining the dynamic nature of Abeta40 fibrils in solution. On the basis of these results we suggest a model where salt decreases the free-energy barrier for Abeta40 folding to the Fbeta state, favoring the buildup of the mature fibril morphology while omitting competing, energetically less favorable structural states.",

BIN1 is a member of the amphiphysin family of proteins, and contains N-terminal Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs and C-terminal Src homology 3 domains. BIN1 is widely expressed in the mouse and human brains, and has been reported to function in the endocytosis and the endosomal sorting of membrane proteins. BACE1 is a type 1 transmembrane aspartyl protease expressed predominantly in neurons of the brain and responsible for the production of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). Here we report that the depletion of BIN1 increases cellular BACE1 levels through impaired endosomal trafficking and reduces BACE1 lysosomal degradation, resulting in increased Abeta production. Our findings provide a mechanistic role of BIN1 in the pathogenesis of AD as a novel genetic regulator of BACE1 levels and Abeta production.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) often coexists with Alzheimer's disease (AD). APOE4 is a strong genetic risk factor for both AD and CAA. Sex-dependent differences have been shown in AD as well as in cerebrovascular diseases. Therefore, we examined the effects of APOE4, sex, and pathological components on CAA in AD subjects. A total of 428 autopsied brain samples from pathologically confirmed AD cases were analyzed. CAA severity was histologically scored in inferior parietal, middle frontal, motor, superior temporal and visual cortexes. In addition, subgroups with severe CAA (n = 60) or without CAA (n = 39) were subjected to biochemical analysis of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and apolipoprotein E (apoE) by ELISA in the temporal cortex. After adjusting for age, Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage and Thal amyloid phase, we found that overall CAA scores were higher in males than females. Furthermore, carrying one or more APOE4 alleles was associated with higher overall CAA scores. Biochemical analysis revealed that the levels of detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble Abeta40, and insoluble apoE were significantly elevated in individuals with severe CAA or APOE4. The ratio of Abeta40/Abeta42 in insoluble fractions was also increased in the presence of CAA or APOE4, although it was negatively associated with male sex. Levels of insoluble Abeta40 were positively associated with those of insoluble apoE, which were strongly influenced by CAA status. Pertaining to insoluble Abeta42, the levels of apoE correlated regardless of CAA status. Our results indicate that sex and APOE genotypes differentially influence the presence and severity of CAA in AD, likely by affecting interaction and aggregation of Abeta40 and apoE.",

    "title": "Resveratrol Attenuates Abeta25-35 Caused Neurotoxicity by Inducing Autophagy Through the TyrRS-PARP1-SIRT1 Signaling Pathway.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) and loss of neurons. Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural polyphenol that has been found to be beneficial for AD through attenuation of Abeta-induced toxicity in neurons both in vivo and in vitro. However, the specific underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Recently, autophagy was found to protect neurons from toxicity injuries via degradation of impaired proteins and organelles. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the role of autophagy in the anti-neurotoxicity effect of RSV in PC12 cells. We found that RSV pretreatment suppressed beta-amyloid protein fragment 25-35 (Abeta25-35)-induced decrease in cell viability. Expression of light chain 3-II, degradation of sequestosome 1, and formation of autophagosomes were also upregulated by RSV. Suppression of autophagy by 3-methyladenine abolished the favorable effects of RSV on Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity. Furthermore, RSV promoted the expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), auto-poly-ADP-ribosylation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), as well as tyrosyl transfer-RNA (tRNA) synthetase (TyrRS). Nevertheless, RSV-mediated autophagy was markedly abolished with the addition of inhibitors of SIRT1 (EX527), nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (STF-118804), PARP1 (AG-14361), as well as SIRT1 and TyrRS small interfering RNA transfection, indicating that the action of RSV on autophagy induction was dependent on TyrRS, PARP1 and SIRT1. In conclusion, RSV attenuated neurotoxicity caused by Abeta25-35 through inducing autophagy in PC12 cells, and the autophagy was partially mediated via activation of the TyrRS-PARP1-SIRT1 signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Extra-cellular deposition including amyloid beta (Abeta) is a feature of retinal ageing. It has been documented for Bruch's membrane (BM) where Abeta is elevated in complement factor H knockout mice (Cfh(-/-)) proposed as a model for age related macular degeneration. However, arterial deposition in choroidal vessels prior to perfusion across BM has not been examined. Abeta is associated with tau phosphorylation and these are linked in blood vessels in Alzheimers Disease where they can drive perivascular pathology. Here we ask if Abeta, tau and phosphorylated tau are features of ageing in choroidal vessels in 12 month C57 BL/6 and Cfh(-/-) mice, using immune staining and Western blot analysis. Greater levels of Abeta and phosphorylated tau are found in choroidal vessels in Cfh(-/-) mice. Western blot revealed a 40% increase in Abeta in Cfh(-/-) over C57 BL/6 mice. Abeta deposits coat around 55% of the luminal wall in Cfh(-/-) compared to only about 40% in C57 BL/6. Total tau was similar in both groups, but phosphorylated tau increased by >100% in Cfh(-/-) compared to C57 BL/6 and covered >75% of the luminal wall compared to 50% in C57 BL/6. Hence, phosphorylated tau is a marked choroidal feature in this mouse model. Abeta deposition was clumped in Cfh(-/-) mice and likely to influence blood flow dynamics. Disturbed flow is associated with atherogenesis and may be related to the accumulation of membrane attack complex recently identified between choroidal vessels in those at high risk of macular degeneration due to complement factor H polymorphisms.",

    "title": "Neuropathologic Associations of Learning and Memory in Primary Progressive Aphasia.",
    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The dementia syndrome of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) can be caused by 1 of several neuropathologic entities, including forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) or Alzheimer disease (AD). Although episodic memory is initially spared in this syndrome, the subtle learning and memory features of PPA and their neuropathologic associations have not been characterized. OBJECTIVE: To detect subtle memory differences on the basis of autopsy-confirmed neuropathologic diagnoses in PPA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective analysis was conducted at the Northwestern Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease Center in August 2015 using clinical and postmortem autopsy data that had been collected between August 1983 and June 2012. Thirteen patients who had the primary clinical diagnosis of PPA and an autopsy-confirmed diagnosis of either AD (PPA-AD) or a tau variant of FTLD (PPA-FTLD) and 6 patients who had the clinical diagnosis of amnestic dementia and autopsy-confirmed AD (AMN-AD) were included. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Scores on the effortless learning, delayed retrieval, and retention conditions of the Three Words Three Shapes test, a specialized measure of verbal and nonverbal episodic memory. RESULTS: The PPA-FTLD (n = 6), PPA-AD (n = 7), and AMN-AD (n = 6) groups did not differ by demographic composition (all P > .05). The sample mean (SD) age was 64.1 (10.3) years at symptom onset and 67.9 (9.9) years at Three Words Three Shapes test administration. The PPA-FTLD group had normal (ie, near-ceiling) scores on all verbal and nonverbal test conditions. Both the PPA-AD and AMN-AD groups had deficits in verbal effortless learning (mean [SD] number of errors, 9.9 [4.6] and 14.2 [2.0], respectively) and verbal delayed retrieval (mean [SD] number of errors, 6.1 [5.9] and 12.0 [4.4], respectively). The AMN-AD group had additional deficits in nonverbal effortless learning (mean [SD] number of errors, 10.3 [4.0]) and verbal retention (mean [SD] number of errors, 8.33 [5.2]), which were not observed in the PPA-FTLD or PPA-AD groups (all P < .005). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study identified neuropathologic associations of learning and memory in autopsy-confirmed cases of PPA. Among patients with clinical PPA syndrome, AD neuropathology appeared to interfere with effortless learning and delayed retrieval of verbal information, whereas FTLD-tau pathology did not. The results provide directions for future research on the interactions between limbic and language networks.",

To investigate this, we used high-resolution confocal and super-resolution (STORM) microscopy in AD-like mice and human AD tissue. We found that microglia processes, rich in TREM2, tightly surround early amyloid fibrils and plaques promoting their compaction and insulation. In Trem2- or DAP12-haplodeficient mice and in humans with R47H TREM2 mutations, microglia had a markedly reduced ability to envelop amyloid deposits. This led to an increase in less compact plaques with longer and branched amyloid fibrils resulting in greater surface exposure to adjacent neurites. This was associated with more severe neuritic tau hyperphosphorylation and axonal dystrophy around amyloid deposits. Thus, TREM2 deficiency may disrupt the formation of a neuroprotective microglia barrier that regulates amyloid compaction and insulation. Pharmacological modulation of this barrier could be a novel therapeutic strategy for AD.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are physically and biochemically in contact with other organelles including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Such contacts are formed between mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM), specialized subregions of ER, and the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). We have previously shown increased expression of MAM-associated proteins and enhanced ER to mitochondria Ca(2+) transfer from ER to mitochondria in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta)-related neuronal models. Here, we report that siRNA knockdown of mitofusin-2 (Mfn2), a protein that is involved in the tethering of ER and mitochondria, leads to increased contact between the two organelles. Cells depleted in Mfn2 showed increased Ca(2+) transfer from ER to mitchondria and longer stretches of ER forming contacts with OMM. Interestingly, increased contact resulted in decreased concentrations of intra- and extracellular Abeta40 and Abeta42 . Analysis of gamma-secretase protein expression, maturation and activity revealed that the low Abeta concentrations were a result of impaired gamma-secretase complex function. Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 and neprilysin expression as well as neprilysin activity were not affected by Mfn2 siRNA treatment. In summary, our data shows that modulation of ER-mitochondria contact affects gamma-secretase activity and Abeta generation. Increased ER-mitochondria contact results in lower gamma-secretase activity suggesting a new mechanism by which Abeta generation can be controlled.",

Analyses of large autopsy series, biomarker studies, and genomics analyses have provided important insights about AD and shed light on previously unrecognized conditions, enabling a deeper understanding of neurodegenerative diseases in general. After demonstrating the importance of correct disease classification for AD and primary age-related tauopathy, we emphasize the public health impact of an underappreciated AD \"mimic,\" which has been termed \"hippocampal sclerosis of aging\" or \"hippocampal sclerosis dementia.\" This pathology affects >20% of individuals older than 85 years and is strongly associated with cognitive impairment. In this review, we provide an overview of current hypotheses about how genetic risk factors (GRN, TMEM106B, ABCC9, and KCNMB2), and other pathogenetic influences contribute to TDP-43 pathology and hippocampal sclerosis. Because hippocampal sclerosis of aging affects the \"oldest-old\" with arteriolosclerosis and TDP-43 pathologies that extend well beyond the hippocampus, more appropriate terminology for this disease is required. We recommend \"cerebral age-related TDP-43 and sclerosis\" (CARTS). A detailed case report is presented, which includes neuroimaging and longitudinal neurocognitive data. Finally, we suggest a neuropathology-based diagnostic rubric for CARTS.",

    "abstract": "The human amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42, structural modifications, from soluble monomers to fully formed fibrils through intermediate structures, were investigated, and the results were compared with those obtained for the inverse Abeta40-1 and Abeta42-1, mutant Abeta1-40Phe(10) and Abeta1-40Nle(35), and rat Abeta1-40Rat peptide sequences. The aggregation was followed at a slow rate, in chloride free media and room temperature, and revealed to be a sequence-structure process, dependent on the physicochemical properties of each Abeta peptide isoforms, and occurring at different rates and by different pathways. The fibrilization process was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), via changes in the adsorption morphology from: (i) initially random coiled structures of ~0.6 nm height, corresponding to the Abeta peptide monomers in random coil or in alpha-helix conformations, to (ii) aggregates and protofibrils of 1.5-6.0 nm height and (iii) two types of fibrils, corresponding to the Abeta peptide in a beta-sheet configuration. The reactivity of the carbon electrode surface was considered. The hydrophobic surface induced rapid changes of the Abeta peptide conformations, and differences between the adsorbed fibrils, formed at the carbon surface (beaded, thin, <2.0 nm height) or in solution (long, smooth, thick, >2.0 nm height), were detected. Differential pulse voltammetry showed that, according to their primary structure, the Abeta peptides undergo oxidation in one or two steps, the first step corresponding to the tyrosine amino acids oxidation, and the second one to the histidine and methionine amino acids oxidation. The fibrilization process was electrochemically detected via the decrease of the Abeta peptide oxidation peak currents that occurred in a time dependent manner.",

Several immunoassays for CSF Abeta1-42 are commercially available, but can suffer from between laboratory and batch-to-batch variability as well as lack of standardisation across assays. As a consequence, no general cut-off values have been established for a specific context of use (e.g., clinical diagnostics) and selection of individuals for enrolment in clinical trials (patient stratification) remains challenging. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) has initiated a working group for CSF proteins (WG-CSF) to facilitate standardisation of CSF Abeta1-42 measurement results. The efforts of the IFCC WG-CSF include the development of certified reference materials (CRMs) and reference measurement procedures (RMPs) for key biomarkers. Two candidate RMPs for quantification of Abeta1-42 in CSF based on liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry have been developed and tested in two ring trials. Furthermore, two commutability studies including native CSF pools, artificial CSF and spiked materials have been completed. On the basis of these studies, human CSF pools containing only endogenous Abeta1-42 at three concentrations were selected as the format for future CRMs that are now being processed.",

    "title": "Beer Drinking Associates with Lower Burden of Amyloid Beta Aggregation in the Brain: Helsinki Sudden Death Series.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Controversy surrounds the effect of alcohol consumption on the development of dementia and cognitive impairment. We investigated the association between consumption of different alcoholic beverages and beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation in the brain, 1 of the neuropathological lesions of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: In total, 125 males of the Helsinki Sudden Death autopsy Series were included with an age range at death 35 to 70 years. The consumption of alcohol, Abeta aggregation in the brain, and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype were assessed. Relatives answered a questionnaire to gather alcohol consumption history, and Abeta was visualized by implementing immunohistochemical staining of brain sections. Abeta immunoreactivity (IR) was assessed in a dichotomized (yes/no) fashion and as a stained area fraction (%). APOE genotype was assessed in DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded cardiac muscle samples. RESULTS: Increased age (p = 0.001; odds ratio [OR] = 1.09, confidence interval [CI] = 1.04 to 1.15) was associated with higher prevalence of Abeta-IR. Beer drinking decreased (p = 0.024; OR = 0.35, CI = 0.14 to 0.87) the prevalence of Abeta-IR and was associated with a significantly lower extent of Abeta-IR (p = 0.022). The amount of alcohol consumed was not linked with Abeta aggregation and neither was spirit nor wine consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Beer consumption may protect against Abeta aggregation in brain. Further studies are necessary to fully understand the effects of alcohol on Abeta pathology seen in brain tissue.",

    "title": "Effects of transthyretin on thyroxine and beta-amyloid removal from cerebrospinal fluid in mice.",
    "abstract": "Transthyretin (TTR) is a binding protein for the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4 ), retinol and beta-amyloid peptide. TTR aids the transfer of T4 from the blood to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but also prevents T4 loss from the blood-CSF barrier. It is, however, unclear whether TTR affects the clearance of beta-amyloid from the CSF. This study aimed to investigate roles of TTR in beta-amyloid and T4 efflux from the CSF. Eight-week-old 129sv male mice were anaesthetized and their lateral ventricles were cannulated. Mice were infused with artificial CSF containing (125) I-T4 /(3) H-mannitol, or (125) I-Abeta40/(3) H-inulin, in the presence or absence of TTR. Mice were decapitated at 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 minutes after injection. The whole brain was then removed and divided into different regions. The radioactivities in the brain were determined by liquid scintillation counting. At baseline, the net uptake of (125) I-T4 into the brain was significantly higher than that of (125) I-Abeta40, and the half time for efflux was shorter ((125) I-T4 , 5.16; (3) H-mannitol, 7.44; (125) I-Abeta40, 8.34; (3) H-inulin, 10.78 minutes). The presence of TTR increased the half time for efflux of (125) I-T4 efflux, and caused a noticeable increase in the uptake of (125) I-T4 and (125) I-Abeta40 in the choroid plexus, whilst uptakes of (3) H-mannitol and (3) H-inulin remained similar to control experiments. This study indicates that thyroxine and amyloid peptide effuse from the CSF using different transporters. TTR binds to thyroxine and amyloid peptide to prevent the loss of thyroxine from the brain and redistribute amyloid peptide to the choroid plexus.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a vascular dysfunction disorder characterized by deposits of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the walls of cerebral vessels. CAA and Abeta deposition in the brain parenchyma contribute to dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the contribution of platelets, which accumulate at vascular Abeta deposits, to CAA. We found that synthetic monomeric Abeta40 bound through its RHDS (Arg-His-Asp-Ser) sequence to integrin alphaIIbbeta3, which is the receptor for the extracellular matrix protein fibrinogen, and stimulated the secretion of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and the chaperone protein clusterin from platelets. Clusterin promoted the formation of fibrillar Abeta aggregates, and ADP acted through its receptors P2Y1 and P2Y12 on platelets to enhance integrin alphaIIbbeta3 activation, further increasing the secretion of clusterin and Abeta40 binding to platelets. Platelets from patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, a bleeding disorder in which platelets have little or dysfunctional alphaIIbbeta3, indicated that the abundance of this integrin dictated Abeta-induced clusterin release and platelet-induced Abeta aggregation. The antiplatelet agent clopidogrel, which irreversibly inhibits P2Y12, inhibited Abeta aggregation in platelet cultures; in transgenic AD model mice, this drug reduced the amount of clusterin in the circulation and the incidence of CAA. Our findings indicate that activated platelets directly contribute to CAA by promoting the formation of Abeta aggregates and that Abeta, in turn, activates platelets, creating a feed-forward loop. Thus, antiplatelet therapy may alleviate fibril formation in cerebral vessels of AD patients.",

METHODS: A total of 129 postmortem human brain samples were analyzed in brain regional specific manner exploring their associations with morphologic changes and cognitive decline. RESULTS: We have observed robust changes reflecting synaptic dysfunction in all studied dementia groups. There were significant associations between the rate of cognitive decline and decreased levels of Rab3 in DLB in the inferior parietal lobe and SNAP25 in AD in the prefrontal cortex. Of particular note, synaptic proteins significantly discriminated between dementia cases and controls with over 90% sensitivity and specificity. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that the proposition that synaptic markers can predict cognitive decline in AD, should be extended to Lewy body diseases.",

We present in vivo data showing that Abeta expression protects against fungal and bacterial infections in mouse, nematode, and cell culture models of AD. We show that Abeta oligomerization, a behavior traditionally viewed as intrinsically pathological, may be necessary for the antimicrobial activities of the peptide. Collectively, our data are consistent with a model in which soluble Abeta oligomers first bind to microbial cell wall carbohydrates via a heparin-binding domain. Developing protofibrils inhibited pathogen adhesion to host cells. Propagating beta-amyloid fibrils mediate agglutination and eventual entrapment of unatttached microbes. Consistent with our model, Salmonella Typhimurium bacterial infection of the brains of transgenic 5XFAD mice resulted in rapid seeding and accelerated beta-amyloid deposition, which closely colocalized with the invading bacteria. Our findings raise the intriguing possibility that beta-amyloid may play a protective role in innate immunity and infectious or sterile inflammatory stimuli may drive amyloidosis. These data suggest a dual protective/damaging role for Abeta, as has been described for other antimicrobial peptides.",

METHODS: Participants were from The 90+ Study, a population-based study of people 90 years and older. Dementia diagnoses were assigned postmortem during a consensus conference. Microinfarcts were evaluated in six brain regions. RESULTS: At death, the 213 participants were on average 97 years old, 69% were women, and 52% had dementia. Of the participants, 51% had microinfarcts and 17% had 3+ microinfarcts. The odds ratio (OR) for dementia was similar for 3+ microinfarcts (OR = 4.75, P < .01) and tangle stage V-VI (OR = 4.70, P < .001). Only microinfarcts in cortical regions (other than occipital) were associated to dementia. DISCUSSION: In this oldest-old cohort, microinfarcts are common and contribute independently and similarly in magnitude to dementia as tangles. As risk factors for microinfarcts and other dementing pathologies are likely to differ, identifying these factors is crucial to developing prevention strategies for dementia in the oldest-old.",

    "title": "Rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) is increased in Alzheimer's disease and ROCK1 depletion reduces amyloid-beta levels in brain.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and mitigating amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels may serve as a rational therapeutic avenue to slow AD progression. Pharmacologic inhibition of the Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCK1 and ROCK2) is proposed to curb Abeta levels, and mechanisms that underlie ROCK2's effects on Abeta production are defined. How ROCK1 affects Abeta generation remains a critical barrier. Here, we report that ROCK1 protein levels were elevated in mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI) and AD brains compared to controls. Abeta42 oligomers marginally increased ROCK1 and ROCK2 protein levels in neurons but strongly induced phosphorylation of Lim kinase 1 (LIMK1), suggesting that Abeta42 activates ROCKs. RNAi depletion of ROCK1 or ROCK2 suppressed endogenous Abeta40 production in neurons, and Abeta40 levels were reduced in brains of ROCK1 heterozygous knock-out mice compared to wild-type littermate controls. ROCK1 knockdown decreased amyloid precursor protein (APP), and treatment with bafilomycin accumulated APP levels in neurons depleted of ROCK1. These observations suggest that reduction of ROCK1 diminishes Abeta levels by enhancing APP protein degradation. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that both ROCK1 and ROCK2 are therapeutic targets to combat Abeta production in AD. Mitigating amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels is a rational strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment, however, therapeutic targets with clinically available drugs are lacking. We hypothesize that Abeta accumulation in mild cognitive impairment because of AD (MCI) and AD activates the RhoA/ROCK pathway which in turn fuels production of Abeta. Escalation of this cycle over the course of many years may contribute to the buildup of amyloid pathology in MCI and/or AD.",

Using a prominent animal model of aspects of the disease, we here show using clinically relevant methodologies that very young, pre-pathological PDAPP mice, which overexpress mutant human amyloid precursor protein in the brain, exhibit two cryptic deficits that are normally undetected using standard methods of assessment. Despite learning a spatial memory task normally and displaying normal brain glucose uptake, they display faster forgetting after a long delay following performance to a criterion, together with a strong impairment of brain glucose uptake at the time of attempted memory retrieval. Preliminary observations suggest that these deficits, likely caused by an impairment in systems consolidation, could be rescued by immunotherapy with an anti-beta-amyloid antibody. Our data suggest a biomarker strategy for the early detection of beta-amyloid-related abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration is characterized by the ubiquitous presence of modifications in protein deposits. Despite their potential significance in the initiation and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, the effects of posttranslational modifications on the molecular properties of protein aggregates are largely unknown. Here, we study the Alzheimer disease-related amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and investigate how phosphorylation at serine 8 affects the structure of Abeta aggregates. Serine 8 is shown to be located in a region of high conformational flexibility in monomeric Abeta, which upon phosphorylation undergoes changes in local conformational dynamics. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange NMR and fluorescence quenching techniques, we demonstrate that Abeta phosphorylation at serine 8 causes structural changes in the N-terminal region of Abeta aggregates in favor of less compact conformations. Structural changes induced by serine 8 phosphorylation can provide a mechanistic link between phosphorylation and other biological events that involve the N-terminal region of Abeta aggregates. Our data therefore support an important role of posttranslational modifications in the structural polymorphism of amyloid aggregates and their modulatory effect on neurodegeneration.",

In order to augment our knowledge about the amyloid-beta (Abeta) isoforms present in both transgenic mouse models, we have developed two chromatographic methods, one acidic and the other basic, for the characterization of the Abeta species produced in the brains of the two transgenic mouse models. After immunoprecipitation and micro-liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry, 10 species of Abeta, surprisingly all of human origin, were detected in the brain of Tg2576 mouse, whereas 39 species, of both murine and human origin, were detected in the brain of the APP/PS1 mouse. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing the identification of such a high number of Abeta species in the brain of the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse, whereas, in contrast, a much lower number of Abeta species were identified in the Tg2576 mouse.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) reflects the presence of amyloidopathy in brains of subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To qualify the use of Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 for improvement of standard operating procedures (SOP) for measurement of CSF Abeta with a focus on CSF collection, storage, and analysis. METHODS: Euroimmun ELISAs for CSF Abeta isoforms were used to set up a SOP with respect to recipient properties (low binding, polypropylene), volume of tubes, freeze/thaw cycles, addition of detergents (Triton X-100, Tween-20) in collection or storage tubes or during CSF analysis. Data were analyzed with linear repeated measures and mixed effects models. RESULTS: Optimization of CSF analysis included a pre-wash of recipients (e.g., tubes, 96-well plates) before sample analysis. Using the Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio, in contrast to Abeta1-42, eliminated effects of tube type, additional freeze/thaw cycles, or effect of CSF volumes for polypropylene storage tubes. 'Low binding' tubes reduced the loss of Abeta when aliquoting CSF or in function of additional freeze/thaw cycles. Addition of detergent in CSF collection tubes resulted in an almost complete absence of variation in function of collection procedures, but affected the concentration of Abeta isoforms in the immunoassay. CONCLUSION: The ratio of Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 is a more robust biomarker than Abeta1-42 toward (pre-) analytical interfering factors. Further, 'low binding' recipients and addition of detergent in collection tubes are able to remove effects of SOP-related confounding factors. Integration of the Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio and 'low-binding tubes' into guidance criteria may speed up worldwide standardization of CSF biomarker analysis.",

    "title": "Conformational selection in amyloid-based immunotherapy: Survey of crystal structures of antibody-amyloid complexes.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The dominant feature in neurodegenerative diseases is protein aggregations that lead to neuronal loss. Immunotherapies using antibodies or antibody fragments to target the aggregations are a highly perused approach. The molecular mechanisms underlying the amyloid-based immunotherapy are complex. Deciphering the properties of amyloidogenic proteins responsible for these diseases is essential to obtain insights into antibody recognition of the amyloid antigens. SCOPE OF REVIEW: We systematically explore all available crystal structures of antibody-amyloid complexes related to neurodegenerative diseases, including antibodies that recognize the Abeta peptide, tau protein, prion protein, alpha-synuclein, huntingtin protein (mHTT), and polyglutamine. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: We found that antibodies mostly use the conformational selection mechanism to recognize the highly flexible amyloid antigens. In particular, solanezumab bound to Abeta12-28 tripeptide motif conformation (F19F20A21), which is shared with the Abeta42 fibril. This motif, which is trapped by the antibody, may provide the missing link in amyloid formation. Water molecules often bridge between the antibody and amyloid, contributing to the recognition. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This paper provides the structural basis for antibody recognition of amyloidogenic proteins. The analysis and discussion of known structures are expected to help in the design and optimization of antibodies in neurodegenerative diseases.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hericium erinaceus (HE) is a well-known mushroom in traditional Chinese food and medicine. HE extracts from the fruiting body and mycelia not only exhibit immunomodulatory, antimutagenic and antitumor activity but also have neuroprotective properties. Here, we purified HE polysaccharides (HEPS), composed of two high molecular weight polysaccharides (1.7 x 10(5) Da and 1.1 x 10(5) Da), and evaluated their protective effects on amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. METHODS: HEPS were prepared and purified using a 95 % ethanol extraction method. The components of HEPS were analyzed and the molecular weights of the polysaccharides were determined using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The neuroprotective effects of the polysaccharides were evaluated through a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay and an MTT assay and by quantifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potentials (MMP) of Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in cells. RESULT: Our results showed that 250 mug/ml HEPS was harmless and promoted cell viability with 1.2 muM Abeta treatment. We observed that the free radical scavenging rate exceeded 90 % when the concentration of HEPS was higher than 1 mg/mL in cells. The HEPS decreased the production of ROS from 80 to 58 % in a dose-dependent manner. Cell pretreatment with 250 mug/mL HEPS significantly reduced Abeta-induced high MMPs from 74 to 51 % and 94 to 62 % at 24 and 48 h, respectively. Finally, 250 mug/mL of HEPS prevented Abeta-induced cell shrinkage and nuclear degradation of PC12 cells. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that HEPS exhibit antioxidant and neuroprotective effects on Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in neurons.",

    "title": "Association of Cerebral Microbleeds With Cognitive Decline and Dementia.",
    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Cerebral microbleeds are hypothesized downstream markers of brain damage caused by vascular and amyloid pathologic mechanisms. To date, whether their presence is associated with cognitive deterioration in the general population remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether microbleeds, and more specifically microbleed count and location, are associated with an increased risk for cognitive impairment and dementia in the general population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based study set in the general community, assessed the presence, number, and location of microbleeds at baseline (August 2005 to December 2011) on magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain in 4841 participants 45 years or older. Participants underwent neuropsychological testing at 2 points a mean (SD) of 5.9 (0.6) years apart and were followed up for incident dementia throughout the study period until January 1, 2013. The association of microbleeds with cognitive decline and dementia was studied using multiple linear regression, linear mixed-effects modeling, and Cox proportional hazards. EXPOSURES: Cerebral microbleed presence, location, and number. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cognitive decline measured by a decrease in neuropsychological test battery scores (Mini-Mental State Examination, Letter Digit Substitution Task, Word Fluency Test, Stroop test, 15-word Verbal Learning Test, and Purdue Pegboard Test) and compound scores (eg, G factor, executive function, information processing speed, memory, motor speed) and dementia. RESULTS: In total, 3257 participants (1758 women [54.7%]; mean [SD] age, 59.6 [7.8] years) underwent baseline and follow-up cognitive testing. Microbleed prevalence was 15.3% (median [interquartile range] count, 1 [1-88]). The presence of more than 4 microbleeds was associated with cognitive decline. Lobar (with or without cerebellar) microbleeds were associated with a decline in executive functions (mean difference in z score, -0.31; 95% CI, -0.51 to -0.11; P = .003), information processing (mean difference in z score, -0.44; 95% CI, -0.65 to -0.22; P < .001), and memory function (mean difference in z score, -0.34; 95% CI, -0.64 to -0.03; P = .03), whereas microbleeds in other brain regions were associated with a decline in information processing and motor speed (mean difference in z score, -0.61; 95% CI, -1.05 to -0.17; P = .007). After a mean (SD) follow-up of 4.8 (1.4) years, 72 participants developed dementia, of whom 53 had Alzheimer dementia. The presence of microbleeds was associated with an increased risk for dementia after adjustment for age, sex, and educational level (hazard ratio, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.25-3.24), including Alzheimer dementia (hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.21-3.64). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the general population, a high microbleed count was associated with an increased risk for cognitive deterioration and dementia. Microbleeds thus mark the presence of diffuse vascular and neurodegenerative brain damage.",

Understanding the mechanism of APP cleavage and development of a convenient tool for the accurate evaluation of APP cleavage intensity by secretases are very important in the development of new AD therapeutic targets. In this study, we developed a sophisticated technology to evaluate the APP cleavage mechanism at the nano-molecular level by atomic force microscopic (AFM) nanolithography. APP was modified on a glass substrate; nanolithography of APP cleavage by beta-secretase-modified AFM probe scanning was achieved. APP cleavage was verified by the AFM imaging and the fluorescent immunostaining. The present method will be very useful in understanding the molecular level of the APP cleavage mechanism by beta-secretase in vitro; this method will facilitate inhibitor screening for the therapeutic target of AD.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) comprise fibrillar amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides as well as non-protein factors including glycosaminoglycan (GAG) polysaccharides. GAGs affect the kinetics and pathway of Abeta self-assembly and can impede fibril clearance; thus, they may be accessory molecules in AD. Here we report the first high-resolution details of GAG-Abeta fibril interactions from the perspective of the saccharide. Binding analysis indicated that the GAG proxy heparin has a remarkably high affinity for Abeta fibrils with 3-fold cross-sectional symmetry (3Q). Chemical synthesis of a uniformly (13)C-labeled octasaccharide heparin analogue enabled magic-angle spinning solid-state NMR of the GAG bound to 3Q fibrils, and measurements of dynamics revealed a tight complex in which all saccharide residues are restrained without undergoing substantial conformational changes. Intramolecular (13)C-(15)N dipolar dephasing is consistent with close (<5 A) contact between GAG anomeric position(s) and one or more histidine residues in the fibrils. These data provide a detailed model for the interaction between 3Q-seeded Abeta40 fibrils and a major non-protein component of AD plaques, and they reveal that GAG-amyloid interactions display a range of affinities that critically depend on the precise details of the fibril architecture.",

The oligomer formation process of Abeta and even that of Abeta fragments are still poorly understood, though understanding of these processes is essential for remedying Alzheimer's disease. In order to better understand the oligomerization process of the C-terminal Abeta fragment Abeta(29-42) at the atomic level, we performed the Hamiltonian replica-permutation molecular dynamics simulation with Abeta(29-42) molecules using the explicit water solvent model. We observed that oligomers increased in size through the sequential addition of monomers to the oligomer, rather than through the assembly of small oligomers. Moreover, solvent effects played an important role in this oligomerization process.",

To monitor such treatments, fluid biomarkers reflecting the underlying disease process are crucial. We found robust increases of neurofilament light chain (NfL) in CSF and blood in murine models of alpha-synucleinopathies, tauopathy, and beta-amyloidosis. Blood and CSF NfL levels were strongly correlated, and NfL increases coincided with the onset and progression of the corresponding proteopathic lesions in brain. Experimental induction of alpha-synuclein lesions increased CSF and blood NfL levels, while blocking Abeta lesions attenuated the NfL increase. Consistently, we also found NfL increases in CSF and blood of human alpha-synucleinopathies, tauopathies, and Alzheimer's disease. Our results suggest that CSF and particularly blood NfL can serve as a reliable and easily accessible biomarker to monitor disease progression and treatment response in mouse models and potentially in human proteopathic neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "gamma-Secretases are a family of intramembrane-cleaving proteases involved in various signaling pathways and diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cells co-express differing gamma-secretase complexes, including two homologous presenilins (PSENs). We examined the significance of this heterogeneity and identified a unique motif in PSEN2 that directs this gamma-secretase to late endosomes/lysosomes via a phosphorylation-dependent interaction with the AP-1 adaptor complex. Accordingly, PSEN2 selectively cleaves late endosomal/lysosomal localized substrates and generates the prominent pool of intracellular Abeta that contains longer Abeta; familial AD (FAD)-associated mutations in PSEN2 increased the levels of longer Abeta further. Moreover, a subset of FAD mutants in PSEN1, normally more broadly distributed in the cell, phenocopies PSEN2 and shifts its localization to late endosomes/lysosomes. Thus, localization of gamma-secretases determines substrate specificity, while FAD-causing mutations strongly enhance accumulation of aggregation-prone Abeta42 in intracellular acidic compartments. The findings reveal potentially important roles for specific intracellular, localized reactions contributing to AD pathogenesis.",

    "title": "An autoradiographic evaluation of AV-1451 Tau PET in dementia.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is essential to determine the specificity of AV-1451 PET for tau in brain imaging by using pathological comparisons. We performed autoradiography in autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative disorders to evaluate the specificity of AV-1451 binding for tau aggregates. METHODS: Tissue samples were selected that had a variety of dementia-related neuropathologies including Alzheimer disease, primary age-related tauopathy, tangle predominant dementia, non-Alzheimer disease tauopathies, frontotemporal dementia, parkinsonism, Lewy body disease and multiple system atrophy (n = 38). Brain tissue sections were stained for tau, TAR DNA-binding protein-43, and alpha-synuclein and compared to AV-1451 autoradiography on adjacent sections. RESULTS: AV-1451 preferentially localized to neurofibrillary tangles, with less binding to areas enriched in neuritic pathology and less mature tau. The strength of AV-1451 binding with respect to tau isoforms in various neurodegenerative disorders was: 3R + 4R tau (e.g., AD) > 3R tau (e.g., Pick disease) or 4R tau. Only minimal binding of AV-1451 to TAR DNA-binding protein-43 positive regions was detected. No binding of AV-1451 to alpha-synuclein was detected. \"Off-target\" binding was seen in vessels, iron-associated regions, substantia nigra, calcifications in the choroid plexus, and leptomeningeal melanin. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced AV-1451 binding in neuritic pathology compared to neurofibrillary tangles suggests that the maturity of tau pathology may affect AV-1451 binding and suggests complexity in AV-1451 binding. Poor association of AV-1451 with tauopathies that have preferential accumulation of either 4R tau or 3R tau suggests limited clinical utility in detecting these pathologies. In contrast, for disorders associated with 3R + 4R tau, such as Alzheimer disease, AV-1451 binds tau avidly but does not completely reflect the early stage tau progression suggested by Braak neurofibrillary tangle staging. AV-1451 binding to TAR DNA-binding protein-43 or TAR DNA-binding protein-43 positive regions can be weakly positive. Clinical use of AV-1451 will require a familiarity with distinct types of \"off-target\" binding.",

    "abstract": "By maintaining the Na(+) and K(+) transmembrane gradient mammalian Na,K-ATPase acts as a key regulator of neuronal electrotonic properties. Na,K-ATPase has an important role in synaptic transmission and memory formation. Accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) at the early stages of Alzheimer's disease is accompanied by reduction of Na,K-ATPase functional activity. The molecular mechanism behind this phenomenon is not known. Here we show that the monomeric Abeta(1-42) forms a tight (Kd of 3 muM), enthalpy-driven equimolar complex with alpha1beta1 Na,K-ATPase. The complex formation results in dose-dependent inhibition of the enzyme hydrolytic activity. The binding site of Abeta(1-42) is localized in the \"gap\" between the alpha- and beta-subunits of Na,K-ATPase, disrupting the enzyme functionality by preventing the subunits from shifting towards each other. Interaction of Na,K-ATPase with exogenous Abeta(1-42) leads to a pronounced decrease of the enzyme transport and hydrolytic activity and Src-kinase activation in neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y. This interaction allows regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity by short-term increase of the Abeta(1-42) level. However prolonged increase of Abeta(1-42) level under pathological conditions could lead to chronical inhibition of Na,K-ATPase and disruption of neuronal function. Taken together, our data suggest the role of beta-amyloid as a novel physiological regulator of Na,K-ATPase.",

    "abstract": "Multiple studies suggest that females are affected by Alzheimer disease (AD) more severely and more frequently than males. Other studies have failed to confirm this and the issue remains controversial. Difficulties include differences in study methods and male versus female life expectancy. Another element of uncertainty is that the majority of studies have lacked neuropathological confirmation of the AD diagnosis. We compared clinical and pathological AD severity in 1028 deceased subjects with full neuropathological examinations. The age of dementia onset did not differ by gender but females were more likely to proceed to very severe clinical and pathological disease, with significantly higher proportions having a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 5 or less and Braak stage VI neurofibrillary degeneration. Median neuritic plaque densities were similar in females and males with AD but females had significantly greater tangle density scores. In addition, we found that AD-control brain weight differences were significantly greater for females, even after adjustment for age, disease duration, and comorbid conditions. These findings suggest that when they are affected by AD, females progress more often to severe cognitive dysfunction, due to more severe neurofibrillary degeneration, and greater loss of brain parenchyma.",

The concentration dependence of amyloid formation by recombinant Abeta(1-40) peptide was studied using fluorescence spectroscopy and electron microscopy. We found that the process of amyloid formation is preceded by lag time, which indicates that the process is nucleation-dependent. Further exponential growth of amyloid fibrils is followed by branching scenarios. Based on the experimental data on the concentration dependence, the sizes of the folding nuclei of fibrils were calculated. It turned out that the size of the primary nucleus is one \"monomer\" and the size of the secondary nucleus is zero. This means that the nucleus for new aggregates can be a surface of the fibrils themselves. Using electron microscopy, we have demonstrated that fibrils of these peptides are formed by the association of rounded ring structures.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular accumulation of wild-type tau is a hallmark of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the molecular mechanisms underlying tau-induced synapse impairment and memory deficit are poorly understood. Here we found that overexpression of human wild-type full-length tau (termed hTau) induced memory deficits with impairments of synaptic plasticity. Both in vivo and in vitro data demonstrated that hTau accumulation caused remarkable dephosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the nuclear fraction. Simultaneously, the calcium-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) was up-regulated, whereas the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) was suppressed. Further studies revealed that CaN activation could dephosphorylate CREB and CaMKIV, and the effect of CaN on CREB dephosphorylation was independent of CaMKIV inhibition. Finally, inhibition of CaN attenuated the hTau-induced CREB dephosphorylation with improved synapse and memory functions. Together, these data indicate that the hTau accumulation impairs synapse and memory by CaN-mediated suppression of nuclear CaMKIV/CREB signaling. Our findings not only reveal new mechanisms underlying the hTau-induced synaptic toxicity, but also provide potential targets for rescuing tauopathies.",

    "abstract": "Glucose hypometabolism in the pre-clinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been primarily associated with the APOE e4 genotype, rather than fibrillar beta-amyloid. In contrast, aberrant patterns of metabolic connectivity are more strongly related to beta-amyloid burden than APOE e4 status. A major limitation of previous studies has been the dichotomous classification of subjects as amyloid-positive or amyloid-negative. Dichotomous treatment of a continuous variable, such as beta-amyloid, potentially obscures the true relationship with metabolism and reduces the power to detect significant changes in connectivity. In the present work, we assessed alterations of glucose metabolism and metabolic connectivity as continuous function of beta-amyloid burden using positron emission tomography scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. Modeling beta-amyloid as a continuous variable resulted in better model fits and improved power compared to the dichotomous model. Using this continuous model, we found that both APOE e4 genotype and beta-amyloid burden are strongly associated with glucose hypometabolism at early stages of Alzheimer's disease. We also determined that the cumulative effects of beta-amyloid deposition result in a particular pattern of altered metabolic connectivity, which is characterized by global, synchronized hypometabolism at early stages of the disease process, followed by regionally heterogeneous, progressive hypometabolism.",

Because (64)Cu (t1/2=12.7h) is a radionuclide for PET with a longer physical half-life than (11)C (t1/2=20min) and (18)F (t1/2=110min), it is an attractive radionuclide for the development of Abeta imaging probes that are suitable for routine use. In the present study, we designed and synthesized two novel (64)Cu labeled benzofuran derivatives and evaluated their utility as PET imaging probes for Abeta aggregates. In an in vitro binding assay, 6 and 8 showed binding affinity for Abeta(1-42) aggregates with a Ki value of 33 and 243nM, respectively. In addition, these probes bound to Abeta plaques deposited in the brain of an AD model mouse in vitro. In a biodistribution experiment using normal mice, these probes showed low brain uptake (0.33% and 0.36% ID/g) at 2min post-injection. Although refinement to enhance brain uptake is needed, [(64)Cu]6 and [(64)Cu]8 demonstrated the feasibility of developing novel PET probes for imaging Abeta aggregates.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia caused by the formation of Abeta aggregates. So far, no effective medicine for the treatment of AD is available. Many efforts have been made to find effective medicine to cope with AD. Curcumin is a drug candidate for AD, being a potent anti-amyloidogenic compound, but the results of clinical trials for it were either negative or inclusive. In the present study, we took advantages from accumulated knowledge about curcumin and have screened out four compounds that have chemical and structural similarity with curcumin more than 80% from all FDA-approved oral drugs. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulation and the free energy perturbation method we showed that among predicted compounds anti-arrhythmic medication propafenone shows the best anti-amyloidogenic activity. The in vitro experiment further revealed that it can inhibit Abeta aggregation and protect cells against Abeta induced cytotoxicity to almost the same extent as curcumin. Our results suggest that propafenone may be a potent drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

To analyze the seeding activity of the pellet fraction, we have either separated or directly immunoisolated membranes from such homogenates. Here, we found considerable Abeta seeding activity associated with membranes in the absence of detectable amyloid fibrils. We also found that Abeta seeds on mitochondrial or associated membranes efficiently induced Abeta aggregation in vitro and seed beta-amyloidosis in vivo.

We evaluated whether steamed and fermented C. lanceolata (SFC) extract improves amyloid-beta- (Abeta-) induced learning and memory impairment in mice. The Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests were used to evaluate the effect of SFC extract. Moreover, we investigated acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling in the hippocampus of mice to determine a possible mechanism for the cognitive-enhancing effect. Saponin compounds in SFC were identified by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). SFC extract ameliorated amyloid-beta-induced memory impairment in the Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests. SFC extract inhibited AChE activity and also significantly increased the level of CREB phosphorylation, BDNF expression, and ERK activation in hippocampal tissue of amyloid-beta-treated mice. Lancemasides A, B, C, D, E, and G and foetidissimoside A compounds present in SFC were determined by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. These results indicate that SFC extract improves Abeta-induced memory deficits and that AChE inhibition and CREB/BDNF/ERK expression is important for the effect of the SFC extract. In addition, lancemaside A specifically may be responsible for efficacious effect of SFC.",

    "abstract": "It has long been known that spirochetes form clumps or micro colonies in vitro and in vivo. Cortical spirochetal colonies in syphilitic dementia were considered as reproductive centers for spirochetes. Historic and recent data demonstrate that senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are made up by spirochetes. Spirochetes, are able to form biofilm in vitro. Senile plaques are also reported to contain elements of biofilm constituents. We expected that AbetaPP and Abeta (the main components of senile plaques) also occur in pure spirochetal biofilms, and bacterial DNA (an important component of biofilm) is also present in senile plaques. Histochemical, immunohistochemical, and in situ hybridization techniques and the TUNEL assay were used to answer these questions. The results obtained demonstrate that Abeta and DNA, including spirochete-specific DNA, are key components of both pure spirochetal biofilms and senile plaques in AD and confirm the biofilm nature of senile plaques. These results validate validate previous observations that AbetaPP and/or an AbetaPP-like amyloidogenic protein are an integral part of spirochetes, and indicate that bacterial and host derived Abeta are both constituents of senile plaques. DNA fragmentation in senile plaques further confirms their bacterial nature and provides biochemical evidence for spirochetal cell death. Spirochetes evade host defenses, locate intracellularly, form more resistant atypical forms and notably biofilms, which contribute to sustain chronic infection and inflammation and explain the slowly progressive course of dementia in AD. To consider co-infecting microorganisms is equally important, as multi-species biofilms result in a higher resistance to treatments and a more severe dementia.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether beta-amyloid (Abeta) was able to enhance neurocan expression in a Sox9 dependent manner in astrocytes. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Astrocytes were incubated with Abeta at different concentrations, the expression of Sox9 and neurocan was detected by Western blot assay. Meanwhile, the viability and proliferation of astrocytes were assessed by MTT assay. Then, the Sox9 expression was silenced, and the expression of Sox9 and neurocan was examined. RESULTS: After incubation with Abeta, the viability of astrocytes was increased regardless silencing of Sox9 (all P<0.05). The proliferation of astrocytes was also gradually increased with the increase in the time of Abeta incubation (all P<0.05). With the increase in Abeta concentration, the expression of Sox9 and neurocan was also increased (all P<0.05). However, after silencing of Sox9 expression, the neurocan expression was significantly reduced as compared to control group and scra-siRNA group (all P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study shows the viability and proliferation of astrocytes are significantly increased by Abeta in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, Abeta may effectively up-regulate the neurocan expression via regulating Sox9.",

    "abstract": "The common apolipoprotein E alleles (epsilon4, epsilon3, and epsilon2) are important genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, with the epsilon4 allele increasing risk and reducing the age of onset and the epsilon2 allele decreasing risk and markedly delaying the age of onset. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype also predicts the timing and amount of brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide deposition and amyloid burden (epsilon4 >epsilon3 >epsilon2). Using several administration protocols, we now report that direct intracerebral adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated delivery of APOE2 markedly reduces brain soluble (including oligomeric) and insoluble Abeta levels as well as amyloid burden in 2 mouse models of brain amyloidosis whose pathology is dependent on either the expression of murine Apoe or more importantly on human APOE4. The efficacy of APOE2 to reduce brain Abeta burden in either model, however, was highly dependent on brain APOE2 levels and the amount of pre-existing Abeta and amyloid deposition. We further demonstrate that a widespread reduction of brain Abeta burden can be achieved through a single injection of vector via intrathalamic delivery of AAV expressing APOE2 gene. Our results demonstrate that AAV gene delivery of APOE2 using an AAV vector rescues the detrimental effects of APOE4 on brain amyloid pathology and may represent a viable therapeutic approach for treating or preventing Alzheimer's disease especially if sufficient brain APOE2 levels can be achieved early in the course of the disease.",

    "abstract": "The misfolding and accumulation of the protein fragment beta-amyloid (Abeta) is an early and essential event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite close biological similarities among primates, humans appear to be uniquely susceptible to the profound neurodegeneration and dementia that characterize AD, even though nonhuman primates deposit copious Abeta in senile plaques and cerebral amyloid-beta angiopathy as they grow old. Because the amino acid sequence of Abeta is identical in all primates studied to date, we asked whether differences in the properties of aggregated Abeta might underlie the vulnerability of humans and the resistance of other primates to AD. In a comparison of aged squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) and humans with AD, immunochemical and mass spectrometric analyses indicate that the populations of Abeta fragments are largely similar in the 2 species. In addition, Abeta-rich brain extracts from the brains of aged squirrel monkeys and AD patients similarly seed the deposition of Abeta in a transgenic mouse model. However, the epitope exposure of aggregated Abeta differs in sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable oligomeric Abeta from the 2 species. In addition, the high-affinity binding of (3)H Pittsburgh Compound B to Abeta is significantly diminished in tissue extracts from squirrel monkeys compared with AD patients. These findings support the hypothesis that differences in the pathobiology of aggregated Abeta among primates are linked to post-translational attributes of the misfolded protein, such as molecular conformation and/or the involvement of species-specific cofactors.",

    "abstract": "We determined the rheological properties of beta-amyloid Langmuir films at the air/water interface, a peptide whose interfacial structure is extended beta-sheet, and compared them with those of films composed of Melittin (Mel), which adopts an alpha-helical conformation at neutral pH. To determine the dilatational and shear moduli we evaluated the response of pure peptide monolayers to an oscillatory anisotropic compressive work. Additionally, a micro-rheological characterization was performed by tracking the diffusion of micrometer sized latex beads onto the interface. This technique allowed us the detection of different rheological behaviour between monolayers presenting a low shear response. Monolayers of the beta-sheet structure-adopting peptides, such as beta-amyloid peptides, exhibited a marked shear (elastic) modulus even at low surface pressures. In contrast, Mel monolayers exhibited negligible shear modulus and the micro-rheological shear response was markedly lower than that observed for either Abeta1-40 or Abeta1-42 amyloid peptides. When Mel monolayers were formed at the interface of an aqueous solution at pH 11, we observed an increase in both the lateral stability and film viscosity as detected by a slower diffusion of the latex beads, in keeping with an increase in beta-sheet structure at this high pH (verified by ATR and FT-IR measurements). We suggest that the interactions responsible for the marked response upon shear observed for beta-amyloid peptide monolayers are the hydrogen bonds of the beta-sheet structure that can form an infinite planar network at the interface. Conversely, alpha-helical Mel peptide lack of these inter-molecular interactions and, therefore the shear contribution was negligible. We propose that the secondary structure is important for modulating the rheological behavior of short peptide monolayers regardless of the mass density or surface charge at the surface.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of sleep/wake activity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients significantly affects their quality of life and that of their caretakers and is a major contributing factor for institutionalization. Levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta) have been shown to be regulated by neuronal activity and to correlate with the sleep/wake cycle. Whether consolidated sleep can be disrupted by Abeta alone is not well understood. We hypothesize that Abeta42 can increase wakefulness and disrupt consolidated sleep. Here we report that flies expressing the human Abeta42 transgene in neurons have significantly reduced consolidated sleep compared with control flies. Fatty acid binding proteins (Fabp) are small hydrophobic ligand carriers that have been clinically implicated in AD. Abeta42 flies that carry a transgene of either the Drosophila Fabp or the mammalian brain-type Fabp show a significant increase in nighttime sleep and long consolidated sleep bouts, rescuing the Abeta42-induced sleep disruption. These studies suggest that alterations in Fabp levels and/or activity may be associated with sleep disturbances in AD. Future work to determine the molecular mechanisms that contribute to Fabp-mediated rescue of Abeta42-induced sleep loss will be important for the development of therapeutics in the treatment of AD.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "The misfolding and self-assembly of amyloid-beta (Abeta) into oligomers and fibres is fundamental to Alzheimer's disease pathology. Alzheimer's disease is a multifaceted disease. One factor that is thought to have a significant role in disease aetiology is Zn(2+) homeostasis, which is disrupted in the brains of Alzheimer's disease sufferers and has been shown to modulate Alzheimer's symptoms in animal models. Here, we investigate how the kinetics of Abeta fibre growth are affected at a range of Zn(2+) concentrations and we use transmission electron microscopy to characterise the aggregate assemblies formed. We demonstrate that for Abeta(1-40), and Abeta(1-42), as little as 0.01mol equivalent of Zn(2+) (100nM) is sufficient to greatly perturb the formation of amyloid fibres irreversibly. Instead, Abeta(1-40) assembles into short, rod-like structures that pack tightly together into ordered stacks, whereas Abeta(1-42) forms short, crooked assemblies that knit together to form a mesh of disordered tangles. Our data suggest that a small number of Zn(2+) ions are able to influence a great many Abeta molecules through the rapid exchange of Zn(2+) between Abeta peptides. Surprisingly, although Cu(2+) binds to Abeta 10,000 times tighter than Zn(2+), the effect of Zn(2+) on Abeta assembly dominates in Cu(2+)/Zn(2+) mixtures, suggesting that trace levels of Zn(2+) must have a profound effect on extracellular Abeta accumulation. Trace Zn(2+) levels profoundly influence Abeta assembly even at concentrations weaker than its affinity for Abeta. These observations indicate that inhibitors of fibre assembly do not necessarily have to be at high concentration and affinity to have a profound impact.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the in vivo cortical spreading pattern of tau and amyloid and to establish positron emission tomography (PET) image-based tau staging in the Alzheimer disease (AD) spectrum. METHODS: We included 195 participants (53 AD, 52 amnestic mild cognitive impairment [MCI], 23 nonamnestic MCI, and 67 healthy controls) who underwent 2 PET scans ((18) F-florbetaben for amyloid-beta and (18) F-AV-1451 for tau). We assumed that regions with earlier appearances of pathology may show increased binding in a greater number of participants and acquired spreading order of tau accumulation by sorting the regional frequencies of involvement. We classified each participant into image-based tau stage based on the Z score of the composite region for each stage. RESULTS: Tau accumulation was most frequently observed in the medial temporal regions and spread stepwise to the basal and lateral temporal, inferior parietal, posterior cingulate, and other association cortices, and then ultimately to the primary cortical regions. In contrast, amyloid accumulation was found with similar frequency in the diffuse neocortical areas and then finally spread to the medial temporal regions. The image-based tau stage correlated with the general cognitive status, whereas cortical thinning was found only in the advanced tau stages: medial temporal region in stage V and widespread cortex in stage VI. INTERPRETATION: Our PET study replicated postmortem spreading patterns of tau and amyloid-beta pathologies. Unlike the diffuse accumulation of amyloid throughout the neocortex, tau spreading occurred in a stepwise fashion through the networks. Image-based tau staging may be useful for the objective assessment of AD progression. Ann Neurol 2016;80:247-258.",

    "title": "Biomarker clusters are differentially associated with longitudinal cognitive decline in late midlife.",
    "abstract": "The ability to detect preclinical Alzheimer's disease is of great importance, as this stage of the Alzheimer's continuum is believed to provide a key window for intervention and prevention. As Alzheimer's disease is characterized by multiple pathological changes, a biomarker panel reflecting co-occurring pathology will likely be most useful for early detection. Towards this end, 175 late middle-aged participants (mean age 55.9 +- 5.7 years at first cognitive assessment, 70% female) were recruited from two longitudinally followed cohorts to undergo magnetic resonance imaging and lumbar puncture. Cluster analysis was used to group individuals based on biomarkers of amyloid pathology (cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta42/amyloid-beta40 assay levels), magnetic resonance imaging-derived measures of neurodegeneration/atrophy (cerebrospinal fluid-to-brain volume ratio, and hippocampal volume), neurofibrillary tangles (cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau181 assay levels), and a brain-based marker of vascular risk (total white matter hyperintensity lesion volume). Four biomarker clusters emerged consistent with preclinical features of (i) Alzheimer's disease; (ii) mixed Alzheimer's disease and vascular aetiology; (iii) suspected non-Alzheimer's disease aetiology; and (iv) healthy ageing. Cognitive decline was then analysed between clusters using longitudinal assessments of episodic memory, semantic memory, executive function, and global cognitive function with linear mixed effects modelling. Cluster 1 exhibited a higher intercept and greater rates of decline on tests of episodic memory. Cluster 2 had a lower intercept on a test of semantic memory and both Cluster 2 and Cluster 3 had steeper rates of decline on a test of global cognition. Additional analyses on Cluster 3, which had the smallest hippocampal volume, suggest that its biomarker profile is more likely due to hippocampal vulnerability and not to detectable specific volume loss exceeding the rate of normal ageing. Our results demonstrate that pathology, as indicated by biomarkers, in a preclinical timeframe is related to patterns of longitudinal cognitive decline. Such biomarker patterns may be useful for identifying at-risk populations to recruit for clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disease and it is caused by neuronal death in the brain. Recent studies have shown that non-ionizing radiofrequency (RF) radiation has some beneficial cognitive effects in animal models of AD. In this study, we examined the effect of combined RF radiation on amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced cytotoxicity in HT22 rat hippocampal neurons. Treatment with Abeta suppressed HT22 cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. RF exposure did not affect cell proliferation, and also had a marginal effect on Abeta-induced suppression of growth in HT22 cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that Abeta decreased the G1 fraction and increased the subG1 fraction, indicating increased apoptosis. Accordingly, Abeta increased the annexin V/propidium iodide (PI)-positive cell fraction and the degradation of poly (ADP ribose) polymerase and caspase-3 in HT22 cells. However, RF alone and the combination of Abeta and RF did not affect these events significantly. Abeta increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, thereby suppressing cell proliferation. This was abrogated by N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment, indicating that Abeta-induced ROS generation is the main cause of suppression of proliferation. NAC also restored Abeta-induced annexin V/PI-positive cell populations. However, RF did not have a significant impact on these events. Finally, Abeta stimulated the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein/checkpoint kinase 1 DNA single-strand breakage pathway, and enhanced beta-site amyloid precursor protein expression; RF had no effect on them. Taken together, our results demonstrate that RF exposure did not significantly affect the Abeta-induced decrease of cell proliferation, increase of ROS production, or induction of cell death in these cells.",

    "abstract": "The dysfunction and loss of synapses in Alzheimer disease are central to dementia symptoms. We have recently demonstrated that pathological Amyloid beta oligomer (Abetao) regulates the association between intracellular protein mediators and the synaptic receptor complex composed of cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). Here we sought to determine whether Abetao alters the physiological signaling of the PrP(C)-mGluR5 complex upon glutamate activation. We provide evidence that acute exposure to Abetao as well as chronic expression of familial Alzheimer disease mutant transgenes in model mice prevents protein-protein interaction changes of the complex induced by the glutamate analog 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine. We further show that 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine triggers the phosphorylation and activation of protein-tyrosine kinase 2-beta (PTK2B, also referred to as Pyk2) and of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in wild-type brain slices but not in Alzheimer disease transgenic brain slices or wild-type slices incubated with Abetao. This study further distinguishes two separate Abetao-dependent signaling cascades, one dependent on extracellular Ca(2+) and Fyn kinase activation and the other dependent on the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. Thus, Abetao triggers multiple distinct PrP(C)-mGluR5-dependent events implicated in neurodegeneration and dementia. We propose that targeting the PrP(C)-mGluR5 complex will reverse aberrant Abetao-triggered states of the complex to allow physiological fluctuations of glutamate signaling.",

    "abstract": "Many protein folding diseases are intimately associated with accumulation of amyloid aggregates. The amyloid materials formed by different proteins/peptides share many structural similarities, despite sometimes large amino acid sequence differences. Some amyloid diseases constitute risk factors for others, and the progression of one amyloid disease may affect the progression of another. These connections are arguably related to amyloid aggregates of one protein being able to directly nucleate amyloid formation of another, different protein: the amyloid cross-interaction. Here, we discuss such cross-interactions between the Alzheimer disease amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and other amyloid proteins in the context of what is known from in vitro and in vivo experiments, and of what might be learned from clinical studies. The aim is to clarify potential molecular associations between different amyloid diseases.

    "abstract": "Angelman Syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder associated with significant developmental and communication delays, high risk for epilepsy, motor dysfunction, and a characteristic behavioral profile. While Angelman Syndrome is known to be associated with the loss of maternal expression of the ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A gene, the molecular sequelae of this loss remain to be fully understood. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is involved in neuronal development and APP dysregulation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of other developmental disorders including fragile X syndrome and idiopathic autism. APP dysregulation has been noted in preclinical model of chromosome 15q13 duplication, a disorder whose genetic abnormality results in duplication of the region that is epigenetically silenced in Angelman Syndrome. In this duplication model, APP levels have been shown to be significantly reduced leading to the hypothesis that enhanced ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A expression may be associated with this phenomena. We tested the hypothesis that ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A regulates APP protein levels by comparing peripheral APP and APP derivative levels in humans with Angelman Syndrome to those with neurotypical development. We report that APP total, APP alpha (sAPPalpha) and A Beta 40 and 42 are elevated in the plasma of humans with Angelman Syndrome compared to neurotypical matched human samples. Additionally, we found that elevations in APP total and sAPPalpha correlated positively with peripheral brain derived neurotrophic factor levels previously reported in this same patient cohort. Our pilot report on APP protein levels in Angelman Syndrome warrants additional exploration and may provide a molecular target of treatment for the disorder.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Here spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-beta deposition, metabolism, vascular, functional activity at rest, structural properties, cognitive integrity and peripheral proteins levels are characterized in relation to LOAD progression. We analyse over 7,700 brain images and tens of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Through a multifactorial data-driven analysis, we obtain dynamic LOAD-abnormality indices for all biomarkers, and a tentative temporal ordering of disease progression. Imaging results suggest that intra-brain vascular dysregulation is an early pathological event during disease development. Cognitive decline is noticeable from initial LOAD stages, suggesting early memory deficit associated with the primary disease factors. High abnormality levels are also observed for specific proteins associated with the vascular system's integrity. Although still subjected to the sensitivity of the algorithms and biomarkers employed, our results might contribute to the development of preventive therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Recent Alzheimer's trials have recruited cognitively normal people at risk for Alzheimer's dementia. Due to the lack of clinical symptoms in normal population, conventional clinical outcome measures are not suitable for these early trials. While several groups are developing new composite cognitive tests that could serve as potential outcome measures by detecting subtle cognitive changes in normal people, there is a need for longitudinal brain imaging techniques that can correlate with temporal changes in these new tests and provide additional objective measures of neuropathological changes in brain. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine imaging procedure based on the measurement of annihilation photons after positron emission from radiolabeled molecules that allow tracking of biological processes in body, including the brain. PET is a well-established in vivo imaging modality in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and research due to its capability of detecting abnormalities in three major hallmarks of this disease. These include (1) amyloid beta plaques; (2) neurofibrillary tau tangles and (3) decrease in neuronal activity due to loss of nerve cell connection and death. While semiquantitative PET imaging techniques are commonly used to set discrete cut-points to stratify abnormal levels of amyloid accumulation and neurodegeneration, they are suboptimal for detecting subtle longitudinal changes. In this study, we have identified and discussed four critical barriers in conventional longitudinal PET imaging that may be particularly relevant for early Alzheimer's disease studies. These include within and across subject heterogeneity of AD-affected brain regions, PET intensity normalization, neuronal compensations in early disease stages and cerebrovascular amyloid deposition.",

Although the accumulation and deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain is viewed as one of the pathological hallmarks of AD and underlies, at least in part, brain cell dysfunction and behavior alterations, the etiology of this neurodegenerative disease is still poorly understood. Noticeably, increased amyloid load is accompanied by marked inflammatory alterations, both at the level of the brain parenchyma and at the barriers of the brain. However, it is debatable whether the neuroinflammation observed in aging and in AD, together with alterations in the peripheral immune system, are responsible for increased amyloidogenesis, decreased clearance of Abeta out of the brain and/or the marked deficits in memory and cognition manifested by AD patients. Herein, we scrutinize some important traits of the pathophysiology of aging and AD, focusing on the interplay between the amyloidogenic pathway, neuroinflammation and the peripheral immune system.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) serve as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Genetic variation in miRNAs and miRNA-binding sites may affect miRNA function and contribute to disease risk. Here, we investigated the extent to which variants within miRNA-related sequences could constitute a part of the functional variants involved in developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), using the largest available genome-wide association study of AD. First, among 237 variants in miRNAs, we found rs2291418 in the miR-1229 precursor to be significantly associated with AD (p-value = 6.8 x 10(-5), OR = 1.2). Our in-silico analysis and in-vitro miRNA expression experiments demonstrated that the variant's mutant allele enhances the production of miR-1229-3p. Next, we found miR-1229-3p target genes that are associated with AD and might mediate the miRNA function. We demonstrated that miR-1229-3p directly controls the expression of its top AD-associated target gene (SORL1) using luciferase reporter assays. Additionally, we showed that miR-1229-3p and SORL1 are both expressed in the human brain. Second, among 42,855 variants in miRNA-binding sites, we identified 10 variants (in the 3' UTR of 9 genes) that are significantly associated with AD, including rs6857 that increases the miR-320e-mediated regulation of PVRL2. Collectively, this study shows that miRNA-related variants are associated with AD and suggests miRNA-dependent regulation of several AD genes.",

    "abstract": "The choroid plexus (CP) epithelium is a unique structure in the brain that forms an interface between the peripheral blood on the basal side and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on the apical side. It is a relevant source of many polypeptides secreted to the CSF with neuroprotective functions and also participates in the elimination and detoxification of brain metabolites, such as beta-amyloid (Abeta) removal from the CSF through transporter-mediated influx. The CP is also a target tissue for sex hormones (SHs) that have recognised neuroprotective effects against a variety of insults, including Abeta toxicity and oxidative stress in the central nervous system. The present study aimed to understand how SHs modulate Abeta-induced oxidative stress in a CP cell line (Z310 cell line) by analysing the effects of Abeta1-42 on oxidative stress, mitochondrial function and apoptosis, as well as by assessing how 17beta-oestradiol (E2 ) and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) modulated these effects and the cellular uptake of Abeta1-42 by CP cells. Our findings show that E2 and DHT treatment reduce Abeta1-42 -induced oxidative stress and the internalisation of Abeta1-42 by CP epithelial cells, highlighting the importance of considering the background of SHs and therefore sex-related differences in Abeta metabolism and clearance by CP cells.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be involved in many neurodegenerative diseases. The present study focused on the role of hsa-miR-144-3p in one of the neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease (PD). Our study showed a remarkable down-regulation of miR-144-3p expression in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated SH-SY5Y cells. MiR-144-3p was then overexpressed and silenced in human SH-SY5Y cells by miRNA-mimics and miRNA-inhibitor transfections, respectively. Furthermore, beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) was identified as a target gene of miR-144-3p via a luciferase reporter assay. We found that miR-144-3p overexpression significantly inhibited the protein expression of APP. Since mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be one of the major pathological events in PD, we also focused on the role of miR-144-3p and APP in regulating mitochondrial functions. Our study demonstrated that up-regulation of miR-144-3p increased expression of the key genes involved in maintaining mitochondrial function, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Moreover, there was also a significant increase in cellular ATP, cell viability and the relative copy number of mtDNA in the presence of miR-144-3p overexpression. In contrast, miR-144-3p silencing showed opposite effects. We also found that APP overexpression significantly decreased ATP level, cell viability, the relative copy number of mtDNA and the expression of these three genes, which reversed the effects of miR-144-3p overexpression. Taken together, these results show that miR-144-3p plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial function, and its target gene APP is also involved in this process.",

However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for precisely how amyloid-beta and cerebral small vessel disease affect cognitive impairment remain unclear. We investigated the effects of amyloid-beta and lacunes on downstream imaging markers including structural network and cortical thickness, further analysing their relative impact on cognitive trajectories. We prospectively recruited a pool of 117 mild cognitive impairment patients (45 amnestic type and 72 subcortical vascular type), from which 83 patients received annual follow-up with neuropsychological tests and brain magnetic resonance imaging for 3 years, and 87 patients received a second Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography analysis. Structural networks based on diffusion tensor imaging and cortical thickness were analysed. We used linear mixed effect regression models to evaluate the effects of imaging markers on cognitive decline. Time-varying Pittsburgh compound B uptake was associated with temporoparietal thinning, which correlated with memory decline (verbal memory test, unstandardized beta = -0.79, P < 0.001; visual memory test, unstandardized beta = -2.84, P = 0.009). Time-varying lacune number was associated with the degree of frontoparietal network disruption or thinning, which further affected frontal-executive function decline (Digit span backward test, unstandardized beta = -0.05, P = 0.002; Stroop colour test, unstandardized beta = -0.94, P = 0.008). Of the multiple imaging markers analysed, Pittsburgh compound B uptake and the number of lacunes had the greatest association with memory decline and frontal-executive function decline, respectively: Time-varying Pittsburgh compound B uptake (standardized beta = -0.25, P = 0.010) showed the strongest effect on visual memory test, followed by time-varying temporoparietal thickness (standardized beta = 0.21, P = 0.010) and time-varying nodal efficiency (standardized beta = 0.17, P = 0.024). Time-varying lacune number (standardized beta = -0.25, P = 0.014) showed the strongest effect on time-varying digit span backward test followed by time-varying nodal efficiency (standardized beta = 0.17, P = 0.021). Finally, time-varying lacune number (beta = -0.22, P = 0.034) showed the strongest effect on time-varying Stroop colour test followed by time-varying frontal thickness (standardized beta = 0.19, P = 0.026). Our multimodal imaging analyses suggest that cognitive trajectories related to amyloid-beta and lacunes have distinct paths, and that amyloid-beta or lacunes have greatest impact on cognitive decline. Our results provide rationale for the targeting of amyloid-beta and lacunes in therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating cognitive decline.",

Recently, it was reported that administration of intravenous immunoglobulin at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) reduces brain atrophy. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between naturally occurring anti-Abeta autoantibodies and brain atrophy in patients with cognitive impairment. METHODS: Serum and CSF levels of anti-Abeta autoantibodies and CSF biomarkers were evaluated in 68 patients with cognitive impairment, comprising 44 patients with AD, 19 patients with amnestic MCI and five patients with non-Alzheimer's dementia. The degree of brain atrophy was assessed using the voxel-based specific regional analysis system for AD, which targets the volume of interest (VOI) in medial temporal structures, including the whole hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and amygdala. RESULTS: CSF levels of anti-Abeta autoantibodies were inversely correlated with the extent and severity of VOI atrophy, and the ratio of VOI/grey matter atrophy in patients with AD, but not in MCI or non-AD patients. Serum levels of anti-Abeta autoantibodies were not associated with these parameters in any of the patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that CSF levels of naturally occurring anti-Abeta autoantibodies are inversely associated with the degree of the VOI atrophy in patients with AD. Although the mechanism is unclear, CSF levels of naturally occurring anti-Abeta autoantibodies may be implicated in the progression of atrophy of the whole hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and amygdala, in AD.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) and its aggregates in the ageing central nervous system is regarded synonymous to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Despite unquestionable advances in mechanistic and diagnostic aspects of the disease understanding, the primary cause of Abeta accumulation as well as its in vivo roles remains elusive; nonetheless, the majority of the efforts to address pathological mechanisms for therapeutic development are focused towards moderating Abeta accumulation in the brain. More recently, Abeta deposition has been identified in the eye and is linked with distinct age-related diseases including age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma as well as AD. Awareness of the Abeta accumulation in these markedly different degenerative disorders has led to an increasing body of work exploring overlapping mechanisms, a prospective biomarker role for Abeta and the potential to use retina as a model for brain related neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we present an integrated view of current understanding of the retinal Abeta deposition discussing the accumulation mechanisms, anticipated impacts and outlining ameliorative approaches that can be extrapolated to the retina for potential therapeutic benefits. Further longitudinal investigations in humans and animal models will determine retinal Abeta association as a potential pathognomonic, diagnostic or prognostic biomarker.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques are pathological hallmarks of neurodegenerative Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is predominantly characterized by clinical symptoms of dementia. Therapies targeting Abeta are essential for preventing and treating AD. This review focuses on the non-amyloidogenic pathways that prevent the generation of Abeta peptide and thereby plaque formation in AD. An a-secretase-dependent cleavage of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) precludes the amyloidogenic pathway of Abeta generation. This non-amyloidogenic a-secretase activation thereby secretes sAPPa with prominent neurotrophic and memory-enhancing properties. Several \"A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease\" (ADAM) proteins, specifically ADAM17, ADAM10 and ADAM9, comprise active members of this a-secretase family. It is conventionally accepted that whereas ADAM10 executes constitutive APP cleavage, ADAM17 and ADAM9 are dedicated towards the regulated processing. Therefore, promoting a-secretase activity offers thorough neuroprotection against AD, and emerges as a pertinent strategy in attenuating Abeta. We discuss signaling pathways, particularly those mediated by protein kinase C and phorbol esters, that enhance ADAM functioning and sAPPa release. We also elaborate upon the associated M1 and M3-muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, ERK-MAP kinase, tyrosine kinase and calcium signaling pathways. Clinical studies suggest that regulated hormone and cholesterol levels are essential for restricting neurodegeneration, and here we illustrate the role of estrogen and testosterone and that of cholesterol-attenuating statins in generating sAPPa. We also emphasize the need for novel ADAM activators that may be screened for targeting the interleukin-1-responsive mRNA 5'-untranslated region of APP. This review offers an in-depth insight into pathways, strategies and probable therapies restricting AD pathology via its non-amyloidogenic route.",

We have identified that stress can exacerbate the severity of post-stroke secondary neurodegeneration in the thalamus. In this study, we investigated whether exposure to stress could influence the accumulation of the neurotoxic protein Amyloid-beta. Using an experimental model of focal cortical ischemia in adult mice combined with exposure to chronic restraint stress, we examined changes within the contra- and ipsilateral thalamus at six weeks post-stroke using Western blotting and immunohistochemical approaches. Western blotting analysis indicated that stroke was associated with a significant enhancement of the 25 and 50 kDa oligomers within the ipsilateral hemisphere and the 20 kDa oligomer within the contralateral hemisphere. Stroked animals exposed to stress exhibited an additional increase in multiple forms of Amyloid-beta oligomers. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed that stroke was associated with a significant accumulation of Amyloid-beta within the thalami of both hemispheres, an effect that was exacerbated in stroke animals exposed to stress. Given that Amyloid-beta oligomers, most notably the 30-40 and 50 kDa oligomers, are recognised to correlate with accelerated cognitive decline, our results suggest that monitoring stress levels in patients recovering from stroke may merit consideration in the future.",

    "abstract": "MDMA is one of the most used drugs by adolescents and its consumption has been associated with many psychobiological problems, among them psychomotor problems. Moreover, some authors described that early exposure to MDMA may render the dopaminergic neurons more vulnerable to the effects of future neurotoxic insults. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia in the elderly and a percentage of the patients have predisposition to suffer nigrostriatal alterations, developing extrapyramidal signs. Nigrostriatal dysfunction in the brain of aged APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1), a mouse model of familiar AD (FAD), has also been described. The aim of the present study was to investigate the consequences of adolescent exposure to MDMA in APP/PS1 mice, on nigrostriatal function on early adulthood. We used a MDMA schedule simulating weekend binge abuse of this substance. Our MDMA schedule produced a genotype-independent decrease in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra that remained at least 3months. Shortly after the injury, wild-type animals showed a decrease in the locomotor activity and apparent DA depletion in striatum, however in the APP/PS1 mice neither the locomotor activity nor the DA levels were modified, but a reduction in dopamine transporter (DAT) expression and a higher levels of oxidative stress were observed. We found that these disturbances are age-related characteristics that this APP/PS1 mice develops spontaneously much later. Therefore, MDMA administration seems to anticipate the striatal dopaminergic dysfunction in this FAD model. The most important outcome lies in a potentiation, by MDMA, of the amyloid beta deposition in the striatum.",

    "abstract": "Multiple isoforms of aggregation-prone proteins are present under physiological conditions and have the propensity to assemble into co-oligomers with different properties from self-oligomers, but this process has not been quantitatively studied to date. We have investigated the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, associated with Alzheimer's disease, and the aggregation of its two major isoforms, Abeta40 and Abeta42, using a statistical mechanical modelling approach in combination with in vitro single-molecule fluorescence measurements. We find that at low concentrations of Abeta, corresponding to its physiological abundance, there is little free energy penalty in forming co-oligomers, suggesting that the formation of both self-oligomers and co-oligomers is possible under these conditions. Our model is used to predict the oligomer concentration and size at physiological concentrations of Abeta and suggests the mechanisms by which the ratio of Abeta42 to Abeta40 can affect cell toxicity. An increased ratio of Abeta42 to Abeta40 raises the fraction of oligomers containing Abeta42, which can increase the hydrophobicity of the oligomers and thus promote deleterious binding to the cell membrane and increase neuronal damage. Our results suggest that co-oligomers are a common form of aggregate when Abeta isoforms are present in solution and may potentially play a significant role in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Solution NMR structure and inhibitory effect against amyloid-beta fibrillation of Humanin containing a d-isomerized serine residue.",
    "abstract": "Humanin comprising 24 amino acid residues is a bioactive peptide that has been isolated from the brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Humanin reportedly suppressed aging-related death of various cells due to amyloid fibrils and oxidative stress. There are reports that the cytoprotective activity of Humanin was remarkably enhanced by optical isomerization of the Ser14 residue from l to d form, but details of the molecular mechanism remained unclear. Here we demonstrated that Humanin d-Ser14 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against fibrillation of amyloid-beta and remarkably higher binding affinity for amyloid-beta than that of the Humanin wild-type and S14G mutant. In addition, we determined the solution structure of Humanin d-Ser14 by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and showed that d-isomerization of the Ser14 residue enables drastic conformational rearrangement of Humanin. Furthermore, we identified an amyloid-beta-binding site on Humanin d-Ser14 at atomic resolution by NMR. These biophysical and high-resolution structural analyses clearly revealed structure-function relationships of Humanin and explained the driving force of the drastic conformational change and molecular basis of the potent anti-amyloid-beta fibrillation activity of Humanin caused by d-isomerization of the Ser14 residue. This is the first study to show correlations between the functional activity, tertiary structure, and partner recognition mode of Humanin and may lead to elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of the cytoprotective activity of Humanin.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The fruiting body of Hericium erinaceus has been demonstrated to possess anti-dementia activity in mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and people with mild cognitive impairment. However, the therapeutic potential of Hericium erinaceus mycelia on Alzheimer's disease remains unclear. In this study, the effects of erinacine A-enriched Hericium erinaceus mycelia (HE-My) on the pathological changes in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease are studied. RESULTS: After a 30 day oral administration to 5 month-old female APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice, we found that HE-My and its ethanol extracts (HE-Et) attenuated cerebral Abeta plaque burden. It's worth noting that the attenuated portion of a plaque is the non-compact structure. The level of insulin-degrading enzyme was elevated by both HE-My and HE-Et in cerebral cortex. On the other hand, the number of plaque-activated microglia and astrocytes in cerebral cortex and hippocampus were diminished, the ratio of nerve growth factor (NGF) to NGF precursor (proNGF) was increased and hippocampal neurogenesis was promoted after these administrations. All the mentioned benefits of these administrations may therefore improve the declined activity of daily living skill in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the therapeutic potential of HE-My and HE-Et on Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the effective components of HE-My and HE-Et are worth to be developed to become a therapeutic drug for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau is an excellent surrogate marker for assessing neuropathological changes that occur in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, whether the elevated tau in AD CSF is just a marker of neurodegeneration or, in fact, a part of the disease process is uncertain. Moreover, it is unknown how CSF tau relates to the recently described soluble high-molecular-weight (HMW) species that is found in the postmortem AD brain and can be taken up by neurons and seed aggregates. METHODS: We have examined seeding and uptake properties of brain extracellular tau from various sources, including interstitial fluid (ISF) and CSF from an AD transgenic mouse model and postmortem ventricular and antemortem lumbar CSF from AD patients. RESULTS: We found that brain ISF and CSF tau from the AD mouse model can be taken up by cells and induce intracellular aggregates. Ventricular CSF from AD patients contained a rare HMW tau species that exerted a higher seeding activity. Notably, the HMW tau species was also detected in lumbar CSF from AD patients, and its levels were significantly elevated compared to control subjects. HMW tau derived from CSF of AD patients was seed competent in vitro. INTERPRETATION: These findings suggest that CSF from an AD brain contains potentially bioactive HMW tau species, giving new insights into the role of CSF tau and biomarker development for AD.

    "abstract": "beta-Amyloid (Abeta) plaques are the key neurotoxic assemblies in Alzheimer disease. It has been suggested that an interaction occurs between membrane cholesterol and Abeta aggregation in the brain. Cyclodextrins can remove cholesterol from cell membranes and change receptor function. This study aimed to investigate the effect of hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-CD) polymeric microspheres, based on chitosan or sodium alginate, on the levels of lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species production, and mitochondrial function in brain synaptosomes. The effect of microspheres on DNA fragmentation, the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and Apex1 mRNAs in rat hippocampus after Abeta(1-42) peptide-induced neurotoxicity was also evaluated. Comparison with HP-CD raw material was performed. Abeta(1-42) treatment significantly decreased the mitochondrial activity of Apex1 and Bcl-2 mRNAs, induced DNA fragmentation, and increased mRNA levels of Bax. Treatment with HP-CD microspheres against Abeta(1-42) significantly reduced DNA fragmentation and increased the Bcl-2/Bax mRNA ratio and mitochondrial function. In addition, HP-CD microspheres used against Abeta(1-42) decreased the levels of lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species production. These results indicate that nasally administered spray-dried HP-CD microspheres are able to provide protection against Abeta(1-42)-induced neurotoxicity, due to the suppressed levels of oxidative stress and apoptotic signals in the rat hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a 39-42 residue protein produced by the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which subsequently aggregates to form cross-beta amyloid fibrils that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The most prominent forms of Abeta are Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42, which differ by two amino acids (I and A) at the C-terminus. However, Abeta42 is more neurotoxic and essential to the etiology of AD. Here, we present an atomic resolution structure of a monomorphic form of AbetaM01-42 amyloid fibrils derived from over 500 (13)C-(13)C, (13)C-(15)N distance and backbone angle structural constraints obtained from high field magic angle spinning NMR spectra. The structure (PDB ID: 5KK3 ) shows that the fibril core consists of a dimer of Abeta42 molecules, each containing four beta-strands in a S-shaped amyloid fold, and arranged in a manner that generates two hydrophobic cores that are capped at the end of the chain by a salt bridge. The outer surface of the monomers presents hydrophilic side chains to the solvent. The interface between the monomers of the dimer shows clear contacts between M35 of one molecule and L17 and Q15 of the second. Intermolecular (13)C-(15)N constraints demonstrate that the amyloid fibrils are parallel in register. The RMSD of the backbone structure (Q15-A42) is 0.71 +- 0.12 A and of all heavy atoms is 1.07 +- 0.08 A. The structure provides a point of departure for the design of drugs that bind to the fibril surface and therefore interfere with secondary nucleation and for other therapeutic approaches to mitigate Abeta42 aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Bacosides, class of compounds extracted from the Bacopa monniera plant, exhibit interesting therapeutic properties, particularly enhancing cognitive functions and putative anti-amyloid activity. We show that bacoside-A exerted significant effects upon fibrillation and membrane interactions of the amyloidogenic fragment of the prion protein [PrP(106-126)]. Specifically, when co-incubated with PrP(106-126), bacoside-A accelerated fibril formation in the presence of lipid bilayers and in parallel inhibited bilayer interactions of the peptide aggregates formed in solution. These interesting phenomena were studied by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, which suggest that bacoside A-promoted fibrillation reduced the concentration of membrane-active pre-fibrillar species of the prion fragment. This study suggests that induction of fibril formation and corresponding inhibition of membrane interactions are likely the underlying factors for ameliorating amyloid protein toxicity by bacoside-A.",

However, development of diagnostic tools in AD has been hindered by obstacles such as the absence of exact biomarkers. Apoptosis caused by amyloid-beta (Abeta) plays an important role in AD pathology; therefore, provides an attractive biological target for the diagnosis of AD. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of small peptide, named ApoPep-1 (Apoptosis-targeting peptide-1) as a new apoptosis imaging agent in AD. The fluorescein-conjugated ApoPep-1, but not the control peptide, targeted apoptotic cells in the brain of amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) mice. We also observed fluorescence signals during in vivo imaging of apoptotic cells using ApoPep-1, and fluorescence levels increased in an age-dependent manner in APP/PS1 mice. Ex vivo imaging of isolated brains in APP/PS1 mice further confirmed the targeting of ApoPep-1 to apoptotic cells. The fluorescein-labeled ApoPep-1 co-localized with brain cells such as neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, all of which undergo apoptosis in the APP/PS1 mice brain. These findings demonstrate that ApoPep-1 can target apoptotic brain cells, and be used for experimental investigations relevant to apoptosis in AD.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate differences in amyloid deposition in a community-based cohort without dementia by age, sex, race, education, and APOE epsilon4 allele status. METHODS: Recruited from the longitudinal Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, 329 participants without dementia, ages 67-88 years, were imaged using florbetapir PET at 3 US community sites (Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; and Jackson, Mississippi). Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated; global cortical SUVR >1.2 was evaluated as the primary outcome. Age, race, sex, education level, and number of APOE epsilon4 alleles were evaluated in multivariable models including vascular risk factors, brain white matter hyperintensity and total intracranial volume, and cognitive status. RESULTS: A total of 141 of the participants (43%) were black. In multivariable models, odds of elevated SUVR was increased in participants with increasing age (odds ratio [OR] 1.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-2.65 per 10 years of age) and black race (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.23-3.51) but did not differ by educational level. Each epsilon4 allele was associated with increased odds of elevated SUVR (OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.61-4.39). CONCLUSIONS: In this community-based cohort without dementia, florbetapir uptake is associated with older age and APOE genotype. Black race was associated with higher SUVR, after adjusting for demographics, vascular risk factors, cognitive status, white matter hyperintensity volume, and APOE genotype, with effect sizes nearing those seen for APOE epsilon4. Replication of these findings is needed in other cohorts, and reasons for and consequences of these observed differences by race warrant further study.",

    "abstract": "Biomarkers have become an essential component of Alzheimer disease (AD) research and because of the pervasiveness of AD pathology in the elderly, the same biomarkers are used in cognitive aging research. A number of current issues suggest that an unbiased descriptive classification scheme for these biomarkers would be useful. We propose the \"A/T/N\" system in which 7 major AD biomarkers are divided into 3 binary categories based on the nature of the pathophysiology that each measures. \"A\" refers to the value of a beta-amyloid biomarker (amyloid PET or CSF Abeta42); \"T,\" the value of a tau biomarker (CSF phospho tau, or tau PET); and \"N,\" biomarkers of neurodegeneration or neuronal injury ([(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, structural MRI, or CSF total tau). Each biomarker category is rated as positive or negative. An individual score might appear as A+/T+/N-, or A+/T-/N-, etc. The A/T/N system includes the new modality tau PET. It is agnostic to the temporal ordering of mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis. It includes all individuals in any population regardless of the mix of biomarker findings and therefore is suited to population studies of cognitive aging. It does not specify disease labels and thus is not a diagnostic classification system. It is a descriptive system for categorizing multidomain biomarker findings at the individual person level in a format that is easy to understand and use. Given the present lack of consensus among AD specialists on terminology across the clinically normal to dementia spectrum, a biomarker classification scheme will have broadest acceptance if it is independent from any one clinically defined diagnostic scheme.",

    "abstract": "The neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are extracellular plaques built up by the accumulation of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP)-derived peptide beta (Abeta), and intracellular tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) is a member of the sirtuin family, featuring conserved enzymes with deacetylase activity and involved in several cell molecular pathways. We investigated the importance of SIRT2 inhibition in AD. We inhibited SIRT2 by small molecules (AGK-2, AK-7) and examined AbetaPP metabolism in H4-SW neuroglioma cells overexpressing AbetaPP and two AD transgenic mouse models (3xTg-AD and APP23). The in vitro studies suggested that the inhibition of SIRT2 reduced Abeta production; in vivo data showed an improvement of cognitive performance in the novel object recognition test, and an effect on AbetaPP proteolytic processing leading to a reduction of soluble beta-AbetaPP and an increase of soluble alpha-AbetaPP protein. In 3xTg-AD mice, we noticed that total tau protein level rose. Overall, our pre-clinical data support a role for SIRT2 inhibition in the improvement of cognitive performance and the modulation of molecular mechanisms relevant for AD, thus deserving attention as possible therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "The pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation, neurofibrillary tangle formation, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal loss. The present study was performed to investigate the protective effects and mechanism of action of a prosaposin-derived 18-mer peptide (PS18: LSELIINNATEELLIKGL) on mice hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation, neurogenesis, and memory tasks after intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta1-42 peptide. Seven days after Abeta1-42 injection, significant proliferation of hippocampal progenitor cells and memory impairment were evident. Two weeks after Abeta1-42 peptide injection, elevated numbers of surviving 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine cells and newly formed neurons were detected. Treatment with PS18 attenuated these effects evoked by Abeta1-42. Our data indicate that treatment with PS18 partially attenuated the increase in hippocampal neurogenesis caused by Abeta1-42-induced neuroinflammation and prevented memory deficits associated with increased numbers of activated glial cells. We observed an increase in ADAM10 and decreases in BACE1, PS1/2, and AbetaPP protein levels, suggesting that PS18 enhances the nonamyloidogenic AbetaPP cleavage pathway. Importantly, our results further showed that PS18 activated the PI3K/Akt pathway, phosphorylated GSK-3alpha/beta, and, as a consequence, exerted a neuroprotective effect. In addition, PS18 showed a protective effect against Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity via suppression of the caspase pathway; upregulation of Bcl-2; downregulation of BAX, attenuating mitochondrial damage; and inhibition of caspase-3. These findings suggest that PS18 may provide a valuable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an infectious disease caused by spirochetes, and these spirochetes form biofilms, which attract the innate immune system. The innate immune system first responder, Toll-like receptor 2, generates both NF-kappaB and TNF-alpha which try to kill the spirochetes in the biofilm, but cannot penetrate the \"slime\". NF-kappaB is also responsible for the generation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) which itself is anti-microbial. Abeta cannot penetrate the biofilm either, and its accumulation leads to destruction of the cerebral neurocircuitry. Treatment with penicillin (as in tertiary syphilis, the comparator to AD) is outlined; a biofilm dispersing agent may need to be added to the protocol.",

    "abstract": "Several pathological and epidemiological studies have demonstrated a possible relationship between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the exact contribution of TBI to AD onset and progression is unclear. Hence, we examined AD-related histopathological changes and cognitive impairment after TBI in triple transgenic (3xTg)-AD model mice. Five- to seven-month-old 3xTg-AD model mice were subjected to either TBI by the weight-drop method or a sham treatment. In the 3xTg-AD mice subjected to TBI, the spatial learning was not significantly different 7 days after TBI compared to that of the sham-treated 3xTg-AD mice. However, 28 days after TBI, the 3xTg-AD mice exhibited significantly lower spatial learning than the sham-treated 3xTg-AD mice. Correspondingly, while a few amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques were observed in both sham-treated and TBI-treated 3xTg-AD mouse hippocampus 7 days after TBI, the Abeta deposition was significantly greater in 3xTg-AD mice 28 days after TBI. Thus, we demonstrated that TBI induced a significant increase in hippocampal Abeta deposition 28 days after TBI compared to that of the control animals, which was associated with worse spatial learning ability in 3xTg-AD mice. The present study suggests that TBI could be a risk factor for accelerated AD progression, particularly when genetic and hereditary predispositions are involved.",

Current diagnostic methods using sequence-specific antibodies against less toxic fibrillar and monomeric Abeta42 run the risk of overdiagnosis. Hence, conformation-specific antibodies against neurotoxic Abeta42 oligomers have garnered much attention for developing more accurate diagnostics. Antibody 24B3, highly specific for the toxic Abeta42 conformer that has a turn at Glu22 and Asp23, recognizes a putative Abeta42 dimer, which forms stable and neurotoxic oligomers more potently than the monomer. 24B3 significantly rescues Abeta42-induced neurotoxicity, whereas sequence-specific antibodies such as 4G8 and 82E1, which recognizes the N-terminus, do not. The ratio of toxic to total Abeta42 in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients is significantly higher than in control subjects as measured by sandwich ELISA using antibodies 24B3 and 82E1. Thus, 24B3 may be useful for AD diagnosis and therapy.",

Since the oligomeric forms of Abeta can vary in size and conformation, it is vital to understand the early stages of Abeta aggregation in order to improve the care and treatment of patients with AD. This is the first study to determine the effect of field amplified sample stacking (FASS) on the separation of oligomeric forms of Abeta1-42 using capillary electrophoresis (CE) with ultraviolet (UV) detection. UV-CE was able to separate two different species of Abeta1-42 oligomers (<7 mers and 7-22 mers). Although FASS required the use of a higher ionic strength buffer, Abeta1-42 oligomers had the same aggregation behavior as under the non-FASS conditions with only small changes in the amounts of oligomers observed. In general, FASS provided smaller peak widths (>75% average reduction) and increased peak heights (>60% average increase) when compared to non-FASS conditions. UV-CE with FASS also provided higher resolution between the Abeta1-42 oligomers for all aggregation time points studied. In addition, Congo red and Orange G inhibition studies were used to help evaluate the conformation of the observed species. This work demonstrates the ability of UV-CE employing FASS to provide higher resolution between oligomeric forms of Abeta1-42 without significantly altering their aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Carlina acaulis is a medicinal plant that has shown antioxidant activity in in vitro studies, but to date no corresponding in vivo data is available. Therefore, in the present study the antioxidant activity and its impact in counteracting Abeta toxicity were studied in the Caenorhabditis elegans model. A dichloromethane extract of the roots of C. acaulis was prepared and characterised via gas-liquid-chromatography/mass-spectrometry (GLC-MS). The in vitro antioxidant activity was confirmed via 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydracyl assay. The extract was further separated by thin layer chromatography into two fractions, one of which was a fraction of the dichloromethane extract of C. acaulis containing mostly Carlina oxide (CarOx). Different strains of C. elegans were employed to study the expression of hsp-16.2p::GFP as a marker for oxidative stress, delocalisation of the transcription factor DAF-16 as a possible mechanism of antioxidant activity, the effect of the drug under lethal oxidative stress, and the effect against beta-amyloid (Abeta) toxicity in a paralysis assay. The C. acaulis extract and CarOx showed high antioxidant activity (stress reduction by 47% and 64%, respectively) in C. elegans and could activate the transcription factor DAF-16 which directs the expression of anti-stress genes. In paralysis assay, only the total extract was significantly active, delaying paralysis by 1.6 h. In conclusion, in vivo antioxidant activity was shown for C. acaulis for the first time in the C. elegans model. The active antioxidant compound is Carlina oxide. This activity, however, is not sufficient to counteract Abeta toxicity. Other mechanisms and possibly other active compounds are involved in this effect.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between aggregate genetic risk and Alzheimer disease (AD) markers in stages preceding the clinical symptoms of dementia using data from 2 large observational cohort studies. METHODS: We computed polygenic risk scores (PGRS) using summary statistics from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project genome-wide association study of AD. Associations between PGRS and AD markers (cognitive decline, clinical progression, hippocampus volume, and beta-amyloid) were assessed within older participants with dementia. Associations between PGRS and hippocampus volume were additionally examined within healthy younger participants (age 18-35 years). RESULTS: Within participants without dementia, elevated PGRS was associated with worse memory (p = 0.002) and smaller hippocampus (p = 0.002) at baseline, as well as greater longitudinal cognitive decline (memory: p = 0.0005, executive function: p = 0.01) and clinical progression (p < 0.00001). High PGRS was associated with AD-like levels of beta-amyloid burden as measured with florbetapir PET (p = 0.03) but did not reach statistical significance for CSF beta-amyloid (p = 0.11). Within the younger group, higher PGRS was associated with smaller hippocampus volume (p = 0.05). This pattern was evident when examining a PGRS that included many loci below the genome-wide association study (GWAS)-level significance threshold (16,123 single nucleotide polymorphisms), but not when PGRS was restricted to GWAS-level significant loci (18 single nucleotide polymorphisms). CONCLUSIONS: Effects related to common genetic risk loci distributed throughout the genome are detectable among individuals without dementia. The influence of this genetic risk may begin in early life and make an individual more susceptible to cognitive impairment in late life. Future refinement of polygenic risk scores may help identify individuals at risk for AD dementia.",

The DUVRR spectroscopy and AFM experiments confirmed the formation of linear, unbranched and beta-sheet rich fibrils. The fibrils (Abeta40)n, formed using n monomers, were equilibrated using all-atom MD simulations. The structural properties such as beta-sheet character, twist, interstrand distance, and periodicity of these fibrils were found to be in agreement with experimental measurements. Furthermore, Young's modulus (Y) = 4.2 GPa computed using SS calculations was supported by measured values of 1.79 +- 0.41 and 3.2 +- 0.8 GPa provided by two separate AFM experiments. These results revealed size dependence of structural and material properties of amyloid fibrils and show the utility of such combined experimental and theoretical studies in the design of precisely engineered biomaterials.",

Pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferated-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist, was previously reported to enhance cognition through its effect on Abeta accumulation and clearance.

The effect of monotherapy with pioglitazone (10 mg kg(-1)) and exenatide or their combination on memory dysfunction was determined and some of the probable underlying mechanisms were studied. The current results confirmed that (1) feeding male rats with fructose syrup for 12 weeks resulted in a decline of learning and memory registered in eight-arm radial maze test; (2) treatment with pioglitazone or exenatide enhanced cognition, reduced hippocampal neurodegeneration, and reduced hippocampal microglia expression and beta amyloid oligomer deposition in a manner that is equal to monotherapies.

    "abstract": "The ratio of the longer (i.e., Abeta42/Abeta43) to shorter (i.e. Abeta40) species is a critical factor determining amyloid fibril formation, neurotoxicity and progression of the amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease. The relative levels of the different Abeta species are affected by activity and conformation of the gamma-secretase complex catalytic component - presenilin 1 (PS1). The enzyme exists in a dynamic equilibrium of the conformational states, with so-called \"close\" conformation associated with the shift of the gamma-secretase cleavage towards the production of longer, neurotoxic Abeta species. In the current study, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, spectral Forster resonance energy transfer, calcium imaging and cytotoxicity assays were utilized to explore reciprocal link between the Abeta42 and Abeta40 peptides present at various ratios and PS1 conformation in primary neurons. We report that exposure to Abeta peptides at a relatively high ratio of Abeta42/40 causes conformational change within the PS1 subdomain architecture towards the pathogenic \"closed\" state. Mechanistically, the Abeta42/40 peptides present at the relatively high ratio increase intracellular calcium levels, which were shown to trigger pathogenic PS1 conformation. This indicates that there is a reciprocal crosstalk between the extracellular Abeta peptides and PS1 conformation within a neuron, with Abeta40 showing some protective effect. The pathogenic shift within the PS1 domain architecture may further shift the production of Abeta peptides towards the longer, neurotoxic Abeta species. These findings link elevated calcium, Abeta42 and PS1/gamma-secretase conformation, and offer possible mechanistic explanation of the impending exacerbation of the amyloid pathology.",

Recently, PiB-PET imaging has been shown to be powerful to quantify amyloid-beta plaque loads leading to pathophysiological alterations in AD brains. Thus, there has been a need for serum biomarkers reflecting PiB-PET imaging data as an early diagnosis platform of AD. Here, using LC-MS/MS analysis coupled with isobaric tagging, we performed comprehensive proteome profiling of serum samples from cognitively normal controls, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD patients, who were selected using PiB-PET imaging. Comparative analysis of the proteomes revealed 79 and 72 differentially expressed proteins in MCI and AD, respectively, compared to controls. Integrated analysis of these proteins with genomic and proteomic data of AD brain tissues, together with network analysis, identified three biomarker candidates representing the altered proteolysis-related process in MCI or AD: proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), coagulation factor XIII, A1 polypeptide (F13A1), and dermcidin (DCD). In independent serum samples of MCI and AD, we confirmed the elevation of the candidates using western blotting and ELISA. Our results suggest that these biomarker candidates can serve as a potential non-invasive early diagnosis platform reflecting PiB-PET imaging for MCI and AD.",

It is suggested that exosomes play essential role in the maintenance of the neuronal functions and also in the clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) from the brain. Abeta is well known to cause neuronal cell death, whereas little is known about its effect on astrocytes. In this study, we examined the effect of Abeta on release of exosomes from astrocytes in culture. We analyzed release of exosomes and apoE, both of which are known to remove/clear Abeta from the brain, in the culture medium of astrocytes. We found that exosome and apoE-HDL were successfully separated by density gradient ultracentrifugation demonstrated by distribution of their specific markers, flotillin and HSP90, and cholesterol, and morphological analysis using electron microscopy. Exosome release was significantly reduced by Abeta1-42 treatment in cultured astrocytes accompanied by an increased JNK phosphorylation. Whereas, apoE-HDL release remained unchanged. A JNK inhibitor restored the decreased levels of exosome release induced by Abeta treatment to levels similar to those of control, suggesting that Abeta1-42 inhibits exosome release via stimulation of JNK signal pathway. Because exosomes are shown to remove Abeta in the brain, our findings suggest that increased Abeta levels in the brain may impair the exosome-mediated Abeta clearance pathway.",

    "title": "Protein Misfolding in Prion and Prion-Like Diseases: Reconsidering a Required Role for Protein Loss-of-Function.",
    "abstract": "Prion disease research has contributed much toward understanding other neurodegenerative diseases, including recent demonstrations that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases are prion-like. Prion-like diseases involve the spread of degeneration between individuals and/or among cells or tissues via template directed misfolding, wherein misfolded protein conformers propagate disease by causing normal proteins to misfold. Here we use the premise that AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and other similar diseases are prion-like and ask: Can we apply knowledge gained from studies of these prion-like diseases to resolve debates about classical prion diseases? We focus on controversies about what role(s) protein loss-of-function might have in prion diseases because this has therapeutic implications, including for AD. We examine which loss-of-function events are recognizable in prion-like diseases by considering the normal functions of the proteins before their misfolding and aggregation. We then delineate scenarios wherein gain-of-function and/or loss-of-function would be necessary or sufficient for neurodegeneration. We consider roles of PrPC loss-of-function in prion diseases and in AD, and conclude that the conventional wisdom that prion diseases are 'toxic gain-of-function diseases' has limitations. While prion diseases certainly have required gain-of-function components, we propose that disease phenotypes are predominantly caused by deficits in the normal physiology of PrPC and its interaction partners as PrPC converts to PrPSc. In this model, gain-of-function serves mainly to spread disease, and loss-of-function directly mediates neuron dysfunction. We propose experiments and predictions to assess our conclusion. Further study on the normal physiological roles of these key proteins is warranted.",

Therefore, regulation of Abeta represents a crucial treatment approach for AD. Neprilysin (NEP), a membrane metallo-endopeptidase, is a rate-limiting peptidase which is known to degrade the amyloid beta peptide. This study investigated soluble NEP (sNEP) produced by recombinant mammalian cells stably transfected with a non-viral NEP expression vector to demonstrate its protective effect against Abeta peptides in neuronal cells in vitro. Stably transfected HEK 293 cells were used to purify the soluble protein. sNEP and Abeta peptide co-treated hippocampal cells had a decreased level of Abeta peptides shown by an increase in cell viability and decrease in apoptosis measured by the CCK-8 and relative caspase-3 activity ratio assays, respectively. This study shows that stably transfected mammalian cells can produce soluble NEP proteins which could be used to protect against Abeta accumulation in AD and subsequently neuronal toxicity. Additionally, approaches using protein therapy for potential targets could change the pathological cascade of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Investigations of Abeta oligomers in neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still scarce. We report neurohistopathological and biochemical analyses using antibodies against tau and amyloid beta (Abeta) pathology. METHODS: Thirty elderly AD patients and 43 age-matched controls with or without deposition of amyloid plaques (AP) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In 21 cases with available fresh tissue, Western blots were also performed. Neuropathological analysis included quantitative assessment of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), AP and Abeta oligomer densities in the mesial temporal cortex (TC). RESULTS: NFT, fibrillar amyloid and Abeta oligomeric deposit densities were significantly higher in AD patients than in controls. There was no relationship between oligomeric Abeta densities and Braak NFT staging scores. Furthermore, Abeta oligomer expression was closely correlated with Abeta plaques in the TC. By Western blot, Abeta oligomers were observed in AD patients, in plaque-free controls, in 1 'tangle-only AD' case, as well as in the cerebellum. A band near 55 kDa was the only Western blot signal that was significantly increased in the TC of AD patients compared to controls as well as less expressed in the cerebellum. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a putative dodecamer, near 55 kDa, may contribute to AD vulnerability of the TC.",

Although much attention is paid to its role in formation of extracellular amyloid plaques and protein aggregates as well as to corresponding mechanisms of their toxicity, good evidence exists that intracellular Abeta can accumulate intraneuronally and interact with intracellular target proteins. However, intracellular Abeta binding proteins as well as conditions favoring their interactions with Abeta are poorly characterized. In this study we have investigated the effect of two known pathogenic Abeta modifications, isomerization of Asp7 and phosphorylation of Ser8, on the proteomic profiles of mouse brain Abeta binding proteins. Phosphorylation of Ser8 and especially isomerization of Asp7 significantly extended the repertoire of mouse brain Abeta binding proteins. However, there were 61 proteins, common for three types of the affinity ligands. They obviously represent potential targets for direct interaction with all Abeta species. Taking into consideration spontaneous mode of Asp7 isomerization and reports on initial accumulation of phosphorylated Abeta species inside neurons it is reasonable to suggest that these modifications of intracellular Abeta peptides causing the significant increase in the repertoire of Abeta binding proteins represent a primary pathogenic effect that precedes formation of extracellular pathogenic oligomerization/aggregation of Abeta peptides well described in the literature.",

Hence, we generated APPSWE/PS1DeltaE9 mice lacking the type-1 IFN alpha receptor-1 (IFNAR1, APPSWE/PS1DeltaE9 x IFNAR1(-/-)) aged to 9 months to investigate the role of type-1 IFN signaling in a well-validated model of AD. APPSWE/PS1DeltaE9 x IFNAR1(-/-) mice displayed a modest reduction in Abeta monomer levels, despite maintenance of plaque deposition. This finding correlated with partial rescue of spatial learning and memory impairments in the Morris water maze in comparison to APPSWE/PS1DeltaE9 mice. Q-PCR identified a reduced type-1 IFN response and modulated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in APPSWE/PS1DeltaE9 x IFNAR1(-/-) mice compared to APPSWE/PS1DeltaE9 mice. Interestingly, immunohistochemistry displayed enhanced astrocyte reactivity but attenuated microgliosis surrounding amyloid plaque deposits in APPSWE/PS1DeltaE9 x IFNAR1(-/-) mice in comparison to APPSWE/PS1DeltaE9 mice. These APPSWE/PS1DeltaE9 x IFNAR1(-/-) microglial populations demonstrated an anti-inflammatory phenotype that was confirmed in vitro by soluble Abeta1-42 treatment of IFNAR1(-/-) primary glial cultures. Our findings suggest that modulating neuro-inflammatory responses by suppressing type-1 IFN signaling may provide therapeutic benefit in AD.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate in vitro cross-seeding of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in the presence of Abeta25-35 and their cytotoxic effects on microglial cells. To investigate the cross-seeding of BSA in the presence of Abeta25-35 fibrils, we examined how Abeta25-35 fibrils can function as seeds to trigger and accelerate BSA fibrillogenesis using ThT, intrinsic fluorescence, ANS fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Moreover, the effects of these fibrils on microglial viability were measured using MTT and Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining. Although Abeta25-35 is toxic against microglia, it acted as seed and affected the aggregation pathway and accelerated the fibrillogenesis of BSA in vitro, resulted in an enhanced cytotoxic effect in comparison with Abeta25-35 or BSA alone. These observations thought to be helpful to understand the molecular mechanism of enhanced toxicity due to the coexistence of the aggregation prone proteins/peptides,. then cross-seeding effect on microglial cells that may involve in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).",

    "abstract": "Deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is a key component in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As an anti-amyloid natural polyphenol, curcumin (Cur) has been used as a therapy for AD. Its fluorescent activity, preferential binding to Abeta, as well as structural similarities with other traditional amyloid-binding dyes, make it a promising candidate for labeling and imaging of Abeta plaques in vivo. The present study was designed to test whether dietary Cur and nanocurcumin (NC) provide more sensitivity for labeling and imaging of Abeta plaques in brain tissues from the 5x-familial AD (5xFAD) mice than the classical Abeta-binding dyes, such as Congo red and Thioflavin-S. These comparisons were made in postmortem brain tissues from the 5xFAD mice. We observed that Cur and NC labeled Abeta plaques to the same degree as Abeta-specific antibody and to a greater extent than those of the classical amyloid-binding dyes. Cur and NC also labeled Abeta plaques in 5xFAD brain tissues when injected intraperitoneally. Nanomolar concentrations of Cur or NC are sufficient for labeling and imaging of Abeta plaques in 5xFAD brain tissue. Cur and NC also labeled different types of Abeta plaques, including core, neuritic, diffuse, and burned-out, to a greater degree than other amyloid-binding dyes. Therefore, Cur and or NC can be used as an alternative to Abeta-specific antibody for labeling and imaging of Abeta plaques ex vivo and in vivo. It can provide an easy and inexpensive means of detecting Abeta-plaque load in postmortem brain tissue of animal models of AD after anti-amyloid therapy.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Levels of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related proteins in plasma neuronal derived exosomes (NDEs) were quantified to identify biomarkers for prediction and staging of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. METHODS: Plasma exosomes were extracted, precipitated, and enriched for neuronal source by anti-L1CAM antibody absorption. NDEs were characterized by size (Nanosight) and shape (TEM) and extracted NDE protein biomarkers were quantified by ELISAs. Plasma NDE cargo was injected into normal mice, and results were characterized by immunohistochemistry to determine pathogenic potential. RESULTS: Plasma NDE levels of P-T181-tau, P-S396-tau, and Abeta1-42 were significantly higher, whereas those of neurogranin (NRGN) and the repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST) were significantly lower in AD and MCI converting to AD (ADC) patients compared to cognitively normal controls (CNC) subjects and stable MCI patients. Mice injected with plasma NDEs from ADC patients displayed increased P-tau (PHF-1 antibody)-positive cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus compared to plasma NDEs from CNC and stable MCI patients. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal plasma NDE levels of P-tau, Abeta1-42, NRGN, and REST accurately predict conversion of MCI to AD dementia. Plasma NDEs from demented patients seeded tau aggregation and induced AD-like neuropathology in normal mouse CNS.",

Male adult Swiss mice received amyloid-beta or saline. One day after, mice were treated with blank nanocapsules (17 ml/kg) or meloxicam-loaded nanocapsules (5 mg/kg) or free meloxicam (5 mg/kg). Treatments were performed on alternating days, until the end of the experimental protocol. In the fourteenth day, kinases activities were performed. Amyloid-beta did not change the kinases activity in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of mice. However, free meloxicam decrease the creatine kinase activity in mitochondrial-rich fraction in the group induced by amyloid-beta, but for the cytosolic fraction, it has raised in the activity of pyruvate kinase activity in cerebral cortex. Further, meloxicam-loaded nanocapsules administration reduced adenylate kinase activity in the hippocampus of mice injected by amyloid-beta. In conclusion we observed absence in short-term effects in kinases activities of energy metabolism in mice hippocampus and cerebral cortex using amyloid-beta peptide model. These findings established the foundation to further study the kinases in phosphoryltransfer network changes observed in the brains of patients post-mortem with Alzheimer's disease.",

We used a high-resolution graph-based approach to investigate local-to-local and local-to-distributed cortical associations between the maps of Tau, amyloid-beta, and gray matter intensity. Our study shows that Tau and amyloid-beta deposits are associated with distinctive spatial patterns of brain tissue loss. Moreover, Tau and amyloid-beta accumulations have strong network interdigitations in heteromodal and associative areas of the cortical mantle, particularly the inferior-lateral temporal lobe. These findings contribute significantly to our understanding of how these two main hallmarks of AD pathology propagate across the elderly human brain. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: It has been postulated that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology interacts and resides within system-level circuits of the human brain, long before the onset of cognitive symptoms. However, a side-by-side comparison of tissue loss, amyloid-beta, and Tau deposition in early stages of the disease has been precluded until the recent advent of Tau tracer-based neuroimaging. In this study, we used Tau positron emission tomography and network analyses to disentangle these pathological relationships. We found that Tau and amyloid-beta deposits are associated with distinctive spatial patterns of brain tissue loss. Moreover, we uncovered the network interdigitations of Tau and amyloid-beta in the cortical mantle. These findings contribute significantly to our understanding of how two main hallmarks of AD pathology propagate across the elderly human brain.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide of Alzheimer's disease (AD) forms polymorphic fibrils on the micrometer and molecular scales. Various fibril growth conditions have been identified to cause polymorphism, but the intrinsic amino acid sequence basis for this polymorphism has been unclear. Several single-site mutations in the center of the Abeta sequence cause different disease phenotypes and fibrillization properties. The E22G (Arctic) mutant is found in familial AD and forms protofibrils more rapidly than wild-type Abeta. Here, we use solid-state NMR spectroscopy to investigate the structure, dynamics, hydration and morphology of Arctic E22G Abeta40 fibrils. (13)C, (15)N-labeled synthetic E22G Abeta40 peptides are studied and compared with wild-type and Osaka E22Delta Abeta40 fibrils. Under the same fibrillization conditions, Arctic Abeta40 exhibits a high degree of polymorphism, showing at least four sets of NMR chemical shifts for various residues, while the Osaka and wild-type Abeta40 fibrils show a single or a predominant set of chemical shifts. Thus, structural polymorphism is intrinsic to the Arctic E22G Abeta40 sequence. Chemical shifts and inter-residue contacts obtained from 2D correlation spectra indicate that one of the major Arctic conformers has surprisingly high structural similarity with wild-type Abeta42. (13)C-(1)H dipolar order parameters, (1)H rotating-frame spin-lattice relaxation times and water-to-protein spin diffusion experiments reveal substantial differences in the dynamics and hydration of Arctic, Osaka and wild-type Abeta40 fibrils. Together, these results strongly suggest that electrostatic interactions in the center of the Abeta peptide sequence play a crucial role in the three-dimensional fold of the fibrils, and by inference, fibril-induced neuronal toxicity and AD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaOs) are the most important toxic species in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient. AbetaOs, therefore, are considered reliable molecular biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD. Herein, we reported a simple and sensitive electrochemical method for the selective detection of AbetaOs using silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as the redox reporters and PrP(95-110), an AbetaOs-specific binding peptide, as the receptor. Specifically, adamantine (Ad)-labeled PrP(95-110), denoted as Ad-PrP(95-110), induced the aggregation and color change of AgNPs and the follow-up formation of a network of Ad-PrP(95-110)-AgNPs. Then, Ad-PrP(95-110)-AgNPs were anchored onto a beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)-covered electrode surface through the host-guest interaction between Ad and beta-CD, thus producing an amplified electrochemical signal through the solid-state Ag/AgCl reaction by the AgNPs. In the presence of AbetaOs, Ad-PrP(95-110) interacted specifically with the AbetaOs, thus losing the capability to bind AgNPs and to induce the formation of an AgNPs-based network on the electrode surface. Consequently, the electrochemical signal decreased with an increase in the concentration of AbetaOs in the range of 20 pM to 100 nM. The biosensor had a detection limit of 8 pM and showed no response to amyloid-beta monomers (AbetaMs) and fibrils (AbetaFs). On the basis of the well-defined and amplified electrochemical signal of the AgNPs-based network architecture, these results should be valuable for the design of novel electrochemical biosensors by marrying specific receptors.",

    "abstract": "Published data supports the neuroprotective effects of several phenolic-containing natural products, including certain fruit, berries, spices, nuts, green tea, and olive oil. However, limited data are available for phenolic-containing plant-derived natural sweeteners including maple syrup. Herein, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of a chemically standardized phenolic-enriched maple syrup extract (MSX) using a combination of biophysical, in vitro, and in vivo studies. Based on biophysical data (Thioflavin T assay, transmission electron microscopy, circular dichroism, dynamic light scattering, and zeta potential), MSX reduced amyloid beta1-42 peptide (Abeta1-42) fibrillation in a concentration-dependent manner (50-500 mug/mL) with similar effects as the neuroprotective polyphenol, resveratrol, at its highest test concentration (63.5 % at 500 mug/mL vs. 77.3 % at 50 mug/mL, respectively). MSX (100 mug/mL) decreased H2O2-induced oxidative stress (16.1 % decrease in ROS levels compared to control), and down-regulated the production of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammatory markers (22.1, 19.9, 74.8, and 87.6 % decrease in NOS, IL-6, PGE2, and TNFalpha levels, respectively, compared to control) in murine BV-2 microglial cells. Moreover, in a non-contact co-culture cell model, differentiated human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells were exposed to conditioned media from BV-2 cells treated with MSX (100 mug/mL) and LPS or LPS alone. MSX-BV-2 media increased SH-SY5Y cell viability by 13.8 % compared to media collected from LPS-BV-2 treated cells. Also, MSX (10 mug/mL) showed protective effects against Abeta1-42 induced neurotoxicity and paralysis in Caenorhabditis elegans in vivo. These data support the potential neuroprotective effects of MSX warranting further studies on this natural product.",

    "title": "Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion induces memory deficits and facilitates Abeta generation in C57BL/6J mice.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia frequently responsible for cognitive decline in the elderly. The etiology and molecular mechanism of AD pathogenesis remain inconclusive. Aging and vascular factors are important independent causes and contributors to sporadic AD. Clinical imaging studies showed that cerebral blood flow decreases before cognitive impairment in patients with AD. To investigate the effect of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) on cognitive impairment and morphological features, we developed a new manner of CCH mouse model by narrowing bilateral common carotid arteries. Mice started to manifest spatial memory deficits 1month after the surgery and exhibited behavioral changes in a time-dependent manner. Mice also presented memory deficits accompanied with morphological changes at the neuronal and synaptic levels. CCH damaged the normal neuronal morphology and significantly reduced the expression level of PSD95. CCH activated astrocytes, increased the co-expression of GFAP and AQP4, and destroyed the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Furthermore, CCH facilitated intracellular and extracellular Abeta deposition by up-regulating gamma-secretase and beta-secretase levels. Our results showed good reproducibility of post-CCH pathological processes, which are characterized by neuronal apoptosis, axonal abnormalities, glial activation, BBB damage, amyloid deposition, and cognitive dysfunction; these processes may be used to decipher the complex interplay and pathological process between CCH and AD. This study provides laboratory evidence for the prevention and treatment of cognitive malfunction and AD.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide deposition into insoluble plaques is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but soluble oligomeric Abeta is considered to be more potent and has been hypothesized to directly impair learning and memory. Also, evidences from some clinical studies indicated that Abeta oligomer formation is the major cause for early AD onset. However, the biochemical mechanism involved in the oligomer-induced toxicity is not very well addressed. So, thise present study was undertaken to study the effects of single intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of protofibrillar Abeta 1-42 on the behavioral and biochemical profile in rats. METHODS: Rats were divided into two groups (n = 8 per group): (1) sham control group and (2) Abeta 1-42 injected group. A single dose of protofibrillar Abeta 1-42 (5 ul) through icv injection was bilaterally administered into the dorsal hippocampus, while sham control animals were administered with 5 microl of vehicle. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the protofibrillar Abeta significantly inhibited long-term memory retention and increased anxiety levels as shown by the behavioral studies. The amyloid deposits were present inside the brain even six weeks after injection as confirmed by thioflavin-T staining and the neurodegeneration induced by these deposits was confirmed by Nissl's staining in hippocampal and cortical regions. The amyloid aggregates induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, acetylcholinesterase activity, nitrite levels, lipid peroxidation, and inhibited antioxidant enzyme activity in hippocampus, cortex, and striatum regions of rat brain after six weeks. DISCUSSION: The present study indicated that protofibrillar Abeta 1-42 injection altered long term memory, induced anxiety-like behavior and also developed Alzheimer's disease like pathology in rats.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial defects including excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and compromised ATP generation are featured pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta (Abeta)-mediated mitochondrial ROS overproduction disrupts intra-neuronal Redox balance, in turn exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction leading to neuronal injury. Previous studies have found the beneficial effects of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants in preventing mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal injury in AD animal and cell models, suggesting that mitochondrial ROS scavengers hold promise for the treatment of this neurological disorder. In this study, we have determined that mitotempo, a novel mitochondria-targeted antioxidant protects mitochondrial function from the toxicity of Abeta in primary cultured neurons. Our results showed that Abeta-promoted mitochondrial superoxide production and neuronal lipid oxidation were significantly suppressed by the application of mitotempo. Moreover, mitotempo also demonstrated protective effects on mitochondrial bioenergetics evidenced by preserved mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c oxidase activity as well as ATP production. In addition, the Abeta-induced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion and decreased expression levels of mtDNA replication-related DNA polymerase gamma (DNA pol gamma) and Twinkle were substantially mitigated by mitotempo. Therefore, our study suggests that elimination of excess mitochondrial ROS rescues mitochondrial function in Abeta-insulted neruons; and mitotempo has the potential to be a promising therapeutic agent to protect mitochondrial and neuronal function in AD.",

    "abstract": "Although tight junctions between human brain microvascular endothelial cells in the blood-brain barrier prevent molecules or cells in the bloodstream from entering the brain, in Alzheimer's disease, peripheral blood monocytes can \"open\" these tight junctions and trigger subsequent transendothelial migration. However, the mechanism underlying this migration is unclear. Here, we found that the CSF2RB, but not CSF2RA, subunit of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor was overexpressed on monocytes from Alzheimer's disease patients. CSF2RB contributes to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-induced transendothelial monocyte migration. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor triggers human brain microvascular endothelial cells monolayer tight junction disassembly by downregulating ZO-1 expression via transcription modulation and claudin-5 expression via the ubiquitination pathway. Interestingly, intracerebral granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor blockade abolished the increased monocyte infiltration in the brains of APP/PS1 Alzheimer's disease model mice. Our results suggest that in Alzheimer's disease patients, high granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor levels in the brain parenchyma and cerebrospinal fluid induced blood-brain barrier opening, facilitating the infiltration of CSF2RB-expressing peripheral monocytes across blood-brain barrier and into the brain. CSF2RB might be useful as an Alzheimer's disease biomarker. Thus, our findings will help to understand the mechanism of monocyte infiltration in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the effect of cerebral amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in cognitively normal (CN) seniors on regional metabolism of specific brain regions known to be affected by p-tau deposition. METHODS: Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), volumetric magnetic resonance imaging scans, and global amyloid standardized uptake value ratios (SUVr) were obtained for 210 CNs from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-2 (ADNI2). Region of interest (ROI) extraction was used to obtain functional SUVr from six bilateral ROIs: amygdala (AM), entorhinal cortex (EC), hippocampus, lateral orbitofrontal, posterior cingulate (PC), and middle temporal gyrus. Every metabolic SUVr set was averaged and analyzed against the corresponding subject's amyloid SUVr. Correlation analyses were conducted on the full group and between APOE epsilon4-positive and APOE epsilon4-negative subgroups. RESULTS: The APOE epsilon4+ group exhibited significantly higher metabolism in the EC (r = 0.270, P = .038) and AM (r = 0.267, P = .041). When a significance of the difference test was conducted between the APOE epsilon4+ and APOE epsilon4-groups, these same regions remained significant: P = .012 and P = .016, respectively. By contrast, the APOE epsilon4 group displayed only the conventionally expected result of reduced regional metabolism in the PC (r = -0.161, P = .048), with higher Abeta load. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of amyloid positivity on brain metabolism is regionally specific, and APOE epsilon4 status substantially modulates regional glucose uptake in these regions. The APOE epsilon4 allele may cause earlier emergence of clinical symptoms in AD via a mechanism that influences regional metabolic demand in specifically those regions where p-tau deposition is known to occur earliest.",

    "abstract": "The most important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is aging. Neurotoxicity in AD has been linked to dyshomeostasis of intracellular Ca2+ induced by small aggregates of the amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta42 oligomers). However, how aging influences susceptibility to neurotoxicity induced by Abeta42 oligomers is unknown. In this study, we used long-term cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, a model of neuronal in vitro aging, to investigate the contribution of aging to Ca2+ dishomeostasis and neuron cell death induced by Abeta42 oligomers. In addition, we tested whether non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and R-flurbiprofen prevent apoptosis acting on subcellular Ca2+ in aged neurons. We found that Abeta42 oligomers have no effect on young hippocampal neurons cultured for 2 days in vitro (2 DIV). However, they promoted apoptosis modestly in mature neurons (8 DIV) and these effects increased dramatically after 13 DIV, when neurons display many hallmarks of in vivo aging. Consistently, cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ responses induced by Abeta42 oligomers increased dramatically with culture age. At low concentrations, NSAIDs and the enantiomer R-flurbiprofen lacking anti-inflammatory activity prevent Ca2+ overload and neuron cell death induced by Abeta42 oligomers in aged neurons. However, at high concentrations R-flurbiprofen induces apoptosis. Thus, Abeta42 oligomers promote Ca2+ overload and neuron cell death only in aged rat hippocampal neurons. These effects are prevented by low concentrations of NSAIDs and R-flurbiprofen acting on mitochondrial Ca2+ overload.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is increasing interest in targeting hyperphosphorylated tau (h-tau) as a disease modifying approach for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sodium selenate directly stimulates the activity of PP2A, the main enzyme responsible for h-tau dephosphorylation in the brain. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the safety and tolerability of 24-week treatment with VEL015 (sodium selenate) in AD. Investigating the effects of VEL015 on cognitive, CSF, and neuroimaging biomarkers of AD were secondary, exploratory objectives. Data were used to identify biomarkers showing most promise for use in subsequent efficacy trials. METHODS: A 24-week, multicenter, Phase IIa, double-blinded randomized controlled trial. Forty patients aged >=55 y with mild-moderate AD (MMSE 14-26) were randomized to supranutritional (VEL015 10 mg tds [n = 20]) and control (VEL015 320mug tds [n = 10] or placebo [n = 10]) groups. Patients were regularly monitored for safety, adverse events (AEs), and protocol compliance. Exploratory biomarkers included cognitive tests, neuroimaging (diffusion MR), and CSF (p-tau, t-tau, and Abeta1-42). RESULTS: Thirty-six (90%; [supranutritional n = 18, control/placebo n = 18]) patients completed the trial. There were no differences in the incidence of specific AEs between groups. Only one secondary biomarker, diffusion MR measures, showed group differences, with less deterioration in the supranutritional group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Treatment with VEL015 at doses up to 30 mg per day for 24 weeks was safe and well-tolerated in patients with AD. Diffusion MR measures appear to be the most sensitive biomarkers to assess disease progression over 24 weeks.",

    "title": "Amyloid beta Protein Aggravates Neuronal Senescence and Cognitive Deficits in 5XFAD Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyloid beta (Abeta) has been established as a key factor for the pathological changes in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cellular senescence is closely associated with aging and cognitive impairment. However, it remains blurred whether, in the AD brains, Abeta accelerates the neuronal senescence and whether this senescence, in turn, impairs the cognitive function. This study aimed to explore the expression of senescence-associated genes in the hippocampal tissue from young to aged 5XFAD mice and their age-matched wild type (WT) mice to determine whether senescent neurons are present in the transgenic AD mouse model. METHODS: The 5XFAD mice and age-matched wild type mice, both raised from 1 to 18 months, were enrolled in the study. The senescence-associated genes in the hippocampus were analyzed and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cognitive performance of the mice was evaluated by Y-maze and Morris water maze tests. Oligomeric Abeta (oAbeta) (1-42) was applied to culture primary neurons to simulate the in vivo manifestation. Aging-related proteins were detected by Western blotting analysis and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: In 5XFAD mice, of all the DEGs, the senescence-associated marker p16 was most significantly increased, even at the early age. It was mainly localized in neurons, with a marginal expression in astrocytes (labeled as glutamine synthetase), nil expression in activated microglia (labeled as Iba1), and negatively correlated with the spatial cognitive impairments of 5XFAD mice. oAbeta (1-42) induced the production of senescence-related protein p16, but not p53 in vitro, which was in line with the in vivo manifestation. CONCLUSIONS: oAbeta-accelerated neuronal senescence may be associated with the cognitive impairment in 5XFAD mice. Senescence-associated marker p16 can serve as an indicator to estimate the cognitive prognosis for AD population.",

    "abstract": "While the development of AIE (aggregation-induced-emission) based fluorimetric probes for biological applications has been an active research area, probes with a ratiometric signal for biomolecular recognition have been rare. Here, a ratiometric AIE glyconanoparticle formed by the supramolecular assembly between a silole-based AIEgen and fluorescent glycoprobes for the detection of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides and fibrils, which are a signature of neurological disorders such as the Alzheimer's disease, is shown. Complexation of glycoprobes with the AIEgen produces an intensive fluorescence emission of the former because of a Forster resonance energy transfer between the two molecules. Subsequently, the presence of Abeta dissembles the particle, producing a fluorescence emission of the AIEgen. Interestingly, the addition of lectins that selectively recognize the glycoprobes results in a different ratiometric response of the particle, thereby enabling a discrimination from Abeta detection. This research offers insight into the simple construction of multifunctional ratiometric probes based on the supramolecular hybridization of a wide variety of AIEgens with fluorescent molecular probes.",

    "title": "Evaluation of Tau Imaging in Staging Alzheimer Disease and Revealing Interactions Between beta-Amyloid and Tauopathy.",
    "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: In vivo tau imaging may become a diagnostic marker for Alzheimer disease (AD) and provides insights into the pathophysiology of AD. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of [18F]-AV-1451 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to stage AD and assess the associations among beta-amyloid (Abeta), tau, and volume loss. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An imaging study conducted at Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri. A total of 59 participants who were cognitively normal (CN) (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] score, 0) or had AD dementia (CDR score, >0) were included. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) of [18F]-AV-1451 in the hippocampus and a priori-defined AD cortical signature regions, cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42, hippocampal volume, and AD signature cortical thickness. RESULTS: Of the 59 participants, 38 (64%) were male; mean (SD) age was 74 (6) years. The [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR in the hippocampus and AD cortical signature regions distinguished AD from CN participants (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve range [95% CI], 0.89 [0.73-1.00] to 0.98 [0.92-1.00]). An [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR cutoff value of 1.19 (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 86%) from AD cortical signature regions best separated cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42-positive (Abeta+) AD from cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42-negative (Abeta-) CN participants. This same cutoff also divided Abeta+ CN participants into low vs high tau groups. Moreover, the presence of Abeta+ was associated with an elevated [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR in AD cortical signature regions (Abeta+ participants: mean [SD], 1.3 [0.3]; Abeta- participants: 1.1 [0.1]; F = 4.3, P = .04) but not in the hippocampus. The presence of Abeta+ alone was not related to hippocampal volume or AD signature cortical thickness. An elevated [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR was associated with volumetric loss in both the hippocampus and AD cortical signature regions. The observed [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR volumetric association was modified by Abeta status in the hippocampus but not in AD cortical signature regions. An inverse association between hippocampal [18F]-AV-1451 SUVR and volume was seen in Abeta+ participants (R2 = 0.55; P < .001) but not Abeta- (R2 = 0; P = .97) participants. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Use of [18F]-AV-1451 has a potential for staging of the preclinical and clinical phases of AD. beta-Amyloid interacts with hippocampal and cortical tauopathy to affect neurodegeneration. In the absence of Abeta, hippocampal tau deposition may be insufficient for the neurodegenerative process that leads to AD.",

    "title": "Longitudinal noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging of brain microhemorrhages in BACE inhibitor-treated APP transgenic mice.",
    "abstract": "Currently, several immunotherapies and BACE (Beta Site APP Cleaving Enzyme) inhibitor approaches are being tested in the clinic for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. A crucial mechanism-related safety concern is the exacerbation of microhemorrhages, which are already present in the majority of Alzheimer patients. To investigate potential safety liabilities of long-term BACE inhibitor therapy, we used aged amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice (APP23), which robustly develop cerebral amyloid angiopathy. T2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a translational method applicable in preclinical and clinical studies, was used for the detection of microhemorrhages throughout the entire brain, with subsequent histological validation. Three-dimensional reconstruction based on in vivo MRI and serial Perls' stained sections demonstrated a one-to-one matching of the lesions thus allowing for their histopathological characterization. MRI detected small Perls' positive areas with a high spatial resolution. Our data demonstrate that volumetric assessment by noninvasive MRI is well suited to monitor cerebral microhemorrhages in vivo. Furthermore, 3 months treatment of aged APP23 with the potent BACE-inhibitor NB-360 did not exacerbate microhemorrhages in contrast to Abeta-antibody beta1. These results substantiate the safe use of BACE inhibitors regarding microhemorrhages in long-term clinical studies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), cognitive deficits and psychological symptoms are associated with an early deregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Here, in an acute model of AD, we investigated if antiglucocorticoid strategies with selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulators (CORT108297 and CORT113176) that combine antagonistic and agonistic GR properties could offer an interesting therapeutic approach in the future. We confirm the expected properties of the nonselective GR antagonist (mifepristone) because in addition to restoring basal circulating glucocorticoids levels, mifepristone totally reverses synaptic deficits and hippocampal apoptosis processes. However, mifepristone only partially reverses cognitive deficit, effects of the hippocampal amyloidogenic pathway, and neuroinflammatory processes, suggesting limits in its efficacy. By contrast, selective GR modulators CORT108297 and CORT113176 at a dose of 20 and 10 mg/kg, respectively, reverse hippocampal amyloid-beta peptide generation, neuroinflammation, and apoptotic processes, restore the hippocampal levels of synaptic markers, re-establish basal plasma levels of glucocorticoids, and improve cognitive function. In conclusion, selective GR modulators are particularly attractive and may pave the way to new strategies for AD treatment.",

This work describes our studies on potential mechanisms of AL cytotoxicity. We have studied the internalization of AL soluble proteins and amyloid fibrils into human AC16 cardiomyocytes by using real time live cell image analysis. Our results show how external amyloid aggregates rapidly surround the cells and act as a recruitment point for soluble protein, triggering the amyloid fibril elongation. Soluble protein and external aggregates are internalized into AC16 cells via macropinocytosis. AL amyloid fibrils are shown to be highly cytotoxic at low concentrations. Additionally, caspase assays revealed soluble protein induces apoptosis, demonstrating different cytotoxic mechanisms between soluble protein and amyloid aggregates. This study emphasizes the complex immunoglobulin light chain-cell interactions that result in fibril internalization, protein recruitment, and cytotoxicity that may occur in AL amyloidosis.",

Although it has been generally recognized that the fibrillation process can be assisted or accelerated by surface chemistry, the impact of surface topography, i.e., roughness, on peptide fibrillation is relatively little understood. Here we study the role of surface roughness on surface-mediated fibrillation using polymer coatings of varying roughness as well as polymer microparticles. Using single-molecule tracking, atomic force microscopy, and the thioflavin T fluorescence technique, we show that a rough surface decelerates the two-dimensional (2D) diffusion of peptides and retards the surface-mediated fibrillation. A higher degree of roughness that presents an obstacle to peptide diffusion is found to inhibit the fibrillation process.",

Recently, genome-wide association studies in late-onset AD patients have identified the endocytosis-related phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) gene as a genetic risk factor for AD. We previously found that the loss of expression of CALM protein encoded by PICALM affects the ratio of production of Abeta42, through the regulation of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis of gamma-secretase. Here, we show that the binding capacity of the assembly protein 180 N-terminal homology (ANTH) domain of CALM to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate, as well as to nicastrin, is critical to the modulation of the internalization of gamma-secretase and to the Abeta42 production ratio. Moreover, reduction of CALM decreases Abeta deposition as well as brain levels of insoluble Abeta42 in vivo These results suggest that CALM expression modifies AD risk by regulating Abeta pathology.",

Although the involvement of alpha-syn has been investigated extensively in Lewy body disease, less is known about the role of this synaptic protein in AD. Here, we found that reducing endogenous alpha-syn in an APP transgenic mouse model of AD prevented the degeneration of cholinergic neurons, ameliorated corresponding deficits, and recovered the levels of Rab3a and Rab5 proteins involved in intracellular transport and sorting of nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor.

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Proteolytic generation of amyloidogenic amyloid beta (Abeta) fragments from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) significantly contributes to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although amyloidogenic APP proteolysis can be affected by trafficking through genetically associated AD components such as SORLA, how SORLA functionally interacts with other trafficking components is yet unclear. Here, we report that SNX27, an endosomal trafficking/recycling factor and a negative regulator of the gamma-secretase complex, binds to the SORLA cytosolic tail to form a ternary complex with APP. SNX27 enhances cell surface SORLA and APP levels in human cell lines and mouse primary neurons, and depletion of SNX27 or SORLA reduces APP endosome-to-cell surface recycling kinetics. SNX27 overexpression enhances the generation of cell surface APP cleavage products such as soluble alpha-APP C-terminal fragment (CTFalpha) in a SORLA-dependent manner. SORLA-mediated Abeta reduction is attenuated by downregulation of SNX27. This indicates that an SNX27/SORLA complex functionally interacts to limit APP distribution to amyloidogenic compartments, forming a non-amyloidogenic shunt to promote APP recycling to the cell surface. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Many genes have been identified as risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and a large proportion of these genes function to limit production or toxicity of the AD-associated amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide. Whether and how these genes precisely operate to limit AD onset remains an important question. We identify binding and trafficking interactions between two of these factors, SORLA and SNX27, and demonstrate that SNX27 can direct trafficking of SORLA and the Abeta precursor APP to the cell surface to limit the production of Abeta. Diversion APP to the cell surface through modulation of this molecular complex may represent a complimentary strategy for future development in AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess seizure frequency in a large French cohort of autosomal dominant early-onset Alzheimer disease (ADEOAD) and to determine possible correlations with causative mutations. METHODS: A national multicentric study was performed in patients with ADEOAD harboring a pathogenic mutation within PSEN1, PSEN2, APP, or a duplication of APP, and a minimal follow-up of 5 years. Clinical, EEG, and imaging data were systematically recorded. RESULTS: We included 132 patients from 77 families: 94 PSEN1 mutation carriers (MCs), 16 APP duplication carriers, 15 APP MCs, and 7 PSEN2 MCs. Seizure frequency was 47.7% after a mean follow-up of 8.4 years (range 5-25). After 5-year follow-up and using a Cox model analysis, the percentages of patients with seizures were respectively 19.1% (10.8%-26.7%) for PSEN1, 28.6% (0%-55.3%) for PSEN2, 31.2% (4.3%-50.6%) for APP duplications, and no patient for APP mutation. APP duplication carriers showed a significantly increased seizure risk compared to both APP MCs (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.55 [95% confidence interval 1.87-16.44]) and PSEN1 MCs (HR = 4.46 [2.11-9.44]). Among all PSEN1 mutations, those within the domains of protein hydrophilic I, transmembrane II (TM-II), TM-III, TM-IV, and TM-VII were associated with a significant increase in seizure frequency compared to other domains (HR = 4.53 [1.93-10.65], p = 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: Seizures are a common feature of ADEOAD. In this population, risk was significantly higher in the APP duplication group than in all other groups. Within PSEN1, 5 specific domains were associated with a higher seizure risk indicating specific correlations between causative mutation and seizures.",

Although the two predominant forms, Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42), differ in only two residues, they display different biophysical, biological, and clinical behavior. Abeta(1-42) is the more neurotoxic species, aggregates much faster, and dominates in senile plaque of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Although small Abeta oligomers are believed to be the neurotoxic species, Abeta amyloid fibrils are, because of their presence in plaques, a pathological hallmark of AD and appear to play an important role in disease progression through cell-to-cell transmissibility. Here, we solved the 3D structure of a disease-relevant Abeta(1-42) fibril polymorph, combining data from solid-state NMR spectroscopy and mass-per-length measurements from EM. The 3D structure is composed of two molecules per fibril layer, with residues 15-42 forming a double-horseshoe-like cross-beta-sheet entity with maximally buried hydrophobic side chains. Residues 1-14 are partially ordered and in a beta-strand conformation, but do not display unambiguous distance restraints to the remainder of the core structure.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is histopathologically characterized by neurodegeneration, the formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular Abeta deposits that derive from proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). As rodents do not normally develop Abeta pathology, various transgenic animal models of AD were designed to overexpress human APP with mutations favouring its amyloidogenic processing. However, these mouse models display tremendous differences in the spatial and temporal appearance of Abeta deposits, synaptic dysfunction, neurodegeneration and the manifestation of learning deficits which may be caused by age-related and brain region-specific differences in APP transgene levels. Consequentially, a comparative temporal and regional analysis of the pathological effects of Abeta in mouse brains is difficult complicating the validation of therapeutic AD treatment strategies in different mouse models. To date, no antibodies are available that properly discriminate endogenous rodent and transgenic human APP in brains of APP-transgenic animals. Here, we developed and characterized rat monoclonal antibodies by immunohistochemistry and Western blot that detect human but not murine APP in brains of three APP-transgenic mouse and one APP-transgenic rat model. We observed remarkable differences in expression levels and brain region-specific expression of human APP among the investigated transgenic mouse lines. This may explain the differences between APP-transgenic models mentioned above. Furthermore, we provide compelling evidence that our new antibodies specifically detect endogenous human APP in immunocytochemistry, FACS and immunoprecipitation. Hence, we propose these antibodies as standard tool for monitoring expression of endogenous or transfected APP in human cells and APP expression in transgenic animals.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers represent a promising biomarker for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, state-of-the-art methods for immunodetection of Abeta oligomers in body fluids show a large variability and lack a reliable and stable standard that enables the reproducible quantitation of Abeta oligomers. At present, the only available standard applied in these assays is based on a random aggregation process of synthetic Abeta and has neither a defined size nor a known number of epitopes. In this report, we generated a highly stable standard in the size range of native Abeta oligomers that exposes a defined number of epitopes. The standard consists of a silica nanoparticle (SiNaP), which is functionalized with Abeta peptides on its surface (Abeta-SiNaP). The different steps of Abeta-SiNaP synthesis were followed by microscopic, spectroscopic and biochemical analyses. To investigate the performance of Abeta-SiNaPs as an appropriate standard in Abeta oligomer immunodetection, Abeta-SiNaPs were diluted in cerebrospinal fluid and quantified down to a concentration of 10 fM in the sFIDA (surface-based fluorescence intensity distribution analysis) assay. This detection limit corresponds to an Abeta concentration of 1.9 ng l-1 and lies in the sensitivity range of currently applied diagnostic tools based on Abeta oligomer quantitation. Thus, we developed a highly stable and well-characterized standard for the application in Abeta oligomer immunodetection assays that finally allows the reproducible quantitation of Abeta oligomers down to single molecule level and provides a fundamental improvement for the worldwide standardization process of diagnostic methods in AD research.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dementia and abnormal deposits of aggregated amyloid-beta in the brain. Recent genome-wide association studies have revealed that ABCA7 is strongly associated with AD. In vitro evidence suggests that the role of ABCA7 is related to phagocytic activity. Deletion of ABCA7 in a mouse model of AD exacerbates cerebral amyloid-beta plaque load. However, the biological role of ABCA7 in AD brain pathogenesis is unknown. We show that ABCA7 is highly expressed in microglia and when monocytes are differentiated into macrophages. We hypothesized that ABCA7 plays a protective role in the brain that is related to phagocytic clearance of amyloid-beta. We isolated microglia and macrophages from Abca7-/- and wild type mice and tested them for their capacity to phagocytose amyloid-beta oligomers. We found that the phagocytic clearance of amyloid-beta was substantially reduced in both microglia and macrophages from Abca7-/- mice compared to wild type mice. Consistent with these results, in vivo phagocytic clearance of amyloid-beta oligomers in the hippocampus was reduced in Abca7-/- mice. Furthermore, ABCA7 transcription was upregulated in AD brains and in amyloidogenic mouse brains specifically in the hippocampus as a response to the amyloid-beta pathogenic state. Together these results indicate that ABCA7 mediates phagocytic clearance of amyloid-beta in the brain, and reveal a mechanism by which loss of function of ABCA7 increases the susceptibility to AD.",

Moreover, recent evidence indicates that chaperones can act as potentially strong suppressor agents in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Indeed, in vitro experiments demonstrate that several chaperones are able to significantly slow down or suppress aggregation of Abeta peptide and in vivo studies reveal that treatment with specific chaperones or their overexpression can ameliorate some distinct pathological signs characterizing AD. METHODS: Here we investigate using a biophysical approach (fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD), transmission electron (TEM) and atomic force (AFM) microscopy, size exclusion chromatography (SEC)) the effect of the human chaperonin Hsp60 on Abeta fibrillogenesis. RESULTS: We found that Hsp60 powerfully inhibits Abeta amyloid aggregation, by closing molecular pathways leading to peptide fibrillogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: We observe that Hsp60 inhibits Abeta aggregation through a more complex mechanism than a simple folding chaperone action. The action is specifically directed toward the early oligomeric species behaving as aggregation seeds for on-pathway amyloid fibrillogenesis. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding the specificity of the molecular interactions of Hsp60 with amyloid Abeta peptide allowed us to emphasize the important aspects to be taken into consideration when considering the recent promising therapeutic strategies for neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular risk factors are associated with an increased risk of dementia. We assessed whether a multidomain intervention targeting these factors can prevent dementia in a population of community-dwelling older people. METHODS: In this open-label, cluster-randomised controlled trial, we recruited individuals aged 70-78 years through participating general practices in the Netherlands. General practices within each health-care centre were randomly assigned (1:1), via a computer-generated randomisation sequence, to either a 6-year nurse-led, multidomain cardiovascular intervention or control (usual care). The primary outcomes were cumulative incidence of dementia and disability score (Academic Medical Center Linear Disability Score [ALDS]) at 6 years of follow-up. The main secondary outcomes were incident cardiovascular disease and mortality. Outcome assessors were masked to group assignment. Analyses included all participants with available outcome data. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN29711771. FINDINGS: Between June 7, 2006, and March 12, 2009, 116 general practices (3526 participants) within 26 health-care centres were recruited and randomly assigned: 63 (1890 participants) were assigned to the intervention group and 53 (1636 participants) to the control group. Primary outcome data were obtained for 3454 (98%) participants; median follow-up was 6 7 years (21 341 person-years). Dementia developed in 121 (7%) of 1853 participants in the intervention group and in 112 (7%) of 1601 participants in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0 92, 95% CI 0 71-1 19; p=0 54). Mean ALDS scores measured during follow-up did not differ between groups (85 7 [SD 6 8] in the intervention group and 85 7 [7 1] in the control group; adjusted mean difference -0 02, 95% CI -0 38 to 0 42; p=0 93). 309 (16%) of 1885 participants died in the intervention group, compared with 269 (16%) of 1634 participants in the control group (HR 0 98, 95% CI 0 80-1 18; p=0 81). Incident cardiovascular disease did not differ between groups (273 [19%] of 1469 participants in the intervention group and 228 [17%] of 1307 participants in the control group; HR 1 06, 95% CI 0 86-1 31; p=0 57). INTERPRETATION: A nurse-led, multidomain intervention did not result in a reduced incidence of all-cause dementia in an unselected population of older people. This absence of effect might have been caused by modest baseline cardiovascular risks and high standards of usual care. Future studies should assess the efficacy of such interventions in selected populations.

A universal Calpha-trace Landau free energy is deduced from general symmetry considerations, with the ensuing all-atom structure modeled using publicly available reconstruction programs Pulchra and Scwrl. As an example, the conformational stability of an amyloid precursor protein intra-cellular domain (AICD) is inspected; the reference conformation is the crystallographic structure with code 3DXC in Protein Data Bank (PDB) that describes a heterodimer of AICD and a nuclear multi-domain adaptor protein Fe65. Those conformations of AICD that correspond to local or near-local minima of the Landau free energy are identified. For this, the response of the original 3DXC conformation to variations in the ambient temperature is investigated, using the Glauber algorithm. The conclusion is that in isolation the AICD conformation in 3DXC must be unstable. A family of degenerate conformations that minimise the Landau free energy is identified, and it is proposed that the native state of an isolated AICD is a superposition of these conformations. The results are fully in line with the presumed intrinsically unstructured character of isolated AICD and should provide a basis for a systematic analysis of AICD structure in future NMR experiments.",

ApoE4 is more susceptible to proteolysis than apoE2 and apoE3 isoforms and carboxyl-terminal truncated apoE4 forms have been found in AD patients' brain. We have previously shown that a specific apoE4 fragment, apoE4-165, promotes amyloid-peptide beta 42 (Abeta42) accumulation in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species formation, two events considered to occur early in AD pathogenesis. Here, we show that these effects are allele-dependent and absolutely require the apoE4 background. Furthermore, the exact length of the fragment is critical since longer or shorter length carboxyl-terminal truncated apoE4 forms do not elicit the same effects. Structural and thermodynamic analyses showed that apoE4-165 has a compact structure, in contrast to other carboxyl-terminal truncated apoE4 forms that are instead destabilized. Compared however to other allelic backgrounds, apoE4-165 is structurally distinct and less thermodynamically stable suggesting that the combination of a well-folded structure with structural plasticity is a unique characteristic of this fragment. Overall, our findings suggest that the ability of apoE fragments to promote Abeta42 intraneuronal accumulation is specific for both the apoE4 isoform and the particular structural and thermodynamic properties of the fragment.",

Starting from an unbiased protein microarray screen, we identified a set of lipoprotein particles (including LDL) and apolipoproteins (including CLU/APOJ and APOE) as ligands of TREM2. Binding of these ligands by TREM2 was abolished or reduced by disease-associated mutations. Overexpression of wild-type TREM2 was sufficient to enhance uptake of LDL, CLU, and APOE in heterologous cells, whereas TREM2 disease variants were impaired in this activity. Trem2 knockout microglia showed reduced internalization of LDL and CLU. beta-amyloid (Abeta) binds to lipoproteins and this complex is efficiently taken up by microglia in a TREM2-dependent fashion. Uptake of Abeta-lipoprotein complexes was reduced in macrophages from human subjects carrying a TREM2 AD variant.

    "title": "Vitamin D2 suppresses amyloid-beta 25-35 induced microglial activation in BV2 cells by blocking the NF-kappaB inflammatory signaling pathway.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: Present emerging world is emphasizing the implication of vitamin D deficiency associated with development of inflammation and neurodegenerative disorder like Alzheimer's disease (AD). The chief neuropathological hallmark of AD is aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides surrounding microglial cells in human brain. Microglial activation plays a key role in inflammatory response and neuronal injury. Naturally abundant vitamin D2 (VD2) exhibiting anti-inflammatory activities are yet to explore more. This study has investigated the inhibitory effect of VD2 on inflammatory activities of BV2 microglial cells. MAIN METHODS: Cellular compatibility of VD2 and Abeta25-35 protein in treated BV2 microglial cells were measured by CCK-8 assay. Induction of iNOS, COX-2 and NF-kappaB signaling cascade were measured by western blotting, whereas pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA. In addition, generation of ROS was detected by fluorescence intensity. KEY FINDINGS: Morphological observations showed that Abeta25-35 induced BV2 cells stimulation noticeably got reduced in VD2 pre-treated group at 24h time period. Anti-inflammatory activities of VD2 was observed demonstrating the inhibition of up-regulated iNOS and COX-2 protein expression further confirmed by attenuating the activated microglia released pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF- alpha and ROS, while blocking the phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 in nucleus by preventing IkappaB-alpha degradation and phosphorylation in cytosol. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study revealed that VD2 blocked the phosphorylation of NF-kappaB inflammatory signaling pathway in Abeta25-35 induced activated BV2 microglial cells by suppressing ROS generation and inflammatory cytokines. Our finding suggests that vitamin D2 has therapeutic potential against inflammation and Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Clearance of misfolded and aggregated proteins is central to cell survival. Here, we describe a new pathway for maintaining protein homeostasis mediated by the proteasome shuttle factor UBQLN2. The 26S proteasome degrades polyubiquitylated substrates by recognizing them through stoichiometrically bound ubiquitin receptors, but substrates are also delivered by reversibly bound shuttles. We aimed to determine why these parallel delivery mechanisms exist and found that UBQLN2 acts with the HSP70-HSP110 disaggregase machinery to clear protein aggregates via the 26S proteasome. UBQLN2 recognizes client-bound HSP70 and links it to the proteasome to allow for the degradation of aggregated and misfolded proteins. We further show that this process is active in the cell nucleus, where another system for aggregate clearance, autophagy, does not act. Finally, we found that mutations in UBQLN2, which lead to neurodegeneration in humans, are defective in chaperone binding, impair aggregate clearance, and cause cognitive deficits in mice.",

    "abstract": "The abnormal regulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) metabolism (e.g., production, cleavage, clearance) plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among endogenous factors believed to participate in AD progression are the small regulatory non-coding microRNAs (miRs). In particular, the miR-132/212 cluster is severely reduced in the AD brain. In previous studies we have shown that miR-132/212 deficiency in mice leads to impaired memory and enhanced Tau pathology as seen in AD patients. Here we demonstrate that the genetic deletion of miR-132/212 promotes Abeta production and amyloid (senile) plaque formation in triple transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice. Using RNA-Seq and bioinformatics, we identified genes of the miR-132/212 network with documented roles in the regulation of Abeta metabolism, including Tau, Mapk, and Sirt1. Consistent with these findings, we show that the modulation of miR-132, or its target Sirt1, can directly regulate Abeta production in cells. Finally, both miR-132 and Sirt1 levels correlated with Abeta load in humans. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that the miR-132/212 network, including Sirt1 and likely other target genes, contributes to abnormal Abeta metabolism and senile plaque deposition in AD. This study strengthens the importance of miR-dependent networks in neurodegenerative disorders, and opens the door to multifactorial drug targets of AD by targeting Abeta and Tau.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms leading to amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation in sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) are unknown but both increased production or impaired clearance likely contribute to aggregation. To understand the potential roles of the extracellular matrix proteoglycan Testican-1 in the pathophysiology of AD, we used samples from AD patients and controls and an in vitro approach. Protein expression analysis showed increased levels of Testican-1 in frontal and temporal cortex of AD patients; histological analysis showed that Testican-1 accumulates and co-aggregates with Abeta plaques in the frontal, temporal and entorhinal cortices of AD patients. Proteomic analysis identified 10 fragments of Testican-1 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from AD patients. HEK293T cells expressing human wild type or mutant Abeta precursor protein (APP) were transfected with Testican-1. The co-expression of both proteins modified the sorting of Testican-1 into the endocytic pathway leading to its transient accumulation in Golgi, which seemed to affect APP processing, as indicated by reduced Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels in APP mutant cells. In conclusion, patient data reflect a clearance impairment that may favor Abeta accumulation in AD brains and our in vitro model supports the notion that the interaction between APP and Testican-1 may be a key step in the production and aggregation of Abeta species.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused due to aggregation of Abeta peptides in the brain tissues. Recently, several studies on AD transgenic mice have shown the effect of caffeine in significantly reducing the Abeta amyloid level in their brains. However, the mechanism and mode of caffeine action on amyloid aggregation are not known. Therefore, in this study, we have carried out molecular dynamics simulations of five amyloid-forming Abeta16-22 peptides in pure water and in a regime of caffeine solutions, with different caffeine/peptide stoichiometric ratios. The secondary structure analyses of peptides in pure water show the formation of beta-sheet conformations, whereas on addition of caffeine, these ordered conformations become negligible. The radial distribution function, contact map, nonbonding interaction energy, hydrogen bonding, potential of mean force, and hydration analyses show that there is less interpeptide interaction in the presence of caffeine, and the effect is greater with an increasing caffeine ratio. The interaction of aromatic phenylalanine residues of peptides with caffeine restricts the interpeptide interaction tendency. Upon increasing the number of caffeine molecules, interaction of caffeine with other hydrophobic residues also increases. Thus, the hydrophobic core-recognition motif of amyloid formation of peptides is physically blocked by caffeine, thereby abolishing the self-assembly formation.",

    "abstract": "A high co-morbidity between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression suggests there might be similar mechanisms underlying the course of these diseases. Previous studies have shown that p38MAPK plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of AD and depression. However, little is known about whether SB203580, a selective inhibitor of p38MAPK, may protect against AD-associated cognitive impairments and depression-like behavior, simultaneously. Herein, we have shown, for the first time, that SB203580 may reverse memory impairments and depression-like behavior induced by hippocampal infusion of beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42), as measured by novel object recognition, Morris water maze, tail-suspension and forced-swimming tests. In addition, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator which also activates p38MAPK, significantly abolished the effects of SB203580. Moreover, Abeta1-42 causes increased phosphorylation of p38MAPK and decreased phosphorylation of Ser9-glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus of mice, which could be significantly reversed by SB203580. Our results suggest that SB203580 reversed Abeta1-42-induced cognitive impairments and depression-like behavior via inhibiting p38MAPK signaling pathway, which not only supports p38MAPK as a therapeutic target for AD-associated cognitive dysfunction and depression-like behavior, but also provides experimental basis for the use of SB203580 in co-morbidity of AD and depression.",

    "abstract": "Understanding protein amyloidogenesis is an important topic in protein science, fueled by the role of amyloid aggregates, especially oligomers, in the etiology of a number of devastating human degenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms that determine the formation of amyloid oligomers remain elusive due to the high complexity of the amyloidogenesis process. For instance, gold nanoparticles promote or inhibit amyloid fibrillation. We have functionalized gold nanorods with a metal-chelating group to selectively immobilize soluble RepA-WH1, a model synthetic bacterial prionoid, using a hexa-histidine tag (H6). H6-RepA-WH1 undergoes stable amyloid oligomerization in the presence of catalytic concentrations of anisotropic nanoparticles. Then, in a physically separated event, such oligomers promote the growth of amyloid fibers of untagged RepA-WH1. SERS spectral changes of H6-RepA-WH1 on spherical citrate-AuNP substrates provide evidence for structural modifications in the protein, which are compatible with a gradual increase in beta-sheet structure, as expected in amyloid oligomerization.",

    "abstract": "The effects of the two phenylalanine (Phe) residues in the blocked Abeta(16-22) peptide on its self-assembly have been investigated by replacing both of them with two cyclohexylalanines (Chas) or two phenylglycines (Phgs). TEM and SANS studies revealed that the flat and wide nanoribbons of Abeta(16-22) were transformed into thin nanotubes when replaced with Chas, and thinner and twisted nanofibrils when replaced with Phgs. The red-shifting degree of characteristic CD peaks suggested an increased twisting in the self-assembly of the derivative peptides, especially in the case of Ac-KLV(Phg)(Phg)AE-NH2. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations also indicated the increasing trend in twisting when Chas or Phgs were substituted for Phes. These results demonstrated that the hydrophobic interactions and spatial conformation between Cha residues were sufficient to cause lateral association of beta-sheets to twisted/helical nanoribbons, which finally developed into nanotubes, while for Phg residue, the loss of the rotational freedom of the aromatic ring induced much stronger steric hindrance for the lateral stacking of Ac-KLV(Phg)(Phg)AE-NH2 beta-sheets, eventually leading to the nanofibril formation. This study thus demonstrates that both the aromatic structure and the steric conformation of Phe residues are crucial in Abeta(16-22) self-assembly, especially in the significant lateral association of beta-sheets.",

    "abstract": "Early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by synaptic dysfunction, a phenomenon in which soluble oligomers of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) are implicated. Here, we demonstrated that astrocytes express NMDARs and therefore have the potential to modulate the synaptotoxic actions of Abeta. We found that specific pharmacological antagonism of two of the major NMDAR subunits, GluN2A and GluN2B, exacerbates Abeta-induced synaptotoxicity suggesting, for the first time, that astrocytic GluN2A and GluN2B mediate synaptoprotection. From the perspective of the pathogenic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease, in which Abeta and NMDAR play significant roles, these observations are striking since neuronal GluN2A and GluN2B are well known modulators of neurodegeneration. We did initial studies to understand the basis for the differential effects of astrocytic and neuronal GluN2A and GluN2B in the promotion of synapse survival, and identified a neurotrophin produced by astrocytes, nerve growth factor beta (beta-NGF), as a likely mediator of the synaptoprotective effects of astrocytic GluN2A and GluN2B activation. The results presented suggest that astrocytes may be suitable druggable targets for the prevention and/or delay of the synaptic loss that occurs during early stages of AD.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal and synaptic loss are the best pathological correlates for memory decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Soluble beta-amyloid oligomers (AbetaO) are considered to putatively play a crucial role in the early synapse loss and cognitive impairment observed in AD. Evidence suggests that oxidative stress and apoptosis are involved in the mechanism of Abeta-induced neurotoxicity and AD pathogenesis. This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the early memory deficits induced by intracerebroventricular injection of AbetaO in mice. Ten days after a single AbetaO injection memory impairments were observed, as measured by Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests. Cognitive decline was associated with increased oxidative stress, caspase-9 activation, and decreased hippocampal synaptophysin immunoreactivity. Furthermore, GSH levels were significantly higher in AbetaO-injected mice than in sham mice, showing that a protective mechanism might develop due to oxidative stress. Additionally, AbetaO-induced toxicity was aligned with an increment of the activation of Akt and ERK1/2, and reduced activity of GSK3. These findings suggest that AbetaO injection triggers a cascade of events that mimic the key neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Abeta acute injection helps to better understand how this peptide impairs specific signaling pathways leading to synaptic and memory dysfunctions. Thus, this model is a valid tool for investigating AD and may suggest a new way to develop neuroprotective therapies at such early stages of the disease.",

    "title": "An early dysregulation of FAK and MEK/ERK signaling pathways precedes the beta-amyloid deposition in the olfactory bulb of APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Olfactory dysfunction is an early event of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms associated to AD neurodegeneration in olfactory areas are unknown. Here we used double-transgenic amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APPswe/PS1dE9) mice and label-free quantitative proteomics to analyze early pathological effects on the olfactory bulb (OB) during AD progression. Prior to beta-amyloid plaque formation, 9 modulated proteins were detected on 3-month-old APP/PS1 mice while 16 differential expressed proteins were detected at 6months, when beta-amyloid plaques appear, indicating a moderate imbalance in cytoskeletal rearrangement, and synaptic plasticity in APP/PS1 OBs. Moreover, beta-amyloid induced an inactivation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) together with a transient activation of MEK1/2, leading to inactivation of ERK1/2 in 6-months APP/PS1 OBs. In contrast, the analysis of human OBs revealed a late activation of FAK in advanced AD stages, whereas ERK1/2 activation was enhanced across AD staging respect to controls. This survival potential was accompanied by the inhibition of the proapototic factor BAD in the OB across AD phenotypes. Our data contribute to a better understanding of the early molecular mechanisms that are modulated in AD neurodegeneration, highlighting significant differences in the regulation of survival pathways between APP/PS1 mice and sporadic human AD. SIGNIFICANCE: Loss of smell is involved in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), usually preceding classic disease symptoms. However, the mechanisms governing this dysfunction are still poorly understood, losing its potential as a useful tool for clinical diagnosis. Our study characterizes potential AD-associated molecular changes in APP/PS1 mice olfactory bulb (OB) using MS-quantitative proteomics, revealing early cytoskeletal disruption and synaptic plasticity impairment. Moreover, an opposite pattern was found when comparing the activation status of specific survival pathways between APP/PS1 OBs and OBs derived from sAD subjects with different neuropathological grading. Our data reflect, in part, the progressive effect of APP overproduction and Abeta accumulation on the OB proteome during AD progression.",

    "abstract": "A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) deposits, which are associated with neuronal dysfunction, spine loss, and impaired Ca2+ homeostasis. Amyloid beta (Abeta) binds to and is aggregated by Zn2+ , a metal released from synaptic glutamatergic vesicles during neuronal activity. Synaptically released Zn2+ activates a metabotropic Gq-coupled Zn2+ -sensing receptor, mZnR/GPR39, and induces Ca2+ -signaling in post-synaptic neurons. We examined if Abeta, as a Zn2+ binding protein, regulates neuronal Zn2+ -signaling mediated by mZnR/GPR39 using SHSY-5Y cells and cortical neurons from GPR39 wild-type and knockout mice. Following acute or chronic treatment with Abeta neuronal Zn2+ -dependent Ca2+ release via mZnR/GPR39 is significantly reduced. This impairment is overcome when excess Zn2+ is applied, suggesting that impaired Ca2+ -signaling results from Abeta binding of Zn2+ . The Zn2+ -dependent mZnR/GPR39 activation triggers phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase and up-regulates expression of the chaperone protein clusterin (Clu). Importantly, neuronal Zn2+ -dependent extracellular regulated kinase1/2 phosphorylation and up-regulation of Clu are attenuated by silencing mZnR/GPR39 as well as by Abeta treatment. In contrast, Zn2+ -dependent AKT phosphorylation is not mediated by mZnR/GPR39 and is not attenuated by Abeta treatment. Thus, Zn2+ signaling via mZnR/GPR39 is distinctively disrupted by a critical pathological component of Alzheimer's disease. Synaptically released Zn2+ activates a Zn2+ -sensing receptor, mZnR/GPR39, and induces Ca2+ -signaling, followed by ERK1/2 MAPK activation and up-regulation of clusterin. Amyloid beta (Abeta) binds to Zn2+ thus forming oligomers that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. We show that Abeta attenuates Zn2+ -dependent Ca2+ -responses, abolishes ERK1/2 activation and down-regulates clusterin expression. Thus, Zn2+ signaling via mZnR/GPR39 is disrupted by Abeta, a critical pathological component of Alzheimer's disease.",

Establishing structure-activity relationships for these assemblies, which is critical for proper therapeutic target identification and design, requires aggregation and neurotoxicity experiments that are properly controlled with respect to the Abeta peptide itself. \"Reverse\" Abeta or non-Abeta peptides suffer from the fact that their biophysical properties are too similar or dissimilar, respectively, to those of native Abeta for them to be appropriate controls. For this reason, we used simple protein design principles to create scrambled Abeta peptides predicted to behave distinctly from native Abeta. We showed that our prediction was true by monitoring secondary structure dynamics with thioflavin T fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy, determining oligomer size distributions, and assaying neurotoxic activity. We then demonstrated the utility of the scrambled Abeta peptides by using them to control experiments examining the effects of Abeta monomers, dimers, higher-order oligomers, and fibrils on gene expression in primary rat hippocampal neurons. Significant changes in gene expression were observed for all peptide assemblies, but fibrils induced the largest changes. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed two predominant gene modules related to Abeta treatment. Many genes within these modules were associated with inflammatory signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "The E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is activated by the fizzy-related protein homolog/CDC20-like protein 1 (cdh1) in post-mitotic neurons. Growing evidence suggests that dysregulation of APC/C-Cdh1 is involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Here we show in neurons that oligomers of amyloid beta (Abeta), a peptide related to Alzheimer's disease, cause proteasome-dependent degradation of cdh1. This leads to a subsequent increase in glutaminase (a degradation target of APC/C-Cdh1), which causes an elevation of glutamate levels and further intraneuronal Ca(2+) dysregulation, resulting in neuronal apoptosis. Glutaminase inhibition prevents glutamate excitotoxicity and apoptosis in Abeta treated neurons. Furthermore, glutamate also decreases cdh1 and leads to accumulation of glutaminase, suggesting that there may be a positive feedback loop of cdh1 inactivation. We confirmed the main findings in vivo using microinjection of either Abeta or glutamate in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. We show here for the first time in vivo that both Abeta and glutamate cause nuclear exclusion of cdh1 and an increase in glutaminase. These results show that maintaining normal APC/C-Cdh1 activity may be a useful target in Alzheimer's disease treatment.",

    "abstract": "This commentary outlines a conceptual model for subjective cognitive decline (SCD) in relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers in the preclinical stages of disease and a framework for effectively utilizing SCD in secondary prevention clinical trials. Mounting evidence supports the notion that SCD is sensitive to encroaching Abeta-amyloid and neurodegeneration. SCD has also been shown to provide additive information of AD-dementia risk beyond what is known about the biomarker status of the individual. Thus, we provide recommendations for the implementing SCD measurement in clinical trials. We argue that SCD can be measured at three catch points within the course of the clinical trial: firstly, at the initial recruitment and screening phase; secondly, to create more robust estimates of rates of AD-dementia progression; and finally, to measure subjective experiences of cognitive change and quality of life over the course of the trial as a proxy of clinically meaningful functional improvement. We provide recommendations of how SCD can be approached at each of these points. SCD is an important component of the preclinical AD-dementia trajectory. Future studies need to elucidate the interactive influence of Abeta-amyloid and tau on SCD from a spatiotemporal perspective. Even as this evidence accrues, it is clear that SCD can provide unique and additive information about rates of progression and subjectively experienced cognitive change within clinical trials.",

To identify novel regulators of mitochondrial dynamics, we screened a phytochemical library and identified liquiritigenin as a potent inducer of mitochondrial fusion. Treatment with liquiritigenin induced an elongated mitochondrial morphology in SK-N-MC cells. In addition, liquiritigenin rescued mitochondrial fragmentation induced by knockout of mitochondrial fusion mediators such as Mfn1, Mfn2, and Opa1.

APOE4 increases and APOE2 decreases the risk for Alzheimer disease (AD) compared to the risk associated with APOE3 Because apoE4 is less efficient at cholesterol efflux than apoE2 or apoE3 in vitro, we hypothesized that APOE genotype may affect apoE particle size in vivo and that these size differences may be related to AD risk. We used nondenaturing gel electrophoresis to test for differences in the size of apoE complexes in human CSF samples of various APOE genotypes and created profiles of each sample to compare the patterns of apoE distribution. For middle-aged adults with no dementia, APOE 2.3 individuals had significantly larger apoE complexes than APOE 3.3 subjects, who had significantly larger apoE complexes than APOE 3.4 and APOE 4.4 individuals. Similarly, in an independent cohort of older adults, CSF apoE complexes of APOE4-positive individuals were smaller than those of the APOE4-negative individuals. Compared to individuals with no dementia, those with the mildest stages of dementia had similar sized CSF apoE complexes. These results identify a novel phenotypic difference in the size of CSF apoE complexes in middle age that correlate with the risk of AD later in life.",

    "abstract": "The pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include extracellular neuritic plaques containing beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide, a cleaved fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP) via beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is increasingly thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD, both as a regulator of the production of Abeta and through its well-established role as a tau kinase. Fuzhisan (FZS), a Chinese herbal complex prescription, has been used for the treatment AD for over 20 years, and is known to enhance the cognitive ability in AD patients as well as in AD model rats. To investigate mechanisms of AD and the potential therapy of FZS in AD, we treated senescence-accelerated mouse SAMP8 mice, a useful model of AD-related memory impairment, with FZS by intragastrical administration for 8 weeks and Donepizel was used as a positive control. The results showed that FZS (0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 g/kg/day) improved impaired cognitive ability of aged SAMP8 mice in a dose-dependent manner. FZS robustly decreased Abeta level and phosphorylation of tau. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the BACE1 level and phosphorylated APP (Thr668). Futhermore, The p25/Cdk5 pathway was markedly down-regulated by FZS treatment. These results indicated that the memory ameliorating effect of FZS may be, in part, by regulation the p25/Cdk5 pathway which may contribute to down-regulation of Abeta and tau hyperphosphorylation.",

Between the two possible dimerization motifs proposed by NMR and EPR, namely G709XXXA713 and G700XXXG704XXXG708, our study revealed that the dimer promoted by the G709XXXA713 motif is not stable in the SPM due to the competition with highly unsaturated lipids that constitute the SPM. Under the same conditions, the dimer promoted by the G700XXXG704XXXG708 motif is instead the most stable species and likely the most biologically relevant. Independently of the dimerization state, both these motifs can be involved in the recruitment of cholesterol molecules.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of our study was to investigate the protective effects of a natural product-'curcumin'- in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neurons. Although much research has been done in AD, very little has been reported on the effects of curcumin on mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics, function and synaptic activities. Therefore, the present study investigated the protective effects against amyloid beta (Abeta) induced mitochondrial and synaptic toxicities. Using human neuroblastoma (SHSY5Y) cells, curcumin and Abeta, we studied the protective effects of curcumin against Abeta. Further, we also studied preventive (curcumin+Abeta) and intervention (Abeta+curcumin) effects of curcumin against Abeta in SHSY5Y cells. Using real time RT-PCR, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis, we measured mRNA and protein levels of mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial biogenesis and synaptic genes. We also assessed mitochondrial function by measuring hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxidation, cytochrome oxidase activity and mitochondrial ATP. Cell viability was studied using the MTT assay. Abeta was found to impair mitochondrial dynamics, reduce mitochondrial biogenesis and decrease synaptic activity and mitochondrial function. In contrast, curcumin enhanced mitochondrial fusion activity and reduced fission machinery, and increased biogenesis and synaptic proteins. Mitochondrial function and cell viability were elevated in curcumin treated cells. Interestingly, curcumin pre- and post-treated cells incubated with Abeta showed reduced mitochondrial dysfunction, and maintained cell viability and mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial biogenesis and synaptic activity. Further, the protective effects of curcumin were stronger in pretreated SHSY5Y cells than in post-treated cells, indicating that curcumin works better in prevention than treatment in AD-like neurons. Our findings suggest that curcumin is a promising drug molecule to treat AD patients.",

METHODS: White-matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and infarcts on MRI were assessed in consecutive DLB (n = 81) and AD dementia (n = 240) patients and compared to age-matched and sex-matched cognitively normal subjects (CN) from a population-based cohort. RESULTS: DLB had higher WMH volume compared to CN, and WMH volume was higher in the occipital and posterior periventricular regions in DLB compared to AD. Higher WMH volume was associated with history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes but not with clinical disease severity in DLB. Frequency of infarcts in DLB was not different from CN and AD dementia. DISCUSSION: In DLB, WMH volume is higher than AD and CN and appears to be primarily associated with history of vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Glucose hypometabolism is a prominent feature of the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Disease progression is associated with a reduction in glucose transporters in both neurons and endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier. However, whether increasing glucose transport into either of these cell types offers therapeutic potential remains unknown. Using an adult-onset Drosophila model of Abeta (amyloid beta) toxicity, we show that genetic overexpression of a glucose transporter, specifically in neurons, rescues lifespan, behavioral phenotypes, and neuronal morphology. This amelioration of Abeta toxicity is associated with a reduction in the protein levels of the unfolded protein response (UPR) negative master regulator Grp78 and an increase in the UPR. We further demonstrate that genetic downregulation of Grp78 activity also protects against Abeta toxicity, confirming a causal effect of its alteration on AD-related pathology. Metformin, a drug that stimulates glucose uptake in cells, mimicked these effects, with a concomitant reduction in Grp78 levels and rescue of the shortened lifespan and climbing defects of Abeta-expressing flies. Our findings demonstrate a protective effect of increased neuronal uptake of glucose against Abeta toxicity and highlight Grp78 as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.",

Therefore, we investigated the possible effects of betaAP1-42 on isolated rat heart and ileum. The hearts were perfused with modified Krebs-Henseleit solution. Left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), maximal rate of pressure development of left ventricle (+dP/dtmax), heart rate, coronary flow, monophasic action potential amplitude (MAPamp), MAP duration at 90% repolarization (MAP90) and contractions of ileum were measured. One, 10 and 100 nmol/l doses of betaAP1-42 significantly decreased LVDP, +dP/dtmax and heart rate. The dose of 1 nmol/l did not change coronary flow, but 10 and 100 nmol/l doses significantly reduced it. All doses of betaAP1-42 did not alter MAPamp, but increased MAP90. betaAP1-42 (1, 10, 100, 1,000 nmol/l) also did not influence ileum contractions. We suggest that betaAP1-42 produces negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects with an increase in MAP duration. Furthermore, betaAP1-42 at high doses decreases coronary flow.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent of a large group of related proteinopathies for which there is currently no cure. Here, we used Drosophila to explore a strategy to block Abeta42 neurotoxicity through engineering of the Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), a chaperone that has demonstrated neuroprotective activity against several intracellular amyloids. To target its protective activity against extracellular Abeta42, we added a signal peptide to Hsp70. This secreted form of Hsp70 (secHsp70) suppresses Abeta42 neurotoxicity in adult eyes, reduces cell death, protects the structural integrity of adult neurons, alleviates locomotor dysfunction, and extends lifespan. SecHsp70 binding to Abeta42 through its holdase domain is neuroprotective, but its ATPase activity is not required in the extracellular space. Thus, the holdase activity of secHsp70 masks Abeta42 neurotoxicity by promoting the accumulation of nontoxic aggregates. Combined with other approaches, this strategy may contribute to reduce the burden of AD and other extracellular proteinopathies.",

    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease, aggregates of Abeta and tau in amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles spread progressively across brain tissues following a characteristic pattern, implying a tissue-specific vulnerability to the disease. We report a transcriptional analysis of healthy brains and identify an expression signature that predicts-at ages well before the typical onset-the tissue-specific progression of the disease. We obtain this result by finding a quantitative correlation between the histopathological staging of the disease and the expression patterns of the proteins that coaggregate in amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, together with those of the protein homeostasis components that regulate Abeta and tau. Because this expression signature is evident in healthy brains, our analysis provides an explanatory link between a tissue-specific environmental risk of protein aggregation and a corresponding vulnerability to Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Importance: Higher dietary intake of the essential fatty acid docosahexaenoic (DHA) has been associated with better cognitive performance in several epidemiological studies. Animal and in vitro studies also indicate that DHA prevents amyloid deposition in the brain. Objective: To determine the association between serum DHA levels, cerebral amyloidosis, and the volumes of brain areas affected by Alzheimer disease. Design, Settings, and Participants: Cross-sectional analysis of serum DHA levels together with measures of amyloid deposition (Pittsburgh Compound B index), brain volumes, and neuropsychological testing scores from 61 participants in the Aging Brain Study. The study was conducted between June 2008 and May 2013, and the data were analyzed between October 2015 and April 2016. Linear models were adjusted for age, sex, years of education, and apolipoprotein E status. Main Outcomes and Measures: Serum DHA levels with cerebral amyloidosis measured using PIB PET. Results: Samples were available from 61 Aging Brain Study participants (41 women and 20 men) who underwent amyloid PET imaging. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 77 (6) years and ranged from 67 to 88 years. Serum DHA levels (percentage of total fatty acids) were 23% lower in participants with cerebral amyloidosis than those without (0.97 vs 1.25, P = .007) and were inversely correlated with brain amyloid load (r = -0.32, P = .01) independent of age, sex, apolipoprotein E genotype, and years of education. Moreover, greater serum DHA levels were positively associated with brain volume in several subregions affected by AD, in particular the left subiculum (r = 0.38, P = .005) and the left entorhinal volumes (r = 0.51, P = .001). Serum DHA levels were also associated with nonverbal memory scores (r = 0.28, P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, serum DHA levels were associated with pathogenesis of cerebral amyloidosis and with preservation of entorhinal and hippocampal volumes. These findings suggest an important role for DHA metabolism in brain amyloid deposition during the preclinical or early symptomatic stages of Alzheimer disease.",

    "abstract": "A central molecular hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the beta- and gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which causes the generation of different c-terminal fragments like C99, AICD57, or AICD50 that fully or in part contain the APP transmembrane domain. In this study, we demonstrate that membrane-tethered C99 is phosphorylated by JNK3A at residue T668 (APP695 numbering) to a higher extent than AICD57, whereas AICD50 is not capable of being phosphorylated. The modification decreases the turnover of APP, while the blockade of APP cleavage increases APP phosphorylation. Generation of nuclear spheres, complexes consisting of the translocated AICD, FE65 and other proteins, is significantly reduced as soon as APP c-terminal fragments are accessible for phosphorylation. This APP modification, which we identified as significantly reduced in high plaque-load areas of the human brain, is linearly dependent on the level of APP expression. Accordingly, we show that APP abundance is likewise capable of modulating nuclear sphere generation. Thus, the precise and complex regulation of APP phosphorylation, abundance, and cleavage impacts the generation of nuclear spheres, which are under discussion of being of relevance in neurodegeneration and dementia. Future pharmacological manipulation of nuclear sphere generation may be a promising approach for AD treatment.",

METHODS: We generated the blood-based signature for 585 healthy controls (HCs) and 74 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study who underwent clinical reclassification (blinded to biomarker findings) at 54-month follow-up. The individuals were split into estimated high and low NAB groups based on a cutoff of 1.5 standardized uptake value ratio. We assessed the predictive accuracy of the high and low NAB groupings based on progression to mild cognitive impairment or AD according to clinical reclassification at 54-month follow-up. RESULTS: Twelve percent of HCs with estimated high NAB progressed in comparison to 5% of HCs with estimated low NAB (odds ratio = 2.4). Forty percent of the participants with MCI who had estimated high NAB progressed in comparison to 5% of the participants with MCI who had estimated low NAB (odds ratio = 12.3). These ratios are in line with those reported for Pittsburgh compound B-PET results. Individuals with estimated high NAB had faster rates of memory decline than those with estimated low NAB. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that a simple blood-based signature not only provides estimates of NAB but also predicts cognitive decline and disease progression, identifying individuals at risk of progressing toward AD at the prodromal and preclinical stages.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Recent evidence implicates exosomes in the aggregation of Abeta and spreading of tau in Alzheimer's disease. In neural cells, exosome formation can be blocked by inhibition or silencing of neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (nSMase2). We generated genetically nSMase2-deficient 5XFAD mice (fro;5XFAD) to assess AD-related pathology in a mouse model with consistently reduced ceramide generation. We conducted in vitro assays to assess Abeta42 aggregation and glial clearance with and without exosomes isolated by ultracentrifugation and determined exosome-induced amyloid aggregation by particle counting. We analyzed brain exosome content, amyloid plaque formation, neuronal degeneration, sphingolipid, Abeta42 and phospho-tau levels, and memory-related behaviors in 5XFAD versus fro;5XFAD mice using contextual and cued fear conditioning. Astrocyte-derived exosomes accelerated aggregation of Abeta42 and blocked glial clearance of Abeta42 in vitro Abeta42 aggregates were colocalized with extracellular ceramide in vitro using a bifunctional ceramide analog preloaded into exosomes and in vivo using anticeramide IgG, implicating ceramide-enriched exosomes in plaque formation. Compared with 5XFAD mice, the fro;5XFAD mice had reduced brain exosomes, ceramide levels, serum anticeramide IgG, glial activation, total Abeta42 and plaque burden, tau phosphorylation, and improved cognition in a fear-conditioned learning task. Ceramide-enriched exosomes appear to exacerbate AD-related brain pathology by promoting the aggregation of Abeta. Reduction of exosome secretion by nSMase2 loss of function improves pathology and cognition in the 5XFAD mouse model. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We present for the first time evidence, using Alzheimer's disease (AD) model mice deficient in neural exosome secretion due to lack of neutral sphingomyelinase-2 function, that ceramide-enriched exosomes exacerbate AD-related pathologies and cognitive deficits. Our results provide rationale to pursue a means of inhibiting exosome secretion as a potential therapy for individuals at risk for developing AD.",

    "title": "Manduca Contactin Regulates Amyloid Precursor Protein-Dependent Neuronal Migration.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Amyloid precursor protein (APP) was originally identified as the source of beta-amyloid peptides that accumulate in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it also has been implicated in the control of multiple aspects of neuronal motility. APP belongs to an evolutionarily conserved family of transmembrane proteins that can interact with a variety of adapter and signaling molecules. Recently, we showed that both APP and its insect ortholog [APPL (APP-Like)] directly bind the heterotrimeric G-protein Goalpha, supporting the model that APP can function as an unconventional Goalpha-coupled receptor. We also adapted a well characterized assay of neuronal migration in the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, to show that APPL-Goalpha signaling restricts ectopic growth within the developing nervous system, analogous to the role postulated for APP family proteins in controlling migration within the mammalian cortex. Using this assay, we have now identified Manduca Contactin (MsContactin) as an endogenous ligand for APPL, consistent with previous work showing that Contactins interact with APP family proteins in other systems. Using antisense-based knockdown protocols and fusion proteins targeting both proteins, we have shown that MsContactin is selectively expressed by glial cells that ensheath the migratory neurons (expressing APPL), and that MsContactin-APPL interactions normally prevent inappropriate migration and outgrowth. These results provide new evidence that Contactins can function as authentic ligands for APP family proteins that regulate APP-dependent responses in the developing nervous system. They also support the model that misregulated Contactin-APP interactions might provoke aberrant activation of Goalpha and its effectors, thereby contributing to the neurodegenerative sequelae that typify AD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Members of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) family participate in many aspects of neuronal development, but the ligands that normally activate APP signaling have remained controversial. This research provides new evidence that members of the Contactin family function as authentic ligands for APP and its orthologs, and that this evolutionarily conserved class of membrane-attached proteins regulates key aspects of APP-dependent migration and outgrowth in the embryonic nervous system. By defining the normal role of Contactin-APP signaling during development, these studies also provide the framework for investigating how the misregulation of Contactin-APP interactions might contribute to neuronal dysfunction in the context of both normal aging and neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) can cause neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It evokes a cascade of oxidative damage to neurons. Pinocembrin (PCB), the most abundant flavonoid in propolis, has been proven to have neuroprotective effects in vivo and in vitro. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of PCB on Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to 25muM Abeta25-35 for 24h caused viability loss, apoptotic increase and reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase, pre-treatment with PCB for 4h significantly reduced the viability loss, apoptotic rate and attenuated Abeta-mediated ROS production. PCB strikingly inhibited Abeta25-35-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions, including lowered membrane potential, decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio. In addition, PCB suppressed the release of cytochrome c and the cleavage of caspase-3. PCB treatment also resulted in an increase in Nrf2 protein levels and subsequent induction of heme oxygenase-1(HO-1) expression in SH-SY5Y cells. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Nrf2 expression suppressed the PCB-induced HO-1 expression. Notably, we found that the HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) markedly diminished the neuroprotective effect of PCB against Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity. Taken together, these results indicated that PCB protects SH-SY5Y cells from Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity through activation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathways. Thus, activation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathways and inhibition of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis together may protect cells from Abeta25-35-induceded neurotoxicity.",

    "title": "Prevalence of Amyloid Positron Emission Tomographic Positivity in Poststroke Mild Cognitive Impairment.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is common after stroke and associated with poor outcome. However, the mechanisms underlying poststroke MCI (PS-MCI) are insufficiently understood. We performed amyloid-beta positron emission tomography (PET) in a prospective cohort of stroke survivors to determine the role of amyloid pathology in PS-MCI. METHODS: We studied 178 consecutive patients enrolled into the prospective DEDEMAS study (Determinants of Dementia After Stroke). Follow-up visits 6 months post stroke included detailed cognitive testing, standardized magnetic resonance imaging, and amyloid-beta imaging using flutemetamol ((18)F) PET. MCI was defined by the modified Petersen criteria. Amyloid-positivity was assessed visually and quantitatively. Fifty-six (31%) patients agreed to undergo PET imaging. RESULTS: Thirty-eight (68%) patients who consented to PET imaging had PS-MCI. Visual assessment revealed amyloid PET positivity in 2 (5%) of the 38 PS-MCI patients and in 2 (11%) of the 18 cognitively healthy stroke survivors. There was no correlation between flutemetamol ((18)F) standardized uptake value ratios and cognitive scores in the 56 patients. PS-MCI patients had significant cognitive impairments on executive function (P<0.01) and memory tests (P<0.01) when compared with cognitively healthy stroke survivors (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of amyloid-pathology in patients with PS-MCI is not increased when compared with cognitively healthy stroke survivors and to recent estimates for cognitively healthy elderly subjects. Factors other than amyloid-pathology likely contribute to the development of PS-MCI. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01334749.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and frontotemporal lobar dementia are among the most pressing problems of developed societies with aging populations. Neurons carry out essential functions such as signal transmission and network integration in the central nervous system and are the main targets of neurodegenerative disease. In this Review, I address how the neuron's environment also contributes to neurodegeneration. Maintaining an optimal milieu for neuronal function rests with supportive cells termed glia and the blood-brain barrier. Accumulating evidence suggests that neurodegeneration occurs in part because the environment is affected during disease in a cascade of processes collectively termed neuroinflammation. These observations indicate that therapies targeting glial cells might provide benefit for those afflicted by neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Due to the impermeability of the blood-brain barrier and the nonselective distribution of drugs in the brain, the therapeutic access to intractable neurological disorders is challenging. In this study, dual brain-targeting polymersomes (POs) functionalized by transferrin and Tet-1 peptide (Tf/Tet-1-POs) promoted the transportation of curcumin into the brain and provided neuroprotection. The modification of the ligands that bind to the surface of POs was revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The cell uptake of a coculture model of mouse brain capillary endothelial cells with neurons showed that the Tf/Tet-1-POs had significant transportation properties and possessed affinity for neurons. The pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the blood-brain barrier permeability-surface efficiency of the Tf/Tet-1-POs was 0.28 mL/h/g and that the brain tissue uptake rate (% ID/g) was 0.08, which were significant compared with the controls (P<0.05). The curcumin-encapsulated Tf/Tet-1-POs provided neuroprotection and ameliorated cognitive dysfunction in intrahippocampal amyloid-beta1-42-injected mice. These results suggest that the dual brain-targeting POs are more capable of drug delivery to the brain that can be exploited as a multiple noninvasive vehicle for targeting therapeutics.",

Rodent models of the disease show that further increase in Abeta42 production and earlier brain pathology can be obtained by coexpressing AbetaPP and PSEN1 mutations. To generate such elevated Abeta42 level in a large animal model, we produced Gottingen minipigs carrying in their genome one copy of a human PSEN1 cDNA with the Met146Ile (PSEN1M146I) mutation and three copies of a human AbetaPP695 cDNA with the Lys670Asn/Met671Leu (AbetaPPsw) double-mutation. Both transgenes were expressed in fibroblasts and in the brain, and their respective proteins were processed normally. Immunohistochemical staining with Abeta42-specific antibodies detected intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta42 in brains from a 10- and an 18-month-old pig. Such accumulation may represent an early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "The presence of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related neuropathology among cognitively normal individuals has been well documented. It has been proposed that these individuals may represent a pre-clinical AD population. Previous studies have demonstrated a negative association between the presence of both amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles with ante-mortem cognitive performance, a relationship which is likely influenced by a number of factors including age and APOE e4 carrier status. The present study determined whether the presence of neuritic plaques (NPs) and diffuse plaques (DPs) are associated with performance in a number of cognitive domains after accounting for APOE e4 carrier status and neurofibrillary tangle presence in a cohort of 123 older participants from the Rush Religious Order Study who died with a premortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI). After adjusting for age at death, education, gender, Braak stage, and APOE e4 carrier status, the presence of NPs was associated with lower performance in the cognitive domains of Global Cognition (p = 0.002), Episodic Memory (p = 0.03), Semantic Memory (p = 0.009), and Visuospatial performance (p = 0.006), while DPs showed no association with any cognitive domain examined. These results suggest that decreases in cognition in elderly NCI individuals are associated with an increase in NPs and not DPs when age at death, education, gender, APOE e4 status, and Braak stage are taken into consideration.",

Meanwhile, miR-98-5p dysregulation was found in AD. However, whether miR-98-5p is involved in the accumulation of Abeta in AD, the underlying molecule mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we confirmed that miR-98-5p negatively regulated sorting nexin 6 (SNX6) expression by targeting the 3'-UTR of SNX6 mRNA. Downregulation of miR-98-5p alleviated Abeta-induced viability inhibition and decreased apoptosis in SK-N-SH and SH-SY5Y cells by upregulating SNX6 expression. Furthermore, downregulation of miR-98-5p decreased SNX6-dependent levels of Abeta40, Abeta42, beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), soluble amyloid precursor protein beta (sAPPbeta), and membrane-associated APP beta-carboxyl terminal fragment (betaCTF) in SK-N-SH and HEK293 cells. Our findings demonstrate that miR-98-5p modulates SNX6 expression and thus plays a critical role in accumulation of Abeta. Therefore, miR-98-5p may be a novel therapeutic target for AD.",

We describe here an approach to the analysis of the Abeta aggregation mechanism that uses Abeta-polyglutamine hybrid peptides designed to retard amyloid maturation and an adjusted thioflavin intensity scale that reveals structural features of aggregation intermediates. The results support an aggregation initiation mechanism for Abeta-polyQ hybrids, and by extension for full-length Abeta peptides, in which a modular Abeta C-terminal segment mediates rapid, non-nucleated formation of alpha-helical oligomers. The resulting high local concentration of tethered amyloidogenic segments within these alpha-oligomers facilitates transition to a beta-oligomer population that, via further remodelling and/or elongation steps, ultimately generates mature amyloid. Consistent with this mechanism, an engineered Abeta C-terminal fragment delays aggregation onset by Abeta-polyglutamine peptides and redirects assembly of Abeta42 fibrils.",

The results showed that both LMW and HMW FGF2 attenuated the amyloid beta toxicity in the primary cultured hippocampal neurons as measured by WST and LDH release assay. Moreover, the analysis suggested that HMW FGF2 had stronger neuroprotective effect than LMW FGF2. We then demonstrated that LMW and HMW FGF2 activated the ERK and AKT signaling pathways in a similar way. Furthermore, using the ERK inhibitor and AKT inhibitor, we found that the AKT signaling but not ERK signaling pathway was required for the neuroprotective effects of FGF2.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, progressive neurological disorder characterized by the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques composed of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta), the key component in pathogenesis of AD. Peripheral administration of enoxaparin (ENO) reportedly reduces the level of Abeta and the amyloid plaques in the cortex of amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. However, the exact mechanism of these effects is unclear. Our previous studies indicated that ENO can inhibit APP processing to Abeta in primary cortical cells from Tg2576 mice by downregulating BACE1 levels. This study examines whether ENO-induced reduction of amyloid load is due to the decreased APP processing to Abeta in Tg2576 mice. Surprisingly, our results indicated that ENO significantly increases the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio in cortex and enhances the amyloid plaque load in both cortex and hippocampus, although overall APP processing was not influenced by ENO. Moreover, ENO stimulated the aggregation of both Abeta40 and Abeta42 in vitro. Although ENO has been reported to improve cognition in vivo and has potential as a therapeutic agent for AD, the results from our study suggest that ENO can exacerbate the amyloid pathology, and the strategy of using ENO for the treatment of AD may require further assessment.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Continuous levels of PiB and ND, tau levels in the medial and inferior temporal lobes, and longitudinal cognition were examined. Data collection began in 2010 and is ongoing. Data were analyzed from 2015 to 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: Evidence of amyloid-independent tau deposition and/or cognitive decline. Results: Of the 247 participants (142 women [57.5%]; 105 men [42.5%]; mean age, 74 [range, 63-90] years), 64 (25.9%) were classified as having SNAP. Compared with the stage 0 group, the SNAP group was not more likely to have subthreshold PiB values (higher values within the Abeta- range), suggesting that misclassification due to the PiB cutoff was not a prominent contributor to this group (mean [SD] distribution volume ratio, 1.08 [0.05] for the SNAP group; 1.09 [0.05] for the stage 1 group). Tau levels in the medial and inferior temporal lobes were indistinguishable between the SNAP and stage 0 groups (entorhinal cortex, beta = -0.005 [SE, 0.036]; parahippocampal gyrus, beta = -0.001 [SE, 0.027]; and inferior temporal lobe, beta = -0.004 [SE, 0.027]; P >= .88) and were lower in the SNAP group compared with the stage 2 group (entorhinal cortex, beta = -0.125 [SE, 0.041]; parahippocampal gyrus, beta = -0.074 [SE, 0.030]; and inferior temporal lobe, beta = -0.083 [SE, 0.031]; P <= .02). The stage 2 group demonstrated greater cognitive decline compared with all other groups (stage 0, beta = -0.239 [SE, 0.042]; stage 1, beta = -0.242 [SE, 0.051]; and SNAP, beta = -0.157 [SE, 0.044]; P <= .001), whereas the SNAP group showed a diminished practice effect over time compared with the stage 0 group (beta = -0.082 [SE, 0.037]; P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, clinically normal adults with SNAP did not exhibit evidence of elevated tau levels, which suggests that this biomarker construct does not represent amyloid-independent tauopathy. At the group level, individuals with SNAP did not show cognitive decline but did show a diminished practice effect. SNAP is likely heterogeneous, with a subset of this group at elevated risk for short-term decline. Future refinement of biomarkers will be necessary to subclassify this group and determine the biological correlates of ND markers among Abeta- CN individuals.",

Moreover, compound 5r displayed appropriate blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability both in vitro and in vivo and could improve memory and cognitive function of scopolamine-induced amnesia mice.

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced oxidative stress and toxicity are leading risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Monascin (MS) is a novel compound proposed for antioxidative stress applications and is derived from an edible fungus secondary metabolite. This study assessed the effects of MS on oxidative stress, paralysis, Abeta accumulation, and lifespan in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and investigated its underlying mechanisms of action. The results showed that MS increased the survival of C. elegans under juglone-induced oxidative stress and attenuated endogenous levels of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, MS induced a decline in Abeta-induced paralysis phenotype and Abeta deposits in the transgenic strains CL4176 and CL2006 of C. elegans, which expresses human muscle-specific Abeta1-42 in the cytoplasm of body wall muscle cells. In addition, mRNA levels of strain CL4176 of several antioxidant genes (sod-1, sod-2, sod-3, hsp16.2) and daf-16 were up-regulated by MS treatment when compared to the nontreated controls. Further evidence showed that MS treatment in C. elegans strains lacking DAF-16/FOXO did not affect paralysis or lifespan phenotypes. The findings indicate that MS reduces oxidative stress and Abeta toxicity via DAF-16 in C. elegans, suggesting that MS can be used for the prevention of AD-associated oxidative stress complications.",

    "abstract": "Cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by gamma-secretase is a crucial first step in the evolution of Alzheimer's disease. To discover the cleavage mechanism, it is urgent to predict the structures of APP monomers and dimers in varying membrane environments. We determined the structures of the C9923-55 monomer and homodimer as a function of membrane lipid composition using a multiscale simulation approach that blends atomistic and coarse-grained models. We demonstrate that the C9923-55 homodimer structures form a heterogeneous ensemble with multiple conformational states, each stabilized by characteristic interpeptide interactions. The relative probabilities of each conformational state are sensitive to the membrane environment, leading to substantial variation in homodimer peptide structure as a function of membrane lipid composition or the presence of an anionic lipid environment. In contrast, the helicity of the transmembrane domain of monomeric C991-55 is relatively insensitive to the membrane lipid composition, in agreement with experimental observations. The dimer structures of human EphA2 receptor depend on the lipid environment, which we show is linked to the location of the structural motifs in the dimer interface, thereby establishing that both sequence and membrane composition modulate the complete energy landscape of membrane-bound proteins. As a by-product of our work, we explain the discrepancy in structures predicted for C99 congener homodimers in membrane and micelle environments. Our study provides insight into the observed dependence of C99 protein cleavage by gamma-secretase, critical to the formation of amyloid-beta protein, on membrane thickness and lipid composition.",

    "title": "Novel allele-dependent role for APOE in controlling the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes.",
    "abstract": "The strongest genetic risk factor influencing susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. APOE has three common isoforms in humans, E2, E3, and E4. The presence of two copies of the E4 allele increases risk by ~12-fold whereas E2 allele is associated with an ~twofold decreased risk for AD. These data put APOE central to AD pathophysiology, but it is not yet clear how APOE alleles modify AD risk. Recently we found that astrocytes, a major central nervous system cell type that produces APOE, are highly phagocytic and participate in normal synapse pruning and turnover. Here, we report a novel role for APOE in controlling the phagocytic capacity of astrocytes that is highly dependent on APOE isoform. APOE2 enhances the rate of phagocytosis of synapses by astrocytes, whereas APO4 decreases it. We also found that the amount of C1q protein accumulation in hippocampus, which may represent the accumulation of senescent synapses with enhanced vulnerability to complement-mediated degeneration, is highly dependent on APOE alleles: C1q accumulation was significantly reduced in APOE2 knock-in (KI) animals and was significantly increased in APOE4 KI animals compared with APOE3 KI animals. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of C1q-coated senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) are the primary conduits of excitatory synaptic transmission. AMPARs are predominantly Ca2+-impermeable in the matured excitatory synapse, except under certain circumstances. Growing evidence implicates the Ca2+ permeability of AMPARs in the regulation of long-term synaptic plasticity and in the pathophysiology of several neurological disorders. Therefore, the Ca2+ conductance of AMPARs may have both physiological and pathological roles at synapses. However, our understanding of the role of Ca2+ permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) in Alzheimer's disease is limited. Here we discuss insights into the potential CP-AMPAR mediated pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, including: 1. Ca2+-mediated aberrant regulation of synapse weakening mechanisms, and 2. neuronal network dysfunction in the brain. Consideration of CP-AMPARs as primary drivers of pathophysiology could help in understanding synaptopathologies, and highlights the potential of CP-AMPARs as therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neuropathologically characterized by neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Progression of both plaques and tangles throughout the brain follows a hierarchical distribution which is defined by intrinsic cytoarchitectonic features and extrinsic connectivity patterns. What has less well been studied is how cortical convolutions influence the distribution of AD pathology. Here, the distribution of both plaques and tangles within subsulcal gyral components (fundi) to components forming their top regions at the subarachnoidal brain surface (crowns) by stereological methods in seven different cortical areas was systematically compared. Further, principle differences in cytoarchitectonic organization of cortical crowns and fundi that might provide the background for regionally selective vulnerability were attempted to identify. It was shown that both plaques and tangles were more prominent in sulcal fundi than gyri crowns. The differential distribution of pathology along convolutions corresponds to subgyral differences in the vascular network, GFAP-positive astrocytes and intracortical and subcortical connectivity. While the precise mechanisms accounting for these differences remain open, the presence of systematic inhomogeneities in the distribution of AD pathology along cortical convolutions indicates that the phylogenetic shaping of the cortex is associated with features that render the human brain vulnerable to AD pathology.",

Two derivatives (5d and 5k) displayed significant binding abilities in fluorescent staining experiments using the brain sections of AD patients. Two derivatives showed high binding affinities to beta-amyloid aggregates (5j, Ki = 5.82 +- 0.19 nM) and brain homogenates of AD patients (5j, Ki = 18.96 +- 0.28 nM) in in vitro binding assay. With a log P value of 3.45, [125I]5k exhibited an excellent initial brain uptake (5.29%ID g-1, 2 min after i.v.) and a fast clearance from the brain in biodistribution experiments in normal mice. In autoradiography, [125I]5k exhibited an obvious binding ability to beta-amyloid plaques and a relatively low nonspecific binding in the brain sections of AD patients (in vitro) and APP/PS1 transgenic mice (in vitro and ex vivo).

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is characterized by lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol. Interestingly, NPC patients' brains also show increased levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, a key protein in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. We previously reported that the c-Abl tyrosine kinase is active in NPC neurons and in AD animal models and that Imatinib, a specific c-Abl inhibitor, decreased the amyloid burden in brains of the AD mouse model. Active c-Abl was shown to interact with the APP cytosolic domain, but the relevance of this interaction to APP processing has yet to be defined. RESULTS: In this work we show that c-Abl inhibition reduces APP amyloidogenic cleavage in NPC cells overexpressing APP. Indeed, we found that levels of the Abeta oligomers and the carboxy-terminal fragment betaCTF were decreased when the cells were treated with Imatinib and upon shRNA-mediated c-Abl knockdown. Moreover, Imatinib decreased APP amyloidogenic processing in the brain of an NPC mouse model. In addition, we found decreased levels of betaCTF in neuronal cultures from c-Abl null mice. We demonstrate that c-Abl directly interacts with APP, that c-Abl inhibition prevents this interaction, and that Tyr682 in the APP cytoplasmic tail is essential for this interaction. More importantly, we found that c-Abl inhibition by Imatinib significantly inhibits the interaction between APP and BACE1. CONCLUSION: We conclude that c-Abl activity facilitates the APP-BACE1 interaction, thereby promoting amyloidogenic processing of APP. Thus, inhibition of c-Abl could be a pharmacological target for preventing the injurious effects of increased Abeta levels in NPC disease.",

    "abstract": "One of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the presence of amyloid plaques, which are deposits of misfolded and aggregated amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). The role of the c-Abl tyrosine kinase in Abeta-mediated neurodegeneration has been previously reported. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of inhibiting c-Abl using imatinib. We developed a novel method, based on a technique used to detect prions (PMCA), to measure minute amounts of misfolded-Abeta in the blood of AD transgenic mice. We found that imatinib reduces Abeta-oligomers in plasma, which correlates with a reduction of AD brain features such as plaques and oligomers accumulation, neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits. Cells exposed to imatinib and c-Abl KO mice display decreased levels of beta-CTF fragments, suggesting that an altered processing of the amyloid-beta protein precursor is the most probable mechanism behind imatinib effects. Our findings support the role of c-Abl in Abeta accumulation and AD, and propose AD-PMCA as a new tool to evaluate AD progression and screening for drug candidates.",

    "abstract": "Microglia are immune cells of the brain that display a range of functions. Most of our knowledge about microglia biology and function is based on cells from the rodent brain. Species variation in the complexity of the brain and differences in microglia response in the primate when compared with the rodent, require use of adult human microglia in studies of microglia biology. While methods exist for isolation of microglia from postmortem human brains, none allow culturing cells to high passage. Thus cells from the same case could not be used in parallel studies and multiple conditions. Here we report a method, which includes use of growth factors such as granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, for successful culturing of adult human microglia from postmortem human brains up to 28 passages without significant loss of proliferation. Such cultures maintained their phenotype, including uptake of the scavenger receptor ligand acetylated low density lipoprotein and response to the amyloid-beta peptide, and were used to extend in vivo studies in the primate brain demonstrating that inhibition of microglia activation protects neurons from amyloid-beta toxicity. Significantly, microglia cultured from brains with pathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease displayed the same characteristics as microglia cultured from normal aged brains. The method described here provides the scientific community with a new and reliable tool for mechanistic studies of human microglia function in health from childhood to old age, and in disease, enhancing the relevance of the findings to the human brain and neurodegenerative conditions.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive assay validation campaign of a commercially available chemiluminescence multiplex immunoassay for the simultaneous measurement of the amyloid-beta peptides Abeta38, Abeta40, and Abeta42 in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is presented. The assay quality parameters we addressed included impact of sample dilution, parallelism, lower limits of detection, lower limits of quantification, intra- and inter-assay repeatability, analytical spike recoveries, and between laboratory reproducibility of the measurements. The assay performed well in our hands and fulfilled a number of predefined acceptance criteria. The CSF levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42 determined in a clinical cohort (n = 203) were statistically significantly correlated with available ELISA data of Abeta1-40 (n = 158) and Abeta1-42 (n = 179) from a different laboratory. However, Bland-Altman method comparison indicated systematic differences between the assays. The data presented here furthermore indicate that the CSF concentration of Abeta40 can surrogate total CSF Abeta and support the hypothesis that the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio outperforms CSF Abeta42 alone as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease due to a normalization to total Abeta levels.",

Such ring structures have a diameter of about 8-9 nm, an oligomer height of about 2- 4 nm, and an internal diameter of the ring of about 3-4 nm. Oligomers associate in a fibril in such a way that they interact with each other, overlapping slightly. There are differences in the packing of oligomers in fibrils of recombinant and synthetic Abeta peptides. The principal difference is in the degree of orderliness of ring-like oligomers that leads to generation of morphologically different fibrils. Most ordered association of ring-like structured oligomers is observed for a recombinant Abeta40 peptide. Less ordered fibrils are observed with the synthetic Abeta42 peptide. Fragments of fibrils the most protected from the action of proteases have been determined by tandem mass spectrometry. It was shown that unlike Abeta40, fibrils of Abeta42 are more protected, showing less ordered organization compared to that of Abeta40 fibrils. Thus, the mass spectrometry data agree with the electron microscopy data and structural models presented here.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Besides extracellular Abeta, intraneuronal Abeta (iAbeta) has been suggested to contribute to AD onset and development. Based on reported in vitro Abeta-DNA interactions and nuclear localization of iAbeta, the interference of iAbeta with the normal DNA expression has recently been proposed as a plausible pathway by which Abeta can exert neurotoxicity. Employing the sedimentation assay, thioflavin T fluorescence, and dynamic light scattering we have studied effects of zinc ions on binding of RNA and single- and double-stranded DNA molecules to Abeta42 aggregates. It has been found that zinc ions significantly enhance the binding of RNA and DNA molecules to pre-formed beta-sheet rich Abeta42 aggregates. Another type of Abeta42 aggregates, the zinc-induced amorphous aggregates, was demonstrated to also bind all types of nucleic acids tested. To evaluate the role of the Abeta metal-binding domain's histidine residues in Abeta-nucleic acid interactions mediated by zinc, Abeta16 mutants with substitutions H6R and H6A-H13A and rat Abeta16 lacking histidine residue 13 were used. The zinc-induced interaction of Abeta16 with DNA was shown to critically depend on histidine residues 6 and 13. However, the inclusion of H6R mutation in Abeta42 peptide did not affect DNA binding to Abeta42 aggregates. Since oxidative and/or nitrosative stresses implicated in AD pathogenesis are known to release zinc ions from metallothioneins in cytoplasm and cell nuclei, our findings suggest that intracellular zinc can be an important player in iAbeta-nucleic acid interactions.",

Another major factor in AD is arguably metal ions, as metal dyshomeostasis is observed in AD patients, metal ions modulate Abeta aggregation, and AD plaques contain numerous metals including redox-active Cu and Fe ions. In vivo, Abeta is found in various cellular locations including membranes. So far, Cu(II)/Abeta interactions and ROS generation have not been investigated in a membrane environment. Here, we study Cu(II) and Zn(II) interactions with Abeta bound to SDS micelles or to engineered aggregation-inhibiting molecules (the cyclic peptide CP-2 and the ZAbeta3(12-58)Y18L Affibody molecule). In all studied systems the Abeta N-terminal segment was found to be unbound, unstructured, and free to bind metal ions. In SDS micelles, Abeta was found to bind Cu(II) and Zn(II) with the same ligands and the same KD as in aqueous solution. ROS was generated in all Cu(II)/Abeta complexes. These results indicate that binding of Abeta to membranes, drugs, and other entities that do not interact with the Abeta N-terminal part, appears not to compromise the N-terminal segment's ability to bind metal ions, nor impede the capacity of N-terminally bound Cu(II) to generate ROS.",

In the cytoplasm Abeta influences activity of proteasomes, the multisubunit protein complexes that hydrolyze the majority of intracellular proteins. However, the manner in which Abeta affects the proteolytic activity of proteasomes has not been established. In this study the effect of Abeta42 and Abeta42 with isomerized Asp7 on activity of different forms of proteasomes has been analyzed. It has been shown that Abeta peptides efficiently reduce activity of the 20S proteasomes, but increase activity of the 20S proteasomes capped with the 19S and/or 11S regulators. Modulation of proteasome activity is mainly determined by the C-terminal segment of Abeta (amino acids 17-42).

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating neurological disease placing significant burden on health care budgets around the world. It is widely believed that accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain is a key event that initiates neurodegeneration, thus the clearance of Abeta from brain could be a key therapeutic strategy. Abeta exists in an equilibrium in healthy individuals, and recent research would suggest that dysfunction in the clearance pathways is the driving force behind its accumulation. One mechanism of clearance is proteolytic degradation by enzymes, and increasing the expression of these enzymes in animal models of Alzheimer's disease has indeed shown promising results. This approach could be challenging to translate into the clinic given the likely need for genetic manipulation. We hypothesize that stimulating the activity of these enzymes (as opposed to increasing expression) through pharmacological agents will enhance degradation or at least prevent amyloid deposition, and is therefore another potentially novel avenue to manipulate Abeta levels for therapeutic purposes. We discuss the recent research supporting this hypothesis as well as possible drawbacks to this approach.",

We identified the numerical order of the Soptimal as the characterizing Alzheimer's disease risk events (CARE) index to measure disease stage. The results show that, in the Soptimal, hippocampal and posterior cingulate cortex network biomarkers occur first, followed by aberrant cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta and p-tau levels, then cognitive deficit, and finally regional gray matter loss and fusiform network abnormality.

Here we describe footprinting of Abeta1-42 by hydroxyl radical-based fast photochemical oxidation of proteins (FPOP) and mass spectrometry (MS) to monitor the time-course of Abeta1-42 aggregation. We resolved five distinct stages characterized by two sigmoidal behaviors, showing the time-dependent transitions of monomers-paranuclei-protofibrils-fibrillar aggregates. Kinetic modeling allows deciphering the amounts and interconversion of the dominant Abeta1-42 species. Moreover, the irreversible footprinting probe provides insights into the kinetics of oligomerization and subsequent fibrillar growth by allowing the conformational changes of Abeta1-42 at subregional and even amino-acid-residue levels to be revealed. The middle domain of Abeta1-42 plays a major role in aggregation, whereas the N-terminus retains most of its solvent-accessibility during aggregation, and the hydrophobic C-terminus is involved to an intermediate extent. This approach affords an in situ, real-time monitoring of the solvent accessibility of Abeta1-42 at various stages of oligomerization, and provides new insights on site-specific aggregation of Abeta1-42 for a sample state beyond the capabilities of most other biophysical methods.",

    "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Emerging evidence suggests a role for sleep in contributing to the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD). Slow wave sleep (SWS) is the stage during which synaptic activity is minimal and clearance of neuronal metabolites is high, making it an ideal state to regulate levels of amyloid beta (Abeta). We thus aimed to examine relationships between concentrations of Abeta42 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and measures of SWS in cognitively normal elderly subjects. METHODS: Thirty-six subjects underwent a clinical and cognitive assessment, a structural MRI, a morning to early afternoon lumbar puncture, and nocturnal polysomnography. Correlations and linear regression analyses were used to assess for associations between CSF Abeta42 levels and measures of SWS controlling for potential confounders. Resulting models were compared to each other using ordinary least squared linear regression analysis. Additionally, the participant sample was dichotomized into \"high\" and \"low\" Abeta42 groups to compare SWS bout length using survival analyses. RESULTS: A significant inverse correlation was found between CSF Abeta42 levels, SWS duration and other SWS characteristics. Collectively, total SWA in the frontal lead was the best predictor of reduced CSF Abeta42 levels when controlling for age and ApoE status. Total sleep time, time spent in NREM1, NREM2, or REM sleep were not correlated with CSF Abeta42. CONCLUSIONS: In cognitively normal elderly, reduced and fragmented SWS is associated with increases in CSF Abeta42, suggesting that disturbed sleep might drive an increase in soluble brain Abeta levels prior to amyloid deposition.",

    "title": "Small molecule LX2343 ameliorates cognitive deficits in AD model mice by targeting both amyloid beta production and clearance.",
    "abstract": "AIM: Streptozotocin (STZ) is widely used to induce oxidative damage and to impair glucose metabolism, apoptosis, and tau/Abeta pathology, eventually leading to cognitive deficits in both in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we constructed a cell-based platform using STZ to induce stress conditions mimicking the complicated pathologies of AD in vitro, and evaluated the anti-amyloid effects of a small molecule, N-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-[5-chloro-2-methoxy(phenylsulfonyl)anilino]acetamide (LX2343) in the amelioration of cognitive deficits in AD model mice. METHODS: Cell-based assays for screening anti-amyloid compounds were established by assessing Abeta accumulation in HEK293-APPsw and CHO-APP cells, and Abeta clearance in primary astrocytes and SH-SY5Y cells after the cells were treated with STZ in the presence of the test compounds. Autophagic flux was observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. APP/PS1 transgenic mice were administered LX2343 (10 mg kg-1 d-1, ip) for 100 d. After LX2343 administration, cognitive ability of the mice was evaluated using Morris water maze test, and senile plaques in the brains were detected using Thioflavine S staining. ELISA assay was used to evaluate Abeta and sAPPbeta levels, while Western blot analysis was used to measure the signaling proteins in both cell and animal brains. RESULTS: LX2343 (5-20 mumol/L) dose-dependently decreased Abeta accumulation in HEK293-APPsw and CHO-APP cells, and promoted Abeta clearance in SH-SY5Y cells and primary astrocytes. The anti-amyloid effects of LX2343 were attributed to suppressing JNK-mediated APPThr668 phosphorylation, thus inhibiting APP cleavage on one hand, and inhibiting BACE1 enzymatic activity with an IC50 value of 11.43+-0.36 mumol/L, on the other hand. Furthermore, LX2343 acted as a non-ATP competitive PI3K inhibitor to negatively regulate AKT/mTOR signaling, thus promoting autophagy, and increasing Abeta clearance. Administration of LX2343 in APP/PS1 transgenic mice significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits and markedly ameliorated the Abeta pathology in their brains. CONCLUSION: LX2343 ameliorates cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS1 transgenic mice via both Abeta production inhibition and clearance promotion, which highlights the potential of LX2343 in the treatment of AD.",

In the present study, we investigated the pharmacological characteristics of the recently identified memory-enhancing compound, ISRIB for the amelioration of AD. ISRIB potently attenuated amyloid beta-induced neuronal cell death at concentrations of 12.5-25 nM, but did not inhibit amyloid beta production in the HEK293T cell line expressing the amyloid precursor protein (APP).

    "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and is associated with up to 5% of autism cases. Several promising drugs are in preclinical testing for FXS; however, bench-to-bedside plans for the clinic are severely limited due to lack of validated biomarkers and outcome measures. Published work from our laboratories has demonstrated altered levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta) precursor protein (APP) and its metabolites in FXS and idiopathic autism. Westmark and colleagues have focused on beta-secretase (amyloidogenic) processing and the accumulation of Abeta peptides in adult FXS models, whereas Lahiri and Sokol have studied alpha-secretase (non-amyloidogenic or anabolic) processing and altered levels of sAPPalpha and Abeta in pediatric autism and FXS. Thus, our groups have hypothesized a pivotal role for these Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related proteins in the neurodevelopmental disorders of FXS and autism. In this review, we discuss the contribution of APP metabolites to FXS and autism pathogenesis as well as the potential use of these metabolites as blood-based biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Our future focus is to identify key underlying mechanisms through which APP metabolites contribute to FXS and autism condition-to-disease pathology. Positive outcomes will support utilizing APP metabolites as blood-based biomarkers in clinical trials as well as testing drugs that modulate APP processing as potential disease therapeutics. Our studies to understand the role of APP metabolites in developmental conditions such as FXS and autism are a quantum leap for the neuroscience field, which has traditionally restricted any role of APP to AD and aging.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative measurements of change in beta-amyloid load from Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images play a critical role in clinical trials and longitudinal observational studies of Alzheimer's disease. These measurements are strongly affected by methodological differences between implementations, including choice of reference region and use of partial volume correction, but there is a lack of consensus for an optimal method. Previous works have examined some relevant variables under varying criteria, but interactions between them prevent choosing a method via combined meta-analysis. In this work, we present a thorough comparison of methods to measure change in beta-amyloid over time using Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET imaging. METHODS: We compare 1,024 different automated software pipeline implementations with varying methodological choices according to four quality metrics calculated over three-timepoint longitudinal trajectories of 129 subjects: reliability (straightness/variance); plausibility (lack of negative slopes); ability to predict accumulator/non-accumulator status from baseline value; and correlation between change in beta-amyloid and change in Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: From this analysis, we show that an optimal longitudinal measure of beta-amyloid from PiB should use a reference region that includes a combination of voxels in the supratentorial white matter and those in the whole cerebellum, measured using two-class partial volume correction in the voxel space of each subject's corresponding anatomical MR image.",

Despite considerable interest in developing gamma-secretase targeting therapeutics for the treatment of AD, the precise mechanism by which gamma-secretase produces Abeta has remained elusive. Herein, we demonstrate that gamma-secretase catalysis is driven by the stabilization of an enzyme-substrate scission complex via three distinct amino-acid-binding pockets in the enzyme's active site, providing the mechanism by which gamma-secretase preferentially cleaves APP in three amino acid increments. Substrate occupancy of these three pockets occurs after initial substrate binding but precedes catalysis, suggesting a conformational change in substrate may be required for cleavage. We uncover and exploit substrate cleavage preferences dictated by these three pockets to investigate the mechanism by which familial Alzheimer's disease mutations within APP increase the production of pathogenic Abeta species.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is primarily characterized by the progressive loss of functional neurons in the brain. Therefore, compounds with neuroprotective property may have therapeutic value in treating AD. Z-ligustilide (Z-LIG) is an essential oil originally isolated from umbelliferous plants. In the current study, the neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanisms of Z-LIG against fibrillar aggregates of Abeta25-35 and Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity were investigated in both SH-SY5Y cells and differentiated PC12 cells. Z-LIG at 1-30 muM provided an effective neuroprotection, as evidenced by the increase in cell viability, as well as the decrease in LDH release and intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Additionally, Z-LIG markedly blocked Abeta fibrils-induced condensed nuclei and sub-G1 accumulation suggestive of apoptosis. Furthermore, Z-LIG substantially reversed the activation of phosphorylated p38 and the inhibition of phosphorylated Akt caused by Abeta25-35. LY294002, the specific inhibitor of PI3-K, significantly abrogated the protein expression of up-regulated phosphorylated Akt offered by Z-LIG. Most importantly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of PI3-K and p38 significantly abolished the neuroprotective effects of Z-LIG. The results taken together indicate that Z-LIG protects against Abeta fibrils-induced neurotoxicity possibly through the inhibition of p38 and activation of PI3-K/Akt signaling pathways concurrently. Z-LIG might be a potential candidate for further preclinical study aimed at the prevention and treatment of AD.",

    "title": "Environmental Enrichment Potently Prevents Microglia-Mediated Neuroinflammation by Human Amyloid beta-Protein Oligomers.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Microglial dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a key contributor to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Environmental enrichment (EE) is well documented to enhance neuronal form and function, but almost nothing is known about whether and how it alters the brain's innate immune system. Here we found that prolonged exposure of naive wild-type mice to EE significantly altered microglial density and branching complexity in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus. In wild-type mice injected intraventricularly with soluble Abeta oligomers (oAbeta) from hAPP-expressing cultured cells, EE prevented several morphological features of microglial inflammation and consistently prevented oAbeta-mediated mRNA changes in multiple inflammatory genes both in vivo and in primary microglia cultured from the mice. Microdialysis in behaving mice confirmed that EE normalized increases in the extracellular levels of the key cytokines (CCL3, CCL4, TNFalpha) identified by the mRNA analysis. Moreover, EE prevented the changes in microglial gene expression caused by ventricular injection of oAbeta extracted directly from AD cerebral cortex. We conclude that EE potently alters the form and function of microglia in a way that prevents their inflammatory response to human oAbeta, suggesting that prolonged environmental enrichment could protect against AD by modulating the brain's innate immune system. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Environmental enrichment (EE) is a potential therapy to delay Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglial inflammation is associated with the progression of AD, but the influence of EE on microglial inflammation is unclear. Here we systematically applied in vivo methods to show that EE alters microglia in the dentate gyrus under physiological conditions and robustly prevents microglial inflammation induced by human Abeta oligomers, as shown by neutralized microglial inflammatory morphology, mRNA changes, and brain interstitial fluid cytokine levels. Our findings suggest that EE alters the innate immune system and could serve as a therapeutic approach to AD and provide new targets for drug discovery. Further, we propose that the therapeutic benefits of EE could extend to other neurodegenerative diseases involving microglial inflammation.",

    "abstract": "The oligomeric amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is thought to contribute to the subtle amnesic changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by causing synaptic dysfunction. Here, we examined the time course of synaptic changes in mouse hippocampal neurons following exposure to Abeta42 at picomolar concentrations, mimicking its physiological levels in the brain. We found opposite effects of the peptide with short exposures in the range of minutes enhancing synaptic plasticity, and longer exposures lasting several hours reducing it. The plasticity reduction was concomitant with an increase in the basal frequency of spontaneous neurotransmitter release, a higher basal number of functional presynaptic release sites, and a redistribution of synaptic proteins including the vesicle-associated proteins synapsin I, synaptophysin, and the post-synaptic glutamate receptor I. These synaptic alterations were mediated by cytoskeletal changes involving actin polymerization and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. These in vitro findings were confirmed in vivo with short hippocampal infusions of picomolar Abeta enhancing contextual memory and prolonged infusions impairing it. Our findings provide a model for initiation of synaptic dysfunction whereby exposure to physiologic levels of Abeta for a prolonged period of time causes microstructural changes at the synapse which result in increased transmitter release, failure of synaptic plasticity, and memory loss.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Suboptimal sleep has been reported as both a comorbidity and risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease. Previous research suggests that beta-amyloid (Abeta) may be central to this association, with reports indicating a bi-directional relationship between sleep and Abeta. Here, we review recent animal and human studies investigating the relationship between sleep and measures of Abeta, and explore the potential mechanisms underlying this association. RECENT FINDINGS: Two recent animal studies have provided further support for a bi-directional relationship between sleep and Abeta. In addition, five recent human studies support the notion that higher brain Abeta is linked to poor sleep in cognitively healthy individuals. One of the recent human studies utilized polysomnography to link brain Abeta to a disruption in slow wave activity during sleep, which in turn was associated with decreased hippocampal-dependent memory. SUMMARY: Recent findings indicate that poor sleep is a risk factor for brain Abeta deposition, and Abeta deposition contributes to sleep disruption. Through the conduct of more mechanistic studies, and both longitudinal and intervention human studies, we can further elucidate the clearly complex nature of the relationship between sleep and Abeta.",

    "abstract": "In a group of older adults with very mild dementia, we aimed to characterize the nature and magnitude of cognitive decline as measured by the Cogstate Brief Battery, in relation to Abeta levels and hippocampal volume. Participants were characterized according to their status on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. A total of 308 individuals who were CDR 0 and had low cerebral Abeta levels (Abeta-), 32 individuals who were Abeta- and CDR 0.5, and 43 individuals who were Abeta+ and CDR 0.5 were included in this study. Participants completed the CogState brief battery at baseline, and at 18-, 36-, 54- and 72-month follow-up. Linear mixed model analyses indicated that relative to the Abeta- CDR 0 group, the Abeta+ CDR 0.5 group showed increased rates of memory decline and hippocampal volume loss. However, compared to the Abeta- CDR 0 group, the Abeta- CDR 0.5 group showed no changes in cognitive function or hippocampal volume over 72 months. The results of this study confirm that in individuals with very mild dementia, who also have biomarker confirmation of Abeta+, changes in cognitive function manifest primarily as deterioration in memory processing, and this is associated with hippocampal volume loss. Conversely, the absence of any cognitive decline or loss in hippocampal volume in individuals with very mild dementia but who are Abeta- suggests that some other non-AD disease process may underlie any static impairment in cognitive function.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are routinely used for the differential diagnosis of rapidly progressive dementia, but are also affected by patients' characteristics. OBJECTIVE: To assess if stratification by age, sex, and genetic risk factors improves the accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in patients with rapidly progressive dementia. METHODS: 1,538 individuals with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), 173 with classic Alzheimer's disease (cAD), 37 with rapidly progressive Alzheimer's disease (rpAD), and 589 without signs of dementia were included in this retrospective diagnostic study. The effect of age, sex, PRNP codon 129, and APOE genotype on CSF levels of tau, p-tau, Abeta1-42, and Abeta1-40 values measured at time of diagnostic work-up was assessed. RESULTS: Tau was a better marker for the differentiation of CJD and rpAD in older (AUC:0.97; 95% CI:0.96-1.00) than in younger (AUC:0.91; 95% CI:0.87-0.94) patients as tau levels increased with age in CJD patients, but not in rpAD patients. PRNP codon 129 and APOE genotype had complex effects on biomarkers in all diseases, making stratification by genotype a powerful tool. In females (AUC:0.78; 95% CI:0.65-0.91) and patients older than 70 (AUC:0.78; 95% CI:0.62-0.93), tau was able to differentiate with moderate accuracy between cAD and rpAD patients. CONCLUSION: Implementation of stratum-specific reference ranges improves the diagnostic accuracy of CSF biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of rapidly progressive dementia. Diagnostic criteria developed for this setting have to take this into account.",

    "abstract": "Proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) by secretases leads to extracellular release of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. Increased production of Abeta42 over Abeta40 and aggregation into oligomers and plaques constitute an Alzheimer's disease (AD) hallmark. Identifying products of the 'human chemical exposome' (HCE) able to induce Abeta42 production may be a key to understanding some of the initiating causes of AD and to generate non-genetic, chemically-induced AD animal models. A cell model was used to screen HCE libraries for Abeta42 inducers. Out of 3500+ compounds, six triazine herbicides were found that induced a beta- and gamma-secretases-dependent, 2-10 fold increase in the production of extracellular Abeta42 in various cell lines, primary neuronal cells, and neurons differentiated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry analyses show enhanced production of Abeta peptides cleaved at positions 42/43, and reduced production of peptides cleaved at positions 38 and lower, a characteristic of AD. Neurons derived from iPSCs obtained from a familial AD (FAD) patient (AbetaPP K724N) produced more Abeta42 versus Abeta40 than neurons derived from healthy controls iPSCs (AbetaPP WT). Triazines enhanced Abeta42 production in both control and AD iPSCs-derived neurons. Triazines also shifted the cleavage pattern of alcadeinalpha, another gamma-secretase substrate, suggesting a direct effect of triazines on gamma-secretase activity. In conclusion, several widely used triazines enhance the production of toxic, aggregation prone Abeta42/Abeta43 amyloids, suggesting the possible existence of environmental \"Alzheimerogens\" which may contribute to the initiation and propagation of the amyloidogenic process in late-onset AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Correctly diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in prodromal phases would allow the adoption of experimental therapeutic strategies that could selectively interrupt the pathogenetic process before neuronal damage becomes irreversible. Therefore, great efforts have been aimed at finding early reliable disease markers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify a simple, cost effective, and reliable diagnostic algorithm to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. METHODS: 96 consecutive MCI patients admitted to the Neurology department of San Raffaele Hospital in Milan between January 2009 and January 2015 were included. All patients underwent neuropsychological assessment and lumbar puncture with CSF analysis of amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42), total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels. Each patient underwent clinical and neuropsychological follow-up, in order to identify a possible progression from MCI to AD. The mean follow up time was 36.73 months. RESULTS: 37 out of 96 MCI converted to AD during follow up. CSF analysis and neuropsychological assessment reliably detected MCI patients who developed AD. In a subsample of 43 subjects, a Composite Cognitive Score (CCS) was calculated including episodic memory, executive function, and verbal fluency tests. Combining together CSF biomarkers and CCS increased the accuracy of the single predictors, correctly classifying 86% of patients with a specificity of 96% and a Positive Predictive Value of 93%. DISCUSSION: Even if preliminary, our data seem to suggest that CSF analysis and neuropsychological assessment could detect MCI patients who will convert to AD with high confidence. Their relative low cost and availability could make them worldwide essential tools in future clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta is a multifunctional protein that has been implicated in the pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including the heightened levels of neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid-beta (Abeta), and neurodegeneration. We have previously shown that an antisense oligonucleotide directed at the Tyr 216 site on GSK-3beta (GAO) when injected centrally can decrease GSK-3beta levels, improve learning and memory, and decrease oxidative stress. In addition, we showed that GAO can cross the blood-brain barrier. Herein the impact of peripherally administered GAO in both the non-transgenic SAMP8 and transgenic Tg2576 (APPswe) models of AD were examined respective to learning and memory. Brain tissues were then evaluated for expression changes in the phosphorylated-Tyr 216 residue, which leads to GSK-3beta activation, and the phosphorylated-Ser9 residue, which reduces GSK-3beta activity. SAMP8 GAO-treated mice showed improved acquisition and retention using aversive T-maze, and improved declarative memory as measured by the novel object recognition (NOR) test. Expression of the phosphorylated-Tyr 216 was decreased and the phosphorylated-Ser9 was increased in GAO-treated SAMP8 mice. Tg2576 GAO-treated mice improved acquisition and retention in both the T-maze and NOR tests, with an increased phosphorylated-Ser9 GSK-3beta expression. Results demonstrate that peripheral administration of GAO improves learning and memory, corresponding with alterations in GSK-3beta phosphorylation state. This study supports peripherally administered GAO as a viable means to mediate GSK-3beta activity within the brain and a possible treatment for AD.",

    "title": "Purported Interactions of Amyloid-beta and Glucocorticoids in Cytotoxicity and Genotoxicity: Implications in Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of aggregates of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) that are believed to be neurotoxic. One of the purposed damaging mechanisms of Abeta is oxidative insult, which eventually could damage the cellular genome. Stress and associated increases in glucocorticoids (GCs) have been described as a risk factor for the development of AD, although the purported genotoxic effects of GCs have not been fully characterized. Therefore, it is possible to speculate about purported synergistic effects of GCs on the Abeta-driven genotoxic damage. This in vitro study addresses the single and combined cyto/genotoxic effects of Abeta and GCs in SH-SY5Y cells. Cytotoxicity was determined by the MTT assay, and the genotoxic effects were studied using the comet assay. A comet assay derivation allows for measuring the presence of the FPG-sensitive sites (mainly 8-oxoguanines) in the DNA, apart from the DNA strand breaks. Treatment with Abeta (10 muM, 72 h) induced cytotoxicity (35% decrease in cell viability) and DNA strand breaks, but had no significant effect on oxidative DNA damage (FPG sites). Corticosterone showed no effect on cell viability, genotoxicity, or reparation processes. Corticosterone was unable to neither reverse nor potentiate Abeta driven effects. The present results suggest the existence of alternative mechanisms for the Abeta driven damage, not involving oxidative damage of DNA. In addition, could be suggested that the interaction between Abeta and GCs in AD does not seem to involve DNA damage.",

    "title": "The anti-inflammatory Annexin A1 induces the clearance and degradation of the amyloid-beta peptide.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The toxicity of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide present in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is thought to be mediated via the increased secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, which can lead to neuronal dysfunction and cell death. In addition, we have previously shown that inflammation can affect Abeta generation. More recently, we have reported that in vitro administration of the anti-inflammatory mediator Annexin A1 (ANXA1) following an inflammatory challenge suppressed microglial activation and this effect was mediated through formyl peptide receptor-like 1 (FPRL1/FPR2) signalling. The aim of this study was to determine the potential role of ANXA1 in the generation and clearance of Abeta. METHODS: We first compared ANXA1 protein expression in the brains of AD patients and healthy controls as well as in the 5XFAD model of AD. To determine the role of ANXA1 in the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the degradation of Abeta, N2a neuroblastoma cells were treated with human recombinant ANXA1 or transfected with ANXA1 siRNA. We also investigated the effect of ANXA1 on Abeta phagocytosis and microglial activation in BV2 cells treated with synthetic Abeta. RESULTS: Our data show that ANXA1 is increased in the brains of AD patients and animal models of AD at early stages. ANXA1 was able to reduce the levels of Abeta by increasing its enzymatic degradation by neprilysin in N2a cells and to stimulate Abeta phagocytosis by microglia. These effects were mediated through FPRL1 receptors. In addition, ANXA1 inhibited the Abeta-stimulated secretion of inflammatory mediators by microglia. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that ANXA1 plays a pivotal role in Abeta clearance and supports the use of ANXA1 as potential pharmacological tool for AD therapeutics.",

While its persistence in Alzheimer's cases is well-studied, amyloid beta's direct effect on vascular function is unclear. Here, we measured the effect of amyloid beta treatment on vascular smooth muscle cell functional contractility and modeled the mechanoadaptive growth and remodeling response to these functional perturbations. We found that the amyloid beta 1-42 isoform induced a reduction in vascular smooth muscle cell mechanical output and reduced response to vasocontractile cues. These data were used to develop a thin-walled constrained mixture arterial model that suggests vessel growth, and remodeling in response to amyloid betamediated alteration of smooth muscle function leads to decreased ability of cerebrovascular vessels to vasodilate. These findings provide a possible explanation for the vascular injury and malfunction often associated with the development of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "A wide consensus based on robust experimental evidence indicates pyroglutamylated amyloid-beta isoform (AbetapE3-42) as one of the most neurotoxic peptides involved in the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, AbetapE3-42 co-oligomerized with excess of Abeta1-42, produces oligomers and aggregates that are structurally distinct and far more cytotoxic than those made from Abeta1-42 alone. Here, we investigate quantitatively the influence of AbetapE3-42 on biophysical properties and biological activity of Abeta1-42. We tested different ratios of AbetapE3-42/Abeta1-42 mixtures finding a correlation between the biological activity and the structural conformation and morphology of the analyzed mixtures. We find that a mixture containing 5% AbetapE3-42, induces the highest disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis and the highest neuronal toxicity. These data correlate to an high content of relaxed antiparallel beta-sheet structure and the coexistence of a population of big spheroidal aggregates together with short fibrils. Our experiments provide also evidence that AbetapE3-42 causes template-induced misfolding of Abeta1-42 at ratios below 33%. This means that there exists a critical concentration required to have seeding on Abeta1-42 aggregation, above this threshold, the seed effect is not possible anymore and AbetapE3-42 controls the total aggregation kinetics.",

The aim of this study was to examine the protective effect and possible protective mechanism of testosterone (T) on cognitive performance in male rats induced by intrahippocampal injections of beta amyloid 1-42 oligomers (Abeta1-42). Treatment with T as evidenced by the Morris water maze (MWM) test significantly shortened escape latency and reduced path length to reach the platform compared to the control (C). During probe trials, the T group displayed a significantly greater percent of time in the target quadrant and improved the number of platform crossings compared with C, flutamide (F), an antiandrogen, and a combined F and T group. Flutamide markedly inhibited the influence of T on cognitive performance. Following Nissl staining, the number of intact pyramidal cells was significantly elevated in the T group, and the effect of T was blocked by F. Immunohistochemisty and Western blot analysis showed that the protein expression level of Abeta 1-42 was markedly decreased and expression levels of synaptophysin (SYN) significantly increased with T, while F inhibited all T-mediated effects. Our data suggest that the influence of T on cognitive performance was mediated via androgen receptors (AR) to remove beta amyloid, which leads to enhanced synaptic plasticity.",

Neurotrophic factors are promising for AD treatment and are integrally involved in neuronal growth, survival and maintenance. Cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF) was recently discovered to have beneficial effects on long-term memory. The present study explored the synaptoprotective effects of CDNF in Abeta-treated primary hippocampal cells. Immunofluorescent analysis of synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) puncta densities in the group of pretreatment with CDNF before Abeta exposure revealed significant improvements compared to Abeta group. In addition, pretreatment with CDNF reduced the expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related proteins, including Bip (also known as GRP78), phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha (peIF2alpha), phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (pJNK), and cleaved caspase 3, which are increased by Abeta treatment at early stage. Our results revealed protective effects of CDNF on Abeta-induced synaptotoxicity and ER stress, implying that CDNF may protect against Abeta-induced synaptotoxicity through suppression of ER stress. CDNF could be a potential drug candidate for early AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "A novel method for preconcentration and purification of the Alzheimer's disease related amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides by isoelectric focusing (IEF) in 75 nL microchannels combined with their analysis by micropillar-matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) is presented. A semiopen chip-based setup, consisting of open microchannels covered by a lid of a liquid fluorocarbon, was used. IEF was performed in a mixture of four small and chemically well-defined amphoteric carriers, glutamic acid, aspartyl-histidine (Asp-His), cycloserine (cSer), and arginine, which provided a stepwise pH gradient tailored for focusing of the C-terminal Abeta peptides with a pI of 5.3 in the boundary between cSer and Asp-His. Information about the focusing dynamics and location of the foci of Abeta peptides and other compounds was obtained using computer simulation and by performing MALDI-MS analysis directly from the open microchannel. With the established configuration, detection was performed by direct sampling of a nanoliter volume containing the focused Abeta peptides from the microchannel, followed by deposition of this volume onto a chip with micropillar MALDI targets. In addition to purification, IEF preconcentration provides at least a 10-fold increase of the MALDI-MS-signal. After immunoprecipitation and concentration of the eluate in the microchannel, IEF-micropillar-MALDI-MS is demonstrated to be a suitable platform for detection of Abeta peptides in human cerebrospinal fluid as well as in blood plasma.",

Misfolded protein oligomers formed during the process of aggregation have been identified as the primary pathogenic agents in many such conditions. Here, we show the existence of a quantitative relationship between the degree of binding to neuronal cells of different types of oligomers formed from a model protein, HypF-N, and the GM1 content of the plasma membranes. In addition, remarkably similar behavior is observed for oligomers of the Abeta42 peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease. Further analysis has revealed the existence of a linear correlation between the level of the influx of Ca(2+) across neuronal membranes that triggers cellular damage, and the fraction of oligomeric species bound to the membrane. Our findings indicate that the susceptibility of neuronal cells to different types of misfolded oligomeric assemblies is directly related to the extent of binding of such oligomers to the cellular membrane.",

However, Abeta peptides are also detectable in secretory compartments and peripheral blood contains a complex mixture of more than 40 different modified and/or N- and C-terminally truncated Abeta peptides. Recently, anti-infective properties of Abeta peptides have been reported. Here, we investigated the interaction of Abeta peptides of different lengths with various bacterial strains and the yeast Candida albicans. The amyloidogenic peptides Abeta1-42, Abeta2-42, and Abeta3p-42 but not the non-amyloidogenic peptides Abeta1-40 and Abeta2-40 bound to microbial surfaces. As observed by immunocytochemistry, scanning electron microscopy and Gram staining, treatment of several bacterial strains and Candida albicans with Abeta peptide variants ending at position 42 (Abetax-42) caused the formation of large agglutinates. These aggregates were not detected after incubation with Abetax-40. Furthermore, Abetax-42 exerted an antimicrobial activity on all tested pathogens, killing up to 80% of microorganisms within 6 h. Abeta1-40 only had a moderate antimicrobial activity against C. albicans. Agglutination of Abeta1-42 was accelerated in the presence of microorganisms. These data demonstrate that the amyloidogenic Abetax-42 variants have antimicrobial activity and may therefore act as antimicrobial peptides in the immune system.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Despite the demonstration that amyloid-beta (Abeta) can trigger increased tau phosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation in vivo, the molecular link associating Abeta and tau pathologies remains ill defined. Here, we observed that exposure of cultured primary neurons to Abeta trimers isolated from brain tissue of subjects with Alzheimer's disease led to a specific conformational change of tau detected by the antibody Alz50. A similar association was supported by postmortem human brain analyses. To study the role of Abeta trimers in vivo, we created a novel bigenic Tg-Abeta+Tau mouse line by crossing Tg2576 (Tg-Abeta) and rTg4510 (Tg-Tau) mice. Before neurodegeneration and amyloidosis, apparent Abeta trimers were increased by ~2-fold in 3-month-old Tg-Abeta and Tg-Abeta+Tau mice compared with younger mice, whereas soluble monomeric Abeta levels were unchanged. Under these conditions, the expression of soluble Alz50-tau conformers rose by ~2.2-fold in the forebrains of Tg-Abeta+Tau mice compared with nontransgenic littermates. In parallel, APP accumulated intracellularly, suggestive of a putative dysfunction of anterograde axonal transport. We found that the protein abundance of the kinesin-1 light chain (KLC1) was reduced selectively in vivo and in vitro when soluble Abeta trimers/Alz50-tau were present. Importantly, the reduction in KLC1 was prevented by the intraneuronal delivery of Alz50 antibodies. Collectively, our findings reveal that specific soluble conformers of Abeta and tau cooperatively disrupt axonal transport independently from plaques and tangles. Finally, these results suggest that not all endogenous Abeta oligomers trigger the same deleterious changes and that the role of each assembly should be considered separately. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The mechanistic link between amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau, the two major proteins composing the neuropathological lesions detected in brain tissue of Alzheimer's disease subjects, remains unclear. Here, we report that the trimeric Abeta species induce a pathological modification of tau in cultured neurons and in bigenic mice expressing Abeta and human tau. This linkage was also observed in postmortem brain tissue from subjects with mild cognitive impairment, when Abeta trimers are abundant. Further, this modification of tau was associated with the intracellular accumulation of the precursor protein of Abeta, APP, as a result of the selective decrease in kinesin light chain 1 expression. Our findings suggest that Abeta trimers might cause axonal transport deficits in AD.",

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Decline in cognitive skills, especially in memory, is often viewed as part of \"normal\" aging. Yet some individuals \"age better\" than others. Building on prior research showing that cortical thickness in one brain region, the anterior midcingulate cortex, is preserved in older adults with memory performance abilities equal to or better than those of people 20-30 years younger (i.e., \"superagers\"), we examined the structural integrity of two large-scale intrinsic brain networks in superaging: the default mode network, typically engaged during memory encoding and retrieval tasks, and the salience network, typically engaged during attention, motivation, and executive function tasks. We predicted that superagers would have preserved cortical thickness in critical nodes in these networks. We defined superagers (60-80 years old) based on their performance compared to young adults (18-32 years old) on the California Verbal Learning Test Long Delay Free Recall test. We found regions within the networks of interest where the cerebral cortex of superagers was thicker than that of typical older adults, and where superagers were anatomically indistinguishable from young adults; hippocampal volume was also preserved in superagers. Within the full group of older adults, thickness of a number of regions, including the anterior temporal cortex, rostral medial prefrontal cortex, and anterior midcingulate cortex, correlated with memory performance, as did the volume of the hippocampus. These results indicate older adults with youthful memory abilities have youthful brain regions in key paralimbic and limbic nodes of the default mode and salience networks that support attentional, executive, and mnemonic processes subserving memory function. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Memory performance typically declines with age, as does cortical structural integrity, yet some older adults maintain youthful memory. We tested the hypothesis that superagers (older individuals with youthful memory performance) would exhibit preserved neuroanatomy in key brain networks subserving memory. We found that superagers not only perform similarly to young adults on memory testing, they also do not show the typical patterns of brain atrophy in certain regions. These regions are contained largely within two major intrinsic brain networks: the default mode network, implicated in memory encoding, storage, and retrieval, and the salience network, associated with attention and executive processes involved in encoding and retrieval. Preserved neuroanatomical integrity in these networks is associated with better memory performance among older adults.",

Experimental evidence has shown intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta peptides and interference with mitochondrial functions. Nevertheless, the relevance of intracellular Abeta peptides in the pathophysiology of AD is controversial. Here we found that the two major species of Abeta peptides, in particular Abeta42, exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on the preprotein import reactions essential for mitochondrial biogenesis. However, Abeta peptides interacted only weakly with mitochondria and did not affect the inner membrane potential or the structure of the preprotein translocase complexes. Abeta peptides significantly decreased the import competence of mitochondrial precursor proteins via an extramitochondrial coaggregation mechanism. Coaggregation and import inhibition were significantly stronger for the longer peptide Abeta42, correlating with its importance in AD pathology. Our results demonstrate that direct interference of aggregation-prone Abeta peptides with mitochondrial protein biogenesis represents a crucial aspect of the pathobiochemical mechanisms contributing to cellular damage in AD.",

Observational studies suggest that aspirin use may induce cerebral microbleeds, and associated overt intracranial hemorrhage, but this has not been definitively resolved. Aims ASPREE-NEURO will determine the effect of aspirin on cerebral microbleed development over three years in healthy adults aged 70 years and over, participating in the larger 'ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE)' primary prevention study of aspirin. Sample size Five hundred and fifty-nine participants provide 75% power (two-sided p value of 0.05) to determine an average difference of 0.5 cerebral microbleed per person after three years. Methods and design A multi-center, randomized placebo-controlled trial of 100 mg daily aspirin in participants who have brain magnetic resonance imaging at study entry, one and three years after randomization and who undergo cognitive testing at the same time points. Study outcomes The primary outcome is the number of new cerebral microbleeds on magnetic resonance imaging after three years. Secondary outcomes are the number of new cerebral microbleeds after one year, change in volume of white matter hyperintensity, cognitive function, and stroke. Discussion ASPREE-NEURO will resolve whether aspirin affects the presence and number of cerebral microbleeds, their relationship with cognitive performance, and indicate whether consideration of cerebral microbleeds alters the risk-benefit profile of aspirin in primary prevention for older people.

    "title": "Dual Kinase Inhibition Affords Extended in vitro Neuroprotection in Amyloid-beta Toxicity.",
    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the amyloid cascade hypothesis proposes that amyloid-beta (Abeta) neurotoxicity leads to neuroinflammation, synaptic loss, and neuronal degeneration. In AD patients, anti-amyloid immunotherapies did not succeed because they were possibly administered late in AD progression. Modulating new targets associated with Abeta toxicity, such as PKR (double-stranded RNA dependent kinase), and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) is a major goal for neuroprotection. These two pro-apoptotic kinases are activated in AD brains and involved in Abeta production, tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal death. In HEK cells transfected with siRNA directed against PKR, and in PKR knockout (PKR-/-) mice neurons, we showed that PKR triggers JNK activation. Abeta-induced neuronal apoptosis, measured by cleaved PARP (Poly ADP-ribose polymerase) and cleaved caspase 3 levels, was reduced in PKR-/- neurons. Two selective JNK inhibitory peptides also produced a striking reduction of Abeta toxicity. Finally, the dual inhibition of PKR and JNK nearly abolished Abeta toxicity in primary cultured neurons. These results reveal that dual kinase inhibition can afford neuroprotection and this approach is worth being tested in in vivo AD and oxidative stress models.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents one of the most dramatic threats to healthy aging and devising effective treatments for this devastating condition remains a major challenge in biomedical research. Much has been learned about the molecular concepts that govern proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein to amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta), and how accelerated accumulation of neurotoxic Abeta peptides underlies neuronal cell death in rare familial but also common sporadic forms of this disease. Out of a plethora of proposed modulators of amyloidogenic processing, one protein emerged as a key factor in AD pathology, a neuronal sorting receptor termed SORLA. Independent approaches using human genetics, clinical pathology, or exploratory studies in animal models all converge on this receptor that is now considered a central player in AD-related processes by many. This review will provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence implicating SORLA-mediated protein sorting in neurodegenerative processes, and how receptor gene variants in the human population impair functional receptor expression in sporadic but possibly also in autosomal-dominant forms of AD.",

The [CpRe/99mTc(CO)3] complexes were prepared by double ligand transfer reactions from ferrocene precursors, and the X-ray structure of one rhenium surrogate revealed a classical \"piano stool\" like geometry. Several of the rhenium complexes displayed high affinity for Abeta1-42 aggregates in in vitro inhibition assays, and they could intensely stain Abeta deposits on brain sections from transgenic mice and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Complex [99mTc]4h strongly binds to Abeta deposits in blood vessels of the brain section of AD patients in in vitro autoradiography. Biodistribution experiments in normal mice revealed that 99mTc-labeled tracers exhibited moderate degree of initial brain uptake (0.54%-1.06% ID/g at 2 min). These tracers targeting Abeta plaques of AD patients warrant further structure optimization to improve their ability to penetrate blood-brain barrier, moreover, they may be suitable for developing imaging probes for targeting amyloid aggregates outside of the brain.",

Among the enzymes known to degrade Abeta in vivo are endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE)-1, ECE-2, and neprilysin (NEP), and evidence suggests that they regulate independent pools of Abeta that may be functionally significant. To better understand the differential regulation of Abeta concentration by its physiological degrading enzymes, we characterized the cell and region-specific expression pattern of ECE-1, ECE-2, and NEP by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in brain areas relevant to Alzheimer's disease. In contrast to the broader distribution of ECE-1, ECE-2 and NEP were found enriched in GABAergic neurons. ECE-2 was majorly expressed by somatostatin-expressing interneurons and was active in isolated synaptosomes. NEP messenger RNA was found mainly in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, with NEP protein localized to perisomatic parvalbuminergic synapses. The identification of somatostatinergic and parvalbuminergic synapses as hubs for Abeta degradation is consistent with the possibility that Abeta may have a physiological function related to the regulation of inhibitory signaling.",

    "abstract": "Although historically perceived as a disorder confined to the brain, our understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has expanded to include extra-cerebral manifestation, with mounting evidence of abnormalities in the eye. Among ocular tissues, the retina, a developmental outgrowth of the brain, is marked by an array of pathologies in patients suffering from AD, including nerve fiber layer thinning, degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, and changes to vascular parameters. While the hallmark pathological signs of AD, amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) comprising hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) protein, have long been described in the brain, identification of these characteristic biomarkers in the retina has only recently been reported. In particular, Abeta deposits were discovered in post-mortem retinas of advanced and early stage cases of AD, in stark contrast to non-AD controls. Subsequent studies have reported elevated Abeta42/40 peptides, morphologically diverse Abeta plaques, and pTau in the retina. In line with the above findings, animal model studies have reported retinal Abeta deposits and tauopathy, often correlated with local inflammation, retinal ganglion cell degeneration, and functional deficits. This review highlights the converging evidence that AD manifests in the eye, especially in the retina, which can be imaged directly and non-invasively. Visual dysfunction in AD patients, traditionally attributed to well-documented cerebral pathology, can now be reexamined as a direct outcome of retinal abnormalities. As we continue to study the disease in the brain, the emerging field of ocular AD warrants further investigation of how the retina may faithfully reflect the neurological disease. Indeed, detection of retinal AD pathology, particularly the early presenting amyloid biomarkers, using advanced high-resolution imaging techniques may allow large-scale screening and monitoring of at-risk populations.",

    "abstract": "Abeta deposition is a driving force of Alzheimer's disease pathology and can be detected early by amyloid positron emission tomography. Identifying presymptomatic structural brain changes associated with Abeta deposition might lead to a better understanding of its consequences and provide early diagnostic information. In this respect we analyzed measures of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes along with hippocampal, thalamic and striatal shape and surface area by applying novel analysis strategies for structural magnetic resonance imaging. We included 69 cognitively normal elderly subjects after careful clinical and neuropsychological workup. Standardized uptake value ratios (cerebellar reference) for uptake of 11-C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) were calculated from positron emission tomographic data for a cortical measurement and for bilateral hippocampus, thalamus and striatum. Associations to shape, surface area, volume and cortical thickness were tested using regression models that included significant predictors as covariates. Left anterior hippocampal shape was associated with regional PiB uptake (P < 0.05, FDR corrected), whereas volumes of the hippocampi and their subregions were not associated with cortical or regional PiB uptake (all P > 0.05, FDR corrected). Within the entorhinal cortical region of both hemispheres, thickness was negatively associated with cortical PiB uptake (P < 0.05, FDR corrected). Hence, localized shape measures and cortical thickness may be potential biomarkers of presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease.",

Abeta is also found in bodily fluids such as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. However, the significance of Abeta accumulation in the brain and different bodily pools, as well as its correlation with aging and cerebral amyloid pathology, is not completely understood. To better understand this question, we selected the rhesus monkey, which is phylogenetically and physiologically highly similar to the human, as a model to study. We quantified the levels of the two main Abeta isoforms (Abeta42 and Abeta40) in different sections of the brain (frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and hippocampus) and bodily fluids (CSF and plasma) of rhesus monkeys at different developmental phases (young, 5-9 years of age; mature, 10-19 years of age; and old, 21-24 years of age). We found that the levels of neuronal and insoluble Abeta42 increased significantly in the brain with aging, suggesting that this specific isoform might be directly involved in aging and AD-like pathophysiology. There was no significant change in the Abeta40 level in the brain with aging. In addition, the Abeta42 level, but not the Abeta40 level, in both the CSF and plasma increased with aging. We also identified a positive correlation between Abeta42 in the CSF and plasma and Abeta42 in the brain. Taken collectively, our results indicate that there is an association between Abeta accumulation and age. These results support the increased incidence of AD with aging.",

We found good agreement between the (13)C and (15)N NMR chemical shifts indicative for a similar secondary structure of both fibrils. A well-known interresidual contact between the two beta-strands of the Abeta fibrils could be confirmed by the detection of interresidual cross peaks in a (13)C-(13)C NMR correlation spectrum between the side chains of Phe 19 and Leu 34.

    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Intraneuronal calcium stimulates the calpain-dependent conversion of p35 to p25, a CDK5 activator. It is widely believed that amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) induces this conversion that, in turn, has an essential role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. However, in vivo studies on p25 generation used transgenic mice overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin (PS). Here, using single App knock-in mice, we show that p25 generation is an artifact caused by membrane protein overexpression. We show that massive Abeta42 accumulation without overexpression of APP or presenilin does not produce p25, whereas p25 generation occurred with APP/PS overexpression and in postmortem mouse brain. We further support this finding using mice deficient for calpastatin, the sole calpain-specific inhibitor protein. Thus, the intracerebral environment of the APP/PS mouse brain and postmortem brain is an unphysiological state. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We recently estimated using single App knock-in mice that accumulate amyloid beta peptide without transgene overexpression that 60% of the phenotypes observed in Alzheimer's model mice overexpressing mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) or APP and presenilin are artifacts (Saito et al., 2014). The current study further supports this estimate by invalidating key results from papers that were published in Cell These findings suggest that more than 3000 publications based on APP and APP/PS overexpression must be reevaluated.",

    "abstract": "Pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include extracellularly accumulated amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Activated microglia, brain-resident macrophages, are also found surrounding Abeta plaques. The study of the brain of AD mouse models revealed that Abeta plaque formation is completed by the consolidation of newly generated plaque clusters in vicinity of existed plaques. However, the dynamics of Abeta plaque formation, growth and the mechanisms by which microglia contribute to Abeta plaque formation are unknown. In the present study, we confirmed how microglia are involved in Abeta plaque formation and their growth in the brain of 5XFAD mice, the Abeta-overexpressing AD transgenic mouse model, and performed serial intravital two-photon microscopy (TPM) imaging of the brains of 5XFAD mice crossed with macrophage/microglia-specific GFP-expressing CX3CR1GFP/GFP mice. We found that activated microglia surrounding Abeta plaques take up Abeta, which are clusters developed inside activated microglia in vivo and this was followed by microglial cell death. These dying microglia release the accumulated Abeta into the extracellular space, which contributes to Abeta plaque growth. This process was confirmed by live TPM in vivo imaging and flow cytometry. These results suggest that activated microglia can contribute to formation and growth of Abeta plaques by causing microglial cell death in the brain. GLIA 2016;64:2274-2290.",

The structures and thermodynamic properties of the divalent copper ion bound amyloid-beta(40) and amyloid-beta(42) alloforms in an aqueous medium are studied. The secondary and tertiary structures of divalent copper ion bound amyloid-beta(40) and amyloid-beta(42) along with their thermodynamic properties including enthalpy, entropy, Gibbs free energy and potential of mean force surface are investigated. Results are compared to those for apo amyloid-beta and divalent zinc ion bound amyloid-beta alloforms. Results demonstrate that copper binding to Abeta alloforms is thermodynamically less preferred rather than zinc binding. Less compact structures of copper ion bound amyloid-beta alloforms possess reduced stability in comparison to zinc ion bound amyloid-beta alloforms.

We target the difficulties of image reading and possible shortcomings of the SUVr methods by validating a new semi-quantitative approach named ELBA. ELBA involves a minimal image preprocessing and does not rely on small, specific regions of interest (ROIs). It evaluates the whole brain and delivers a geometrical/intensity score to be used for ranking and dichotomic assessment. The method was applied to adniimages 18F-florbetapir images from the ADNI database. Five expert readers provided visual assessment in blind and open sessions. The longitudinal trend and the comparison to SUVr measurements were also evaluated. ELBA performed with area under the roc curve (AUC) = 0.997 versus the visual assessment. The score was significantly correlated to the SUVr values (r = 0.86, p < 10-4). The longitudinal analysis estimated a test/retest error of  2.3%. Cohort and longitudinal analysis suggests that the ELBA method accurately ranks the brain amyloid burden. The expert readers confirmed its relevance in aiding the visual assessment in a significant number (85) of difficult cases.

Herein, we illustrate the interactions between amylin oligomers and non-amyloid beta component (NAC) oligomers. Using molecular dynamics simulations and statistical calculations, we studied the mechanisms through which NAC oligomers interact with amylin oligomers to form NAC-amylin hetero-oligomers. Our simulations have shown that there are more than one possible pathways, which form the NAC-amylin hetero-oligomers. Our structural analyses demonstrate that the interactions in the NAC-amylin hetero-oligomers do not affect the structural features of the NAC oligomers, but they do stabilize the structures of the amylin oligomers. Taken together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that NAC oligomers may interact with amylin oligomers through several pathways, of which some pathways are more preferred because of the structural stability of the cross-seeding NAC-amylin oligomers.",

    "title": "Functional modulation of strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors in rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons by amyloid-beta protein (1-42).",
    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is considered a key protein in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease because of its neurotoxicity, resulting in impaired synaptic function and memory. On the other hand, it was demonstrated that low (picomolar) concentrations of Abeta enhance synaptic plasticity and memory, suggesting that in the healthy brain, physiological Abeta concentrations are necessary for normal cognitive functions. In the present study, we found that Abeta (1-42) in concentrations of 10 pM - 100nM enhanced desensitization of the glycine-activated current in isolated CA3 pyramidal neurons and also reversibly suppressed its peak amplitude during short (600ms) co-application with agonist. The effect was most prominent at low glycine concentrations. When glycine receptors were activated by other receptor agonists - taurine and beta-alanine, the changes of current kinetics and amplitudes induced by Abeta had a similar character. When Abeta (100 pM) was added to the bath solution, it caused, besides acceleration of desensitization, more pronounced reduction of peak current amplitude. This effect developed slowly, during a few minutes, and was more prominent at saturating concentrations of agonists. The results suggest that Abeta interacts with glycine receptors through three different mechanisms - by enhancing receptor desensitization, by rapid inhibition of the receptor, and also by means of a slowly developing inhibition of the amplitude of the current, possibly through intracellular mechanisms. The observed changes in the activity of glycine receptors induced by Abeta can lead to suppression of the tonic inhibition of hippocampal neurons mediated by extrasynaptic glycine receptors.",

    "title": "Amyloid beta precursor protein regulates neuron survival and maturation in the adult mouse brain.",
    "abstract": "The amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) is a transmembrane protein that is widely expressed within the central nervous system (CNS). While the pathogenic dysfunction of this protein has been extensively studied in the context of Alzheimer's disease, its normal function is poorly understood, and reports have often appeared contradictory. In this study we have examined the role of APP in regulating neurogenesis in the adult mouse brain by comparing neural stem cell proliferation, as well as new neuron number and morphology between APP knockout mice and C57bl6 controls. Short-term EdU administration revealed that the number of proliferating EdU+ neural progenitor cells and the number of PSA-NCAM+ neuroblasts produced in the SVZ and dentate gyrus were not affected by the life-long absence of APP. However, by labelling newborn cells with EdU and then following their fate over-time, we determined that ~48% more newly generated EdU+ NeuN+ neurons accumulated in the granule cell layer of the olfactory bulb and ~57% more in the dentate gyrus of young adult APP knockout mice relative to C57bl6 controls. Furthermore, proportionally fewer of the adult-born olfactory bulb granule neurons were calretinin+. To determine whether APP was having an effect on neuronal maturation, we administered tamoxifen to young adult Nestin-CreERT2::Rosa26-YFP and Nestin-CreERT2::Rosa26-YFP::APP-knockout mice, fluorescently labelling ~80% of newborn (EdU+) NeuN+ dentate granule neurons formed between P75 and P105. Our analysis of their morphology revealed that neurons added to the hippocampus of APP knockout mice have shorter dendritic arbors and only half the number of branch points as those generated in C57bl6 mice. We conclude that APP reduces the survival of newborn neurons in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus, but that it does not influence all neuronal subtypes equally. Additionally, APP influences dentate granule neuron maturation, acting as a robust regulator of dendritic extension and arborisation.",

    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease, soluble tau accumulates and deposits as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). However, a precise toxic mechanism of tau is not well understood. We hypothesized that overexpression of wild-type tau downregulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophic peptide essential for learning and memory. Two transgenic mouse models of human tau expression and human tau (hTau40)-transfected human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells were used to examine the effect of excess or pathologically modified wild-type human tau on BDNF expression. Both transgenic mouse models, with or without NFTs, as well as hTau40-SH-SY5Y cells significantly downregulated BDNF messenger RNA compared with controls. Similarly, transgenic mice overexpressing amyloid-beta (Abeta) significantly downregulated BDNF expression. However, when crossed with tau knockout mice, the resulting animals exhibited BDNF levels that were not statistically different from wild-type mice. These results demonstrate that excess or pathologically modified wild-type human tau downregulates BDNF and that neither a mutation in tau nor the presence of NFTs is required for toxicity. Moreover, our findings suggest that tau at least partially mediates Abeta-induced BDNF downregulation. Therefore, Alzheimer's disease treatments targeting Abeta alone may not be effective without considering the impact of tau pathology on neurotrophic pathways.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Currently available drugs against Alzheimer's disease (AD) target cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmissions without affecting the underlying disease process. Putative disease-modifying drugs are in development and target beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide and tau protein, the principal neurophatological hallmarks of the disease. Areas covered: Phase III clinical studies of emerging anti-Abeta drugs for the treatment of AD were searched in US and EU clinical trial registries and in the medical literature until May 2016. Expert opinion: Drugs in Phase III clinical development for AD include one inhibitor of the beta-secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) (verubecestat), three anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab, and aducanumab), an inhibitor of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) (azeliragon) and the combination of cromolyn sodium and ibuprofen (ALZT-OP1). These drugs are mainly being tested in subjects during early phases of AD or in subjects at preclinical stage of familial AD or even in asymptomatic subjects at high risk of developing AD. The hope is to intervene in the disease process when it is not too late. However, previous clinical failures with anti-Abeta drugs and the lack of fully understanding of the pathophysiological role of Abeta in the development of AD, put the new drugs at substantial risk of failure.",

    "title": "Genetic Restoration of Plasma ApoE Improves Cognition and Partially Restores Synaptic Defects in ApoE-Deficient Mice.",
    "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in individuals over the age of 65 years. The most prevalent genetic risk factor for AD is the epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (ApoE4), and novel AD treatments that target ApoE are being considered. One unresolved question in ApoE biology is whether ApoE is necessary for healthy brain function. ApoE knock-out (KO) mice have synaptic loss and cognitive dysfunction; however, these findings are complicated by the fact that ApoE knock-out mice have highly elevated plasma lipid levels, which may independently affect brain function. To bypass the effect of ApoE loss on plasma lipids, we generated a novel mouse model that expresses ApoE normally in peripheral tissues, but has severely reduced ApoE in the brain, allowing us to study brain ApoE loss in the context of a normal plasma lipid profile. We found that these brain ApoE knock-out (bEKO) mice had synaptic loss and dysfunction similar to that of ApoE KO mice; however, the bEKO mice did not have the learning and memory impairment observed in ApoE KO mice. Moreover, we found that the memory deficit in the ApoE KO mice was specific to female mice and was fully rescued in female bEKO mice. Furthermore, while the AMPA/NMDA ratio was reduced in ApoE KO mice, it was unchanged in bEKO mice compared with controls. These findings suggest that plasma lipid levels can influence cognition and synaptic function independent of ApoE expression in the brain. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: One proposed treatment strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the reduction of ApoE, whose epsilon4 isoform is the most common genetic risk factor for the disease. A major concern of this strategy is that an animal model of ApoE deficiency, the ApoE knock-out (KO) mouse, has reduced synapses and cognitive impairment; however, these mice also develop dyslipidemia and severe atherosclerosis. Here, we have shown that genetic restoration of plasma ApoE to wild-type levels normalizes plasma lipids in ApoE KO mice. While this does not rescue synaptic loss, it does completely restore learning and memory in the mice, suggesting that both CNS and plasma ApoE are independent parameters that affect brain health.",

    "abstract": "beta-Site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) cleaves amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) at the bond between Met671 and Asp672 (beta-site) to generate the carboxyl-terminal fragment (CTFbeta/C99). BACE1 also cleaves APP at another bond between Thr681 and Gln682 (beta'-site), yielding CTFbeta'/C89. Cleavage of CTFbeta/C99 by gamma-secretase generates Abeta(1-XX), whereas cleavage of CTFbeta'/C89 generates Abeta(11-XX). Thus, beta'-site cleavage by BACE1 is amyloidolytic rather than amyloidogenic. beta' cleavage of mouse APP is more common than the corresponding cleavage of human APP. We found that the H684R substitution within human Abeta, which replaces the histidine in the human protein with the arginine found at the corresponding position in mouse, facilitated beta' cleavage irrespective of the species origin of BACE1, thereby significantly increasing the level of Abeta(11-XX) and decreasing the level of Abeta(1-XX). Thus, amino acid substitutions within the Abeta sequence influenced the selectivity of alternative beta- or beta'-site cleavage of APP by BACE1. In familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), the APP gene harbors pathogenic variations such as the Swedish (K670N/M671L), Leuven (E682K), and A673V mutations, all of which decrease Abeta(11-40) generation, whereas the protective Icelandic mutation (A673T) increases generation of Abeta(11-40). Thus, A673T promotes beta' cleavage of APP and protects subjects against AD. In addition, CTFbeta/C99 was cleaved by excess BACE1 activity to generate CTFbeta'/C89, followed by Abeta(11-40), even if APP harbored pathogenic mutations. The resultant Abeta(11-40) was more metabolically labile in vivo than Abeta(1-40). Our analysis suggests that some FAD mutations in APP are amyloidogenic and/or amyloidolytic via selection of alternative BACE1 cleavage sites.",

    "abstract": "Hyperphosphorylated transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43, encoded by TARDBP ) proteinopathy has recently been described in ageing and in association with cognitive impairment, especially in the context of Alzheimer's disease pathology. To explore the role of mixed Alzheimer's disease and TDP-43 pathologies in clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia, we performed a comprehensive investigation of TDP-43, mixed pathologies, and clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia in a large cohort of community-dwelling older subjects. We tested the hypotheses that TDP-43 with Alzheimer's disease pathology is a common mixed pathology; is related to increased likelihood of expressing clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia; and that TDP-43 pathologic stage is an important determinant of clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia. Data came from 946 older adults with ( n = 398) and without dementia ( n = 548) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project and Religious Orders Study. TDP-43 proteinopathy (cytoplasmic inclusions) was present in 496 (52%) subjects, and the pattern of deposition was classified as stage 0 (none; 48%), stage 1 (amygdala; 18%), stage 2 (extension to hippocampus/entorhinal; 21%), or stage 3 (extension to neocortex; 14%). TDP-43 pathology combined with a pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was a common mixed pathology (37% of all participants), and the proportion of subjects with clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia formerly labelled 'pure pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease' was halved when TDP-43 was considered. In logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and education, TDP-43 pathology was associated with clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia (odds ratio = 1.51, 95% confidence interval = 1.11, 2.05) independent of pathological Alzheimer's disease (odds ratio = 4.30, 95% confidence interval = 3.08, 6.01) or other pathologies (infarcts, arteriolosclerosis, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis). Mixed Alzheimer's disease and TDP-43 pathologies were associated with higher odds of clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia (odds ratio = 6.73, 95% confidence interval = 4.18, 10.85) than pathologic Alzheimer's disease alone (odds ratio = 4.62, 95% confidence interval = 2.84, 7.52). In models examining TDP-43 stage, a dose-response relationship with clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia was observed, and a significant association was observed starting at stage 2, extension beyond the amygdala. In this large sample from almost 1000 community participants, we observed that TDP-43 proteinopathy was very common, frequently mixed with pathological Alzheimer's disease, and associated with a higher likelihood of the clinical expression of clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia but only when extended beyond the amygdala.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes are very serious diseases with the latter having been suggested to cause the former. We prepared super-hard rice bread blended with black rice bran (SRBBB), which contained a high amount of resistant starch that showed strong inhibitory activities against beta-secretase and acetylcholinesterase even after heating. Black rice bran showed greater beta-secretase inhibitory activity (3.6-fold) than Koshihikari rice. The bran contained more oleic acid and anthocyanin, meaning that it is potentially a biofunctional food with a high antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, aged mice, which were fed a SRBBB diet for four weeks, showed lower amyloid beta 40 peptide in the blood than mice fed a commercial diet (p < 0.01). Additionally, their initial blood glucose levels (BGLs) after 12 weeks of being fed SRBBB were significantly lower than those in the control group. Taken together, our results indicate SRBBB shows promise for inhibiting not only amyloid beta production, but also abrupt increases in postprandial BGLs.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Our goal was to develop cut points for amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, flouro-deoxyglucose (FDG) PET, and MRI cortical thickness. METHODS: We examined five methods for determining cut points. RESULTS: The reliable worsening method produced a cut point only for amyloid PET. The specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of cognitively impaired versus young clinically normal (CN) methods labeled the most people abnormal and all gave similar cut points for tau PET, FDG PET, and cortical thickness. Cut points defined using the accuracy of cognitively impaired versus age-matched CN method labeled fewer people abnormal. DISCUSSION: In the future, we will use a single cut point for amyloid PET (standardized uptake value ratio, 1.42; centiloid, 19) based on the reliable worsening cut point method. We will base lenient cut points for tau PET, FDG PET, and cortical thickness on the accuracy of cognitively impaired versus young CN method and base conservative cut points on the accuracy of cognitively impaired versus age-matched CN method.",

    "abstract": "A predictive coarse-grained protein force field [associative memory, water-mediated, structure, and energy model for molecular dynamics (AWSEM)-MD] is used to study the energy landscapes and relative stabilities of amyloid-beta protein (1-40) in the monomer and all of its oligomeric forms up to an octamer. We find that an isolated monomer is mainly disordered with a short alpha-helix formed at the central hydrophobic core region (L17-D23). A less stable hairpin structure, however, becomes increasingly more stable in oligomers, where hydrogen bonds can form between neighboring monomers. We explore the structure and stability of both prefibrillar oligomers that consist of mainly antiparallel beta-sheets and fibrillar oligomers with only parallel beta-sheets. Prefibrillar oligomers are polymorphic but typically take on a cylindrin-like shape composed of mostly antiparallel beta-strands. At the concentration of the simulation, the aggregation free energy landscape is nearly downhill. We use umbrella sampling along a structural progress coordinate for interconversion between prefibrillar and fibrillar forms to identify a conversion pathway between these forms. The fibrillar oligomer only becomes favored over its prefibrillar counterpart in the pentamer where an interconversion bottleneck appears. The structural characterization of the pathway along with statistical mechanical perturbation theory allow us to evaluate the effects of concentration on the free energy landscape of aggregation as well as the effects of the Dutch and Arctic mutations associated with early onset of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most devastating diseases for the older population, has become a major healthcare burden in the increasingly aging society worldwide. Currently, there are still only symptomatic treatments available on the market, just to slow down disease progression. In the past decades, extensive research focusing on the development of immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as potential \"disease-modifying drugs\" has shown promise in inhibiting or clearing the formation of toxic amyloid-beta (Abeta) species, the suspected causative agents of AD. As a result, these potential life-saving drugs can break the amyloid cascade, cease neurodegeneration, and prevent further reduction in cognitive and physical function. In this review, we first describe the polymorphisms of Abeta species, comprising three different pools, including monomers, soluble oligomers, and insoluble fibrils, with each pool encompassing multiple structures of Abeta aggregation. A comprehensive review on their toxicities follows in relation to the characterized epitopes of anti-Abeta mAb candidates under development. We then present the outcomes of these mAbs in clinical or pre-clinical trials and conclude by providing a summary of other novel and promising antibody-based immunotherapeutic approaches that deserve more attention for the effective treatment of AD in the future.",

    "abstract": "In testing the hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology in late stage traumatic brain injury (TBI), we evaluated AD pathological markers in late stage TBI model. Sprague-Dawley male rats were subjected to moderate controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury, and 6 months later euthanized and brain tissues harvested. Results from H&E staining revealed significant 33% and 10% reduction in the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampal CA3 interneurons, increased MHCII-activated inflammatory cells in many gray matter (8-20-fold increase) and white matter (6-30-fold increased) regions of both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, decreased cell cycle regulating protein marker by 1.6- and 1-fold in the SVZ and a 2.3- and 1.5-fold reductions in the ipsilateral and contralateral dentate gyrus, diminution of immature neuronal marker by two- and onefold in both the ipsilateral and contralateral SVZ and dentate gyrus, and amplified amyloid precursor protein (APP) distribution volumes in white matter including corpus callosum, fornix, and internal capsule (4-38-fold increase), as well as in the cortical gray matter, such as the striatum hilus, SVZ, and dentate gyrus (6-40-fold increase) in TBI animals compared to controls (P's < 0.001). Surrogate AD-like phenotypic markers revealed a significant accumulation of phosphorylated tau (AT8) and oligomeric tau (T22) within the neuronal cell bodies in ipsilateral and contralateral cortex, and dentate gyrus relative to sham control, further supporting the rampant neurodegenerative pathology in TBI secondary cell death. These findings indicate that AD-like pathological features may prove to be valuable markers and therapeutic targets for late stage TBI. J. Cell.

The nucleation phase in a nucleation-dependent aggregation model of Abeta42 is related to the formation of oligomers. Uncaria rhynchophylla is one component of \"Yokukansan\", a Kampo medicine, which is widely used for treating AD symptoms. Previously, an extract of U. rhynchophylla was found to reduce the aggregation of Abeta42, but its active principles have yet to be identified. In the present work, uncarinic acid C (3) was identified as an inhibitor of Abeta42 aggregation that is present in U. rhynchophylla. Moreover, compound 3 acted as a specific inhibitor of the nucleation phase of Abeta42 aggregation. Compound 3 was synthesized from saponin A (10), an abundant byproduct of rutin purified from Uncaria elliptica. Comprehensive structure-activity studies on 3 suggest that both a C-27 ferulate and a C-28 carboxylic acid group are required for its inhibitory activity. These findings may aid the development of oligomer-specific inhibitors for AD therapy.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) and its aggregation forms in the brain have been suggested as key targets for the therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the development of nanocarriers that possess both blood-brain barrier permeability and Abeta-targeting ability is of great importance for the intervention of AD. Here we constructed a biomimetic nanocarrier named apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-reconstituted high density lipoprotein nanocarrier (ANC) from recombinant ApoE and synthetic lipids to achieve the above goals. alpha-Mangostin (alpha-M), a polyphenolic agent that can inhibit the formation of Abeta oligomers and fibrils and accelerate Abeta cellular degradation, was used as the model drug. Compared with the control liposome, ANC demonstrated about 54-fold higher cellular uptake in brain endothelial cell line in vitro in an ApoE-dependent manner and much higher brain delivery efficiency in vivo. Confocal microscopy analysis witnessed the penetration of ANC across the brain vessels and its accumulation at the surrounding of Abeta aggregates. Following the loading of alpha-M, the Abeta-binding affinity of the nanoformulation (ANC-alpha-M) was not reduced but even enhanced. The effect of ANC-alpha-M on facilitating the microglia-mediated uptake and degradation of Abeta1-42 was enhanced by 336% and 29-fold when compared with that of the nontreated control and also much higher than that of ANC. Following intravenous administration for 2 to 4 weeks, ANC-alpha-M exhibited the most efficient efficacy in decreasing amyloid deposition, attenuating microgliosis, and rescuing memory defect in SAMP8 mice, an AD mouse model. Taken together, the findings of this work provided strong evidence that the ApoE-based biomimetic nanocarrier could provide a promising platform for brain drug delivery toward the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Experimental and clinical observations indicate that amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) peptide not only represents a major actor in neurodegenerative mechanisms but also induce hyperexcitation in individual neurons and neural circuits. In this abnormal excitability, possibly leading to seizures, the D1 dopamine (DA) receptors may play a role. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of Abeta1-42 were measured in patients with late-onset epilepsy of unknown etiology. Moreover, the effect of amyloid peptide on the hippocampal epileptic threshold and synaptic plasticity and its link to D1 receptor function were tested in experimental mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis and in acute model of Abeta1-42-induced neurotoxicity. Among 272 evaluated epileptic patients, aged >55 years, 35 suffered from late-onset epilepsy of unknown etiology. In these subjects, cerebrospinal fluid Abeta1-42 levels were measured. The effects of Abeta1-42, amyloid oligomers, and D1 receptor modulation on epileptic threshold were analyzed by electrophysiological recordings in the dentate gyrus of mice hippocampal slices. We found that Abeta1-42 levels were significantly decreased in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with late-onset epilepsy of unknown etiology with respect to controls suggesting the cerebral deposition of this peptide in these patients. Abeta1-42 enhanced epileptic activity in mice through a mechanism involving increased surface expression of D1 receptor, and this effect was mimicked by D1 receptor stimulation and blocked by SCH 23390, a D1 receptor antagonist. Abeta1-42 may contribute to the pathophysiology of late-onset epilepsy of unknown origin. Our preclinical findings indicate that the D1 receptor is involved in mediating the epileptic effects of Abeta1-42. This novel link between Abeta1-42 and D1 receptor signaling might represent a potential therapeutic target.",

A growing body of evidence indicates a potential protective effect of BDNF against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in AD mouse models. However, the direct therapeutic effect of BDNF supplement on tauopathy in AD remains to be established. Here, we found that the BDNF level was reduced in the serum and brain of AD patients and P301L transgenic mice (a mouse model of tauopathy). Intralateral ventricle injection of adeno-associated virus carrying the gene encoding human BDNF (AAV-BDNF) achieved stable expression of BDNF gene and restored the BDNF level in the brains of P301L mice. Restoration of the BDNF level attenuated behavioral deficits, prevented neuron loss, alleviated synaptic degeneration and reduced neuronal abnormality, but did not affect tau hyperphosphorylation level in the brains of P301L mice. Long-term expression of AAV-BDNF in the brain was well tolerated by the mice. These findings suggest that the gene delivery of BDNF is a promising treatment for tau-related neurodegeneration for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders with tauopathy.",

Within EPAD, the monitoring of cognitive trajectories in the preclinical period will constitute a central outcome measure; however, there are currently no clear guidelines as to how this should be achieved as most measures have been developed for the period around dementia diagnosis. The EPAD Scientific Advisory Group for Clinical and Cognitive Outcomes identified appropriate cognitive measures based on a literature search covering both cognitive correlates of preclinical brain changes from imaging studies and cognitive changes observed over time in nondementia population cohorts developing incident dementia. These measures were evaluated according to the following criteria: validity, coherence with biomarker changes, psychometric properties, cross-cultural suitability, availability of alternative forms, and normative data limited practice effects. The resulting consensus statement provides recommendations for both future drug trials and research into preclinical Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "We used a data-driven Bayesian model to automatically identify distinct latent factors of overlapping atrophy patterns from voxelwise structural MRIs of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia patients. Our approach estimated the extent to which multiple distinct atrophy patterns were expressed within each participant rather than assuming that each participant expressed a single atrophy factor. The model revealed a temporal atrophy factor (medial temporal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala), a subcortical atrophy factor (striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum), and a cortical atrophy factor (frontal, parietal, lateral temporal, and lateral occipital cortices). To explore the influence of each factor in early AD, atrophy factor compositions were inferred in beta-amyloid-positive (Abeta+) mild cognitively impaired (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN) participants. All three factors were associated with memory decline across the entire clinical spectrum, whereas the cortical factor was associated with executive function decline in Abeta+ MCI participants and AD dementia patients. Direct comparison between factors revealed that the temporal factor showed the strongest association with memory, whereas the cortical factor showed the strongest association with executive function. The subcortical factor was associated with the slowest decline for both memory and executive function compared with temporal and cortical factors. These results suggest that distinct patterns of atrophy influence decline across different cognitive domains. Quantification of this heterogeneity may enable the computation of individual-level predictions relevant for disease monitoring and customized therapies. Factor compositions of participants and code used in this article are publicly available for future research.",

    "title": "Copper Coordination Features of Human Islet Amyloid Polypeptide: The Type 2 Diabetes Peptide.",
    "abstract": "Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is the major component of amyloid deposits found in pancreatic beta-cells of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Copper ions have an inhibitory effect on the amyloid aggregation of hIAPP, and they may play a role in the etiology of T2D. However, deeper knowledge of the structural details of the copper-hIAPP interaction is required to understand the molecular mechanisms involved. Here, we performed a spectroscopic study of Cu(II) binding to hIAPP and several variants, using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electronic absorption, and circular dichroism (CD) in the UV-vis region in combination with Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) and density functional theory geometry optimizations. We find that Cu(II) binds to the imidazole N1 of His18, the deprotonated amides of Ser19 and Ser20, and an oxygen-based ligand provided by Ser20, either via its hydroxyl group or its backbone carbonyl, while Asn22 might also play a role as an axial ligand. Ser20 plays a crucial role in stabilizing Cu(II) coordination toward the C-terminal, providing a potential link between the S20G mutation associated with early onset of T2D, its impact in Cu binding properties, and hIAPP amyloid aggregation. Our study defines the nature of the coordination environment in the Cu(II)-hIAPP complex, revealing that the amino acid residues involved in metal ion binding are also key residues for the formation of beta-sheet structures and amyloid fibrils. Cu(II) binding to hIAPP may lead to the coexistence of more than one coordination mode, which in turn could favor different sets of Cu-induced conformational ensembles. Cu-induced hIAPP conformers would display a higher energetic barrier to form amyloid fibrils, hence explaining the inhibitory effect of Cu ions in hIAPP aggregation. Overall, this study provides further structural insights into the bioinorganic chemistry of T2D.",

Experiments in AD mouse models have shown that soluble oligomeric clusters of Abeta degrade synapses and impair memory formation. We show that all Abeta-driven effects measured in these mice depend on AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA3. Hippocampal neurons that lack GluA3 were resistant against Abeta-mediated synaptic depression and spine loss. In addition, Abeta oligomers blocked long-term synaptic potentiation only in neurons that expressed GluA3. Furthermore, although Abeta-overproducing mice showed significant memory impairment, memories in GluA3-deficient congenics remained unaffected. These experiments indicate that the presence of GluA3-containing AMPARs is critical for Abeta-mediated synaptic and cognitive deficits.",

    "title": "Characteristics of C-terminal, beta-amyloid peptide binding fragment of neuroprotective protease inhibitor, cystatin C.",
    "abstract": "Cystatin C originally identified as a cysteine proteases inhibitor has a broad spectrum of biological roles ranging from inhibition of extracellular cysteine protease activities, bone resorption, and modulation of inflammatory responses to stimulation of fibroblasts proliferation. There is an increasing number of evidence to suggest that human cystatin C (hCC) might play a protective role in the pathophysiology of sporadic Alzheimer's disease. In vivo and in vitro results well documented the association of hCC with Abeta and the hCC-induced inhibition of Abeta fibril formation. In our earlier work, using a combination of selective proteolytic methods and MS spectroscopy, C-terminal fragment hCC(101-117) was identified as the Abeta-binding region. The fragment of Abeta peptide responsible for the complex formation with hCC was found in the middle, highly hydrophobic part, Abeta(17-24). Structures and affinities of both Abeta and hCC binding sites were characterized by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like assay, by surface plasmon resonance, and by nano-ESI-FTICR MS of the hCC-Abeta-binding peptide complexes. In the in vitro inhibition studies, the binding cystatin sequence, hCC(101-117), revealed the highest relative inhibitory effect toward Abeta-fibril formation. Herein, we present further studies on molecular details of the hCC-Abeta complex. With Ala substitution, affinity experiments, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like assays for the Abeta-binding fragment, hCC(101-117), and its variants, the importance of individual amino acid residues for the protein interaction was evaluated. The results were analyzed using hCC(101-117) nuclear magnetic resonance structural data with molecular dynamics calculations and molecular modeling of the complexes. The results point to conformational requirements and special importance of some amino acid residues for the protein interaction. The obtained results might be helpful for the design of low molecular compounds modulating the biological role of both proteins. Copyright   2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Despite a key role of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), mechanisms that link Abeta plaques to tau neurofibrillary tangles and cognitive decline still remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to quantify proteins in the sarkosyl-insoluble brain proteome correlated with Abeta and tau insolubility in the asymptomatic phase of AD (AsymAD) and through mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and symptomatic AD. Employing label-free mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we quantified 2711 sarkosyl-insoluble proteins across the prefrontal cortex from 35 individual cases representing control, AsymAD, MCI and AD. Significant enrichment of Abeta and tau in AD was observed, which correlated with neuropathological measurements of plaque and tau tangle density, respectively. Pairwise correlation coefficients were also determined for all quantified proteins to Abeta and tau, across the 35 cases. Notably, six of the ten most correlated proteins to Abeta were U1 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (U1 snRNPs). Three of these U1 snRNPs (U1A, SmD and U1-70K) also correlated with tau consistent with their association with tangle pathology in AD. Thus, proteins that cross-correlate with both Abeta and tau, including specific U1 snRNPs, may have potential mechanistic roles in linking Abeta plaques to tau tangle pathology during AD progression.",

Their autophagy activity and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability were also assessed. The new derivatives exhibited high AChE inhibitory activity in vivo and in intro. Over half the derivatives exhibited a significant in vitro inhibitory activity toward the self-induced Abeta aggregation. While, treatment of SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing the Swedish mutant form of human beta-amyloid precursor protein (APPsw) with derivatives was associated with significant reduction of Abeta secretion levels. Moreover, one-third of the synthetic compounds were predicted to be able to cross the BBB to reach their targets in the central nervous system (CNS) according to a parallel artificial membrane permeation assay for BBB. Compounds 5b and 6b were chosen for assessing their autophagy activity. The fluorescence intensity of the BC12921 was decreased significantly after treatment with compounds.

    "abstract": "The complexity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) calls for search of multifunctional compounds as potential candidates for effective therapy. A series of phthalimide and saccharin derivatives linked by different alicyclic fragments (piperazine, hexahydropyrimidine, 3-aminopyrrolidine or 3-aminopiperidine) with phenylalkyl moieties attached have been designed, synthesized, and evaluated as multifunctional anti-AD agents with cholinesterase, beta-secretase and beta-amyloid inhibitory activities. In vitro studies showed that the majority of saccharin derivatives with piperazine moiety and one phthalimide derivative with 3-aminopiperidine fragment exhibited inhibitory potency toward acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with EeAChE IC50 values ranging from 0.83 muM to 19.18 muM. The target compounds displayed inhibition of human beta-secretase-1 (hBACE1) ranging from 26.71% to 61.42% at 50 muM concentration. Among these compounds, two multifunctional agents (26, [2-(2-(4-benzylpiperazin-1-yl)ethyl)benzo[d]isothiazol-3(2H)-one 1,1-dioxide] and 52, 2-(2-(3-(3,5-difluorobenzylamino)piperidin-1-yl)ethyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione) have been identified. Compound 26 exhibited the highest inhibitory potency against EeAChE (IC50 = 0.83 muM) and inhibitory activity against hBACE1 (33.61% at 50 muM). Compound 52 is a selective AChE inhibitor (IC50 AChE = 6.47 muM) with BACE1 inhibitory activity (26.3% at 50 muM) and it displays the most significant Abeta anti-aggregating properties among all the obtained compounds (39% at 10 muM).

    "title": "A Novel Way of Amelioration of Amyloid Beta Induced Toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With an incidence of 1 in 85 persons above the age of 60 years succumbing to the disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been predicted to create havoc globally. In spite of enormous efforts and exhaustive research, no cure is in sight. Hence, it is critical to unravel the mechanism of AD development/protection and identification of a cure soon. PURPOSE: This study is aimed at investigating the mechanism of reserpine action, which alleviates the toxicity of amyloid beta (Abeta) (AD-causing peptide) in Caenorhabditis elegans [1, 2]. METHODS: Determination of alleviation of Abeta toxicity with reserpine manifested as reduction in progressive paralysis, in the background of GFP reporter driven by the promoter of the FMRFamide neuropeptide, FLP-11 (AD; Pflp-11::GFP) and acetylcholine contribution through aldicarb (which inhibits acetylcholine esterase) treatment. RESULTS: The most significant protection against Abeta toxicity was obtained in the background of Pflp-11::GFP. This protection had 2 components. The promoter of FLP-11 with the reporter GFP, Pflp-11::GFP, per se gave significant protection. Further reserpine treatment provided additional alleviation. Together they could almost eliminate Abeta toxicity. These 2 components of Abeta toxicity alleviation are dependent on acetylcholine levels, as an increase in acetylcholine by aldicarb treatment reduces the protective effect. CONCLUSION: A unique way to alleviate Abeta toxicity is reserpine treatment in combination with Pflp-11::GFP. Reserpine should be evaluated as a potential drug in a pilot study in AD patients. Furthermore, identification of the mechanism of Pflp-11::GFP-mediated reduction in Abeta toxicity is a potential pathway to develop therapeutics for AD.",

The development of a sensitive and reliable method for monitoring the Abeta oligomer levels in body fluids is an urgent requirement in order to predict the severity and progression at early or preclinical stages of AD. Here, we show a proof of concept for a sensitive and specific detection of Abeta oligomers by an antibody-aptamer sandwich assay. The antibodies of Abeta oligomers and a nanocomposite of gold nanoparticles with aptamer and thionine (aptamer-Au-Th) were used as the recognition element and the detection probe for specifically binding to Abeta oligomers, respectively. The electrochemical signal of Th reduction could provide measurable electrochemical signals, and a low limit of detection (100 pM) was achieved due to the signal amplification by high loading of Th on the gold nanoparticles. The feasibility of the assay was verified by test of Abeta oligomers in artificial cerebrospinal fluid. The proposed strategy presents valuable information related to early diagnosis of AD process.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are characterized by accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) at the cerebrovasculature due to decreased clearance at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, the exact mechanism of Abeta clearance across this barrier has not been fully elucidated. The hCMEC/D3 cell line has been characterized as a valid model for the BBB. In this study we evaluated the use of this model to study Abeta clearance across the BBB, with an emphasis on brain-to-blood directional permeability. Barrier integrity of hCMEC/D3 monolayers was confirmed for large molecules in both the apical to basolateral and the reverse direction. However, permeability for smaller molecules was substantially higher, especially in basolateral to apical direction, and barrier formation for Abeta was completely absent in this direction. In addition, hCMEC/D3 cells failed to develop a high TEER, possibly caused by incomplete formation of tight junctions. We conclude that the hCMEC/D3 model has several limitations to study the cerebral clearance of Abeta. Therefore, the model needs further characterization before this cell system can be generally applied as a model to study cerebral Abeta clearance.   2016 The Authors Journal of Neuroscience Research Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Several structurally distinct BACE1 inhibitors have been withdrawn from development after inducing ocular toxicity in animal models, but the target mediating this toxicity has not been identified. Here we use a clickable photoaffinity probe to identify cathepsin D (CatD) as a principal off-target of BACE1 inhibitors in human cells. We find that several BACE1 inhibitors blocked CatD activity in cells with much greater potency than that displayed in cell-free assays with purified protein. Through a series of exploratory toxicology studies, we show that quantifying CatD target engagement in cells with the probe is predictive of ocular toxicity in vivo. Taken together, our findings designate off-target inhibition of CatD as a principal driver of ocular toxicity for BACE1 inhibitors and more generally underscore the power of chemical proteomics for discerning mechanisms of drug action.",

    "abstract": "A common property of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), harboring mutations associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a high propensity to misfold and form abnormal aggregates. The aggregation of mutant SOD1 has been demonstrated in vitro, with purified proteins, in mouse models, in human tissues, and in cultured cell models. In vitro translation studies have determined that SOD1 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mutations is slower to mature, and thus perhaps vulnerable to off-pathway folding that could generate aggregates. The aggregation of mutant SOD1 in living cells can be monitored by tagging the protein with fluorescent fluorophores. In this study, we have taken advantage of the Dendra2 fluorophore technology in which excitation can be used to switch the output color from green to red, thereby clearly creating a time stamp that distinguishes pre-existing and newly made proteins. In cells that transiently over-express the Ala 4 to Val variant of SOD1-Dendra2, we observed that newly made mutant SOD1 was rapidly captured by pathologic intracellular inclusions. In cell models of mutant SOD1 aggregation over-expressing untagged A4V-SOD1, we observed that immature forms of the protein, lacking a Cu co-factor and a normal intramolecular disulfide, persist for extended periods. Our findings fit with a model in which immature forms of mutant A4V-SOD1, including newly made protein, are prone to misfolding and aggregation.",

Analysis of neurons carrying fAD PS1 or APP mutations introduced using genome editing technology at the endogenous loci revealed that fAD mutant neurons had previously unreported defects in the recycling state of endocytosis and soma-to-axon transcytosis of APP and lipoproteins. The endocytosis reduction could be rescued through treatment with a beta-secretase inhibitor. Our data suggest that accumulation of beta-CTFs of APP, but not Abeta, slow vesicle formation from an endocytic recycling compartment marked by the transcytotic GTPase Rab11. We confirm previous results that endocytosis is affected in AD and extend these to uncover a neuron-specific defect. Decreased lipoprotein endocytosis and transcytosis to the axon suggest that a neuron-specific impairment in endocytic axonal delivery of lipoproteins and other key materials might compromise synaptic maintenance in fAD.",

AChE and Abeta42 levels in the hippocampus were determined by ELISA. p-Akt, p-mTOR, and LC3B expression were detected by flow cytometry. The expression of p-Akt, p-mTOR, Beclin-1, and p62 proteins was assessed by western blot. Changes in autophagy were viewed using a transmission electron microscope. APP and Beclin-1 mRNA levels were measured by Real-Time PCR. The learning and memory of APP/PS1 transgenic mice were improved significantly after beta-asarone treatment compared with the untreated group. In addition, beta-asarone treatment reduced AChE and Abeta42 levels, increased p-mTOR and p62 expression, decreased p-Akt, Beclin-1, and LC3B expression, decreased the number of autophagosomes and reduced APP mRNA and Beclin-1 mRNA levels compared with the untreated group. That is, beta-asarone treatment can improve the learning and memory abilities of APP/PS1 transgenic mouse by inhibiting Beclin-1-dependent autophagy via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.",

METHODS: Cross-sectional data were analyzed from 423 older adults from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle study. Analyses of covariance evaluated associations between Abeta, APOE and BDNF genotype, and cortisol in relation to severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Among Abeta+ older adults, APOE epsilon4 carriage was associated with greater severity of anxiety symptoms (d = 0.55); and in the full sample, APOE epsilon4 carriage was linked to greater severity of depressive (d = 0.26) and anxiety (d = 0.21) symptoms. Among Abeta+ women, epsilon4 carriers reported greater anxiety symptoms than non-epsilon4 carriers (d = 0.83), and female BDNF rs6265 Val66 Met allele carriers reported greater depressive symptoms (d = 0.29). CONCLUSION: Sex moderated the relationship between Abeta, APOE genotype, and BDNF genotype in predicting severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms in cognitively normal older adults.",

Carriers of APOE-e4 with normal cognition had higher cortical Abeta-plaque-load than non-carriers. In MCI an association between APOE-e4 and higher Abeta-plaque-load was observable both for cortical and subcortical brain-regions. APOE-e4 and MCI was also associated with higher cortical iron. Moreover, cerebral iron significantly affected functional coupling, and was furthermore associated with increased Abeta-plaque-load (R2-adjusted = 0.80, p < 0.001) and APOE-e4 carrier status (p < 0.001) in MCI. This study confirms earlier reports on an association between increased brain iron-burden and risk for neurocognitive dysfunction due to AD, and indicates that disease-progression is conferred by spatial colocalization of brain iron deposits with Abeta-plaques.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence of aggregates of amyloid beta (Abeta) in senile plaques and tau in neurofibrillary tangles, as well as marked neuron and synapse loss. Of these pathological changes, synapse loss correlates most strongly with cognitive decline. Synapse loss occurs prominently around plaques due to accumulations of oligomeric Abeta. Recent evidence suggests that tau may also play a role in synapse loss but the interactions of Abeta and tau in synapse loss remain to be determined. In this study, we generated a novel transgenic mouse line, the APP/PS1/rTg21221 line, by crossing APP/PS1 mice, which develop Abeta-plaques and synapse loss, with rTg21221 mice, which overexpress wild-type human tau. When compared to the APP/PS1 mice without human tau, the cross-sectional area of ThioS+ dense core plaques was increased by ~50%. Along with increased plaque size, we observed an increase in plaque-associated dystrophic neurites containing misfolded tau, but there was no exacerbation of neurite curvature or local neuron loss around plaques. Array tomography analysis similarly revealed no worsening of synapse loss around plaques, and no change in the accumulation of Abeta at synapses. Together, these results indicate that adding human wild-type tau exacerbates plaque pathology and neurite deformation but does not exacerbate plaque-associated synapse loss.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation and aggregation of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. There has been increased interest in finding new anti-amyloidogenic compounds to inhibit Abeta aggregation. Herein, thioflavin T fluorescent assay and transmission electron microscopy results showed that hematoxylin, a natural organic molecule extracted from Caesalpinia sappan, was a powerful inhibitor of Abeta42 fibrillogenesis. Circular dichroism studies revealed hematoxylin reduced the beta-sheet content of Abeta42 and made it assemble into antiparallel arrangement, which induced Abeta42 to form off-pathway aggregates. As a result, hematoxylin greatly alleviated Abeta42-induced cytotoxicity. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed the detailed interactions between hematoxylin and Abeta42. Four binding sites of hematoxylin on Abeta42 hexamer were identified, including the N-terminal region, S8GY10 region, turn region, and C-terminal region. Notably, abundant hydroxyl groups made hematoxylin prefer to interact with Abeta42 via hydrogen bonds. This also contributed to the formation of pi-pi stacking and hydrophobic interactions. Taken together, the research proved that hematoxylin was a potential agent against Abeta fibrillogenesis and cytotoxicity.",

We previously reported an age-related increase of tau protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of amyloid beta (Abeta) precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. METHODS: APP transgenic mice were treated with a potent BACE1 inhibitor. CSF tau and CSF Abeta levels were assessed. A novel high-sensitivity tau sandwich immunoassay was developed. RESULTS: We demonstrate that long-term BACE1 inhibition prevents CSF tau increase both in early-depositing APP transgenic mice and APP transgenic mice with moderate Abeta pathology. DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrate that BACE1 inhibition not only reduces Abeta generation but also downstream AD pathophysiology. The tight correlation between Abeta aggregation in brain and CSF tau levels renders CSF tau a valuable marker to predict the effectiveness of BACE1 inhibitors in current clinical trials.",

    "title": "The Alzheimer's-related amyloid beta peptide is internalised by R28 neuroretinal cells and disrupts the microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP-2).",
    "abstract": "Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a common, irreversible blinding condition that leads to the loss of central vision. AMD has a complex aetiology with both genetic as well as environmental risks factors, and share many similarities with Alzheimer's disease. Recent findings have contributed significantly to unravelling its genetic architecture that is yet to be matched by molecular insights. Studies are made more challenging by observations that aged and AMD retinas accumulate the highly pathogenic Alzheimer's-related Amyloid beta (Abeta) group of peptides, for which there appears to be no clear genetic basis. Analyses of human donor and animal eyes have identified retinal Abeta aggregates in retinal ganglion cells (RGC), the inner nuclear layer, photoreceptors as well as the retinal pigment epithelium. Abeta is also a major drusen constituent; found correlated with elevated drusen-load and age, with a propensity to aggregate in retinas of advanced AMD. Despite this evidence, how such a potent driver of neurodegeneration might impair the neuroretina remains incompletely understood, and studies into this important aspect of retinopathy remains limited. In order to address this we exploited R28 rat retinal cells which due to its heterogeneous nature, offers diverse neuroretinal cell-types in which to study the molecular pathology of Abeta. R28 cells are also unaffected by problems associated with the commonly used RGC-5 immortalised cell-line, thus providing a well-established model in which to study dynamic Abeta effects at single-cell resolution. Our findings show that R28 cells express key neuronal markers calbindin, protein kinase C and the microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP-2) by confocal immunofluorescence which has not been shown before, but also calretinin which has not been reported previously. For the first time, we reveal that retinal neurons rapidly internalised Abeta1-42, the most cytotoxic and aggregate-prone amongst the Abeta family. Furthermore, exposure to physiological amounts of Abeta1-42 for 24 h correlated with impairment to neuronal MAP-2, a cytoskeletal protein which regulates microtubule dynamics in axons and dendrites. Disruption to MAP-2 was transient, and had recovered by 48 h, although internalised Abeta persisted as discrete puncta for as long as 72 h. To assess whether Abeta could realistically localise to living retinas to mediate such effects, we subretinally injected nanomolar levels of oligomeric Abeta1-42 into wildtype mice. Confocal microscopy revealed the presence of focal Abeta deposits in RGC, the inner nuclear and the outer plexiform layers 8 days later, recapitulating naturally-occurring patterns of Abeta aggregation in aged retinas. Our novel findings describe how retinal neurons internalise Abeta to transiently impair MAP-2 in a hitherto unreported manner. MAP-2 dysfunction is reported in AMD retinas, and is thought to be involved in remodelling and plasticity of post-mitotic neurons. Our insights suggest a molecular pathway by which this could occur in the senescent eye leading to complex diseases such as AMD.",

    "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Kai Xin San (KXS), a traditional formula of Chinese medicine, has been used to treat dementia. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study aimed to investigate its ameliorating effects on Abeta1-40-induced cognitive impairment in rats using a series of novel reward-directed instrumental learning tasks, and to determine its possible mechanism of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were pretreated with KXS aqueous extract (0.72 and 1.44g/kg, p.o.) for 10 days, and were trained to gain reward reinforcement by lever pressing at the meantime. Thereafter, rats received a bilateral microinjection of Abeta1-40 in CA1 regions of the hippocampus. Cognitive performance was evaluated with the goal directed (higher response ratio) and habit (visual signal discrimination and extinction) learning tasks, as well as on the levels of memory-related biochemical parameters and molecules. RESULTS: Our findings first demonstrated that KXS can improve Abeta1-40-induced amnesia in RDIL via enhancing the comprehension of action-outcome association and the utilization of cue information to guide behavior. Then, its ameliorating effects should be attributed to the modulation of memory-related molecules in the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, KXS has the potential to prevent and/or delay the deterioration of cognitive impairment in AD.",

    "abstract": "Soluble oligomers of amyloid-beta (Abeta) impair synaptic plasticity, perturb neuronal energy homeostasis, and are implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Therefore, significant efforts in AD drug discovery research aim to prevent the formation of Abeta oligomers or block their neurotoxicity. The eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF2K) plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity, and couples neurotransmission to local dendritic mRNA translation. Recent evidence indicates that Abeta oligomers activate neuronal eEF2K, suggesting a potential link to Abeta induced synaptic dysfunction. However, a detailed understanding of the role of eEF2K in AD pathogenesis, and therapeutic potential of eEF2K inhibition in AD, remain to be determined. Here, we show that eEF2K activity is increased in postmortem AD patient cortex and hippocampus, and in the hippocampus of aged transgenic AD mice. Furthermore, eEF2K inhibition using pharmacological or genetic approaches prevented the toxic effects of Abeta42 oligomers on neuronal viability and dendrite formation in vitro. We also report that eEF2K inhibition promotes the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF2) antioxidant response in neuronal cells, which was crucial for the beneficial effects of eEF2K inhibition in neurons exposed to Abeta42 oligomers. Accordingly, NRF2 knockdown or overexpression of the NRF2 inhibitor, Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein-1 (Keap1), significantly attenuated the neuroprotection associated with eEF2K inhibition. Finally, genetic deletion of the eEF2K ortholog efk-1 reduced oxidative stress, and improved chemotaxis and serotonin sensitivity in C. elegans expressing human Abeta42 in neurons. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential utility of eEF2K inhibition to reduce Abeta-mediated oxidative stress in AD.",

Blood biomarkers of AD neuropathology would be valuable, as non-AD intellectual disabilities of DS and AD dementia overlap clinically. We hypothesized that elevations of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides and phosphorylated-tau in neuronal exosomes may document preclinical AD. METHODS: AD neuropathogenic proteins Abeta1-42, P-T181-tau, and P-S396-tau were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in extracts of neuronal exosomes purified from blood of individuals with DS and age-matched controls. RESULTS: Neuronal exosome levels of Abeta1-42, P-T181-tau, and P-S396-tau were significantly elevated in individuals with DS compared with age-matched controls at all ages beginning in childhood. No significant gender differences were observed. DISCUSSION: These early increases in Abeta1-42, P-T181-tau, and P-S396-tau in individuals with DS may provide a basis for early intervention as targeted treatments become available.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms involved in Alzheimer's disease are not completely understood and how astrocytes and their gliotransmission contribute to this neurodegenerative disease remains to be fully elucidated. Previous studies have shown that amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) induces neuronal death by a mechanism that involves the excitotoxic release of ATP and glutamate associated to astroglial hemichannel opening. We have demonstrated that synthetic and endogenous cannabinoids (CBs) reduce the opening of astrocyte Cx43 hemichannels evoked by activated microglia or inflammatory mediators. Nevertheless, whether CBs could prevent the astroglial hemichannel-dependent death of neurons evoked by Abeta is unknown. Astrocytes as well as acute hippocampal slices were treated with the active fragment of Abeta alone or in combination with the following CBs: WIN, 2-AG, or methanandamide (Meth). Hemichannel activity was monitored by single channel recordings and by time-lapse ethidium uptake while neuronal death was assessed by Fluoro-Jade C staining. We report that CBs fully prevented the hemichannel activity and inflammatory profile evoked by Abeta in astrocytes. Moreover, CBs fully abolished the Abeta-induced release of excitotoxic glutamate and ATP associated to astrocyte Cx43 hemichannel activity, as well as neuronal damage in hippocampal slices exposed to Abeta. Consequently, this work opens novel avenues for alternative treatments that target astrocytes to maintain neuronal function and survival during AD. GLIA 2016 GLIA 2017;65:122-137.",

BIN1-amphiphysin2 is the second most prevalent genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. In diseased brains, the BIN1-amphiphysin2 neuronal isoform is downregulated. Here, we show that lowering BIN1-amphiphysin2 levels in neurons promotes Tau pathology propagation whereas overexpression of neuronal BIN1-amphiphysin2 inhibits the process in two in vitro models. Increased Tau propagation is caused by increased endocytosis, given our finding that BIN1-amphiphysin2 negatively regulates endocytic flux. Furthermore, blocking endocytosis by inhibiting dynamin also reduces Tau pathology propagation. Using a galectin-3-binding assay, we show that internalized Tau aggregates damage the endosomal membrane, allowing internalized aggregates to leak into the cytoplasm to propagate pathology. Our work indicates that lower BIN1 levels promote the propagation of Tau pathology by efficiently increasing aggregate internalization by endocytosis and endosomal trafficking.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Amyloid hypothesis states that endogenous beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta), especially its aggregated oligomers and fibrils are the key pathogenic factors leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, inhibition of Abeta fibrillation rather than blocking its production is considered promising therapeutic intervention. Hence, the present study was carried out to assess the effect of methanolic leaf extract of R. mucronata (MERM) and its bioactive compound catechin on in vitro fibrillation of Abeta (25-35). METHODOLOGY: Antiaggregation and disaggregation effect by MERM and (+)- catechin against Abeta (25-35) were assessed in three different phases by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay and confocal microscopic analysis. The conformational changes in the aggregated Abeta fibrils in the presence and absence of MERM and catechin were analysed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and CD spectroscopy. RESULTS: Results of ThT and confocal microscopic studies showed decrease in fluorescence intensity in MERM and catechin-treated groups illustrating that both MERM and catechin effectively inhibited fibril aggregation as well as destabilized preformed Abeta fibril. TEM revealed that MERM incubated samples were virtually devoid of structured fibrils but had an amorphous-like consistency, whereas the control contained structured fibrils of various width and length. FTIR analysis showed decrease in absorbance at 1630 cm-1 (amide I region) in MERM-treated groups substantiating the results of ThT assay. Circular dichroism data indicate that catechin prevents the formation of beta-structured aggregates of Abeta peptide. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that MERM and catechin might have direct interaction with Abeta peptide preventing its fibrillation.",

    "abstract": "Post-mortem investigations of human Alzheimer's disease (AD) have largely failed to provide unequivocal evidence in support of the original amyloid cascade hypothesis, which postulated deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregates to be the cause of a demented state as well as inductive to tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Conflicting evidence suggests, however, that Abeta plaques and NFTs, albeit to a lesser extent, are present in a substantial subset of non-demented individuals. Hence, a range of soluble tau and Abeta species has more recently been implicated as the disease-relevant toxic entities. Despite the incorporation of soluble proteins into a revised amyloid cascade hypothesis, a detailed characterization of these species in the context of human AD onset, progression and cognitive decline has been lacking. Here, lateral temporal lobe samples (Brodmann area 21) of 46 human cases were profiled via tau and Abeta Western blot and native state dot blot protocols. Elevations in phospho-tau (antibodies: CP13, AT8 and PHF-1), pathological tau conformations (MC-1) and oligomeric tau (TOC1) agreed with medical diagnosis (non-AD cf. AD) and Braak stage classification (low, intermediate and high), alongside elevations in soluble Abeta species (MOAB-2 and pyro-glu Abeta) and a decline in levels of the amyloid precursor protein. Strong correlations were observed between individual Braak stages and multiple cognitive measures with all tau markers as well as total soluble Abeta. In contrast to previous reports, SDS-stable Abeta oligomers (*56) were not found to be reliable for all classifications and appeared likely to be a technical artefact. Critically, the robust predictive value of total soluble Abeta was dependent on native state quantification. Elevations in tau and Abeta within soluble fractions (Braak stage 2-3 cf. 0) were evident earlier than previously established in fibril-focused disease progression scales. Together, these data provide strong evidence that soluble forms of tau and Abeta co-localise early in AD and are closely linked to disease progression and cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disorder that gradually destroys memory and cognitive abilities in the elderly, makes a huge emotional and economic burden on the patients and their families. The presence of senile plaques and the loss of cholinergic neurons in the brain are two neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Maternal separation (MS) is an animal paradigm designed to make early life stress. Studies on wild type rodents showed that MS could induce AD-like cognitive deficit and pathological changes. However, the effects of MS on AD susceptible population or AD animal models are still unclear. In the present study, male APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice were separated from dam and pups 3h per day from postnatal day 2 to day 21. After weaning, all animals were housed under normal conditions (4 mice per cage). At 9-month age, MWM tests were performed to evaluate the learning and memory abilities. Then the pathological changes in the brain were measured by histology staining. The results showed MS mice had more severe deficit of learning and memory. Compared to the control, there were more senile plaques in cortex and hippocampus, fewer cholinergic neurons in nucleus basalis of Meynert in MS mice. These results indicate that MS exacerbates Alzheimer's disease-like behavioral and pathological changes in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.",

Although it has been frequently proposed that the deposition of Abeta in the walls of cortical vessels directly causes microhemorrhages, this has not been studied in great detail, mainly because the ruptured vessels are often missed on routine histopathologic examination. Here, we examined histopathological data from studies targeting microhemorrhages with high-resolution ex vivo 7 T MRI in nine cases with moderate-to-severe CAA, and assessed the presence of Abeta in the walls of involved vessels. We also assessed the density of Abeta positive cortical vessels in areas surrounding microhemorrhages compared to control areas. In seven out of 19 microhemorrhages, the presumed involved vessel could be identified on the histopathological section. Only one of these vessels was positive for Abeta at the site of rupture. Moreover, the density of Abeta positive cortical vessels was lower (1.0 per mm2) within a range of 315 microm surrounding the microhemorrhage, compared to control areas (2.0 per mm2; p < 0.05). These findings question the widely held assumption that the deposition of Abeta in the walls of cortical vessels directly causes microhemorrhages.",

    "abstract": "Beta-amyloid (Abeta) immunotherapy is a promising intervention to slow Alzheimer's disease. Aging dogs naturally accumulate Abeta and show cognitive decline. An active vaccine against fibrillar Abeta 1-42 (VAC) in aged beagles resulted in maintenance but not improvement of cognition along with reduced brain Abeta. Behavioral enrichment (ENR) led to cognitive benefits but no reduction in Abeta. We hypothesized cognitive outcomes could be improved by combining VAC with ENR in aged dogs. Aged dogs (11-12 years) were placed into 4 groups: (1) control/control (C/C); (2) control/VAC (C/V); (3) ENR/control (E/C); and (4) ENR/VAC (E/V) and treated for 20 months. VAC decreased brain Abeta, pyroglutamate Abeta, increased cerebrospinal fluid Abeta 42 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor RNA levels but also increased microhemorrhages. ENR reduced brain Abeta and prevented microhemorrhages. The combination treatment resulted in a significant maintenance of learning over time, reduced Abeta, and increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA despite increased microhemorrhages; however, there were no benefits to memory. These results suggest that the combination of immunotherapy with behavioral enrichment leads to cognitive maintenance associated with reduced neuropathology that may benefit people with Alzheimer's disease.",

Hence, drugs enhancing insulin signaling may have therapeutic potential for AD. Lixisenatide, a novel long-lasting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogue, facilitates insulin signaling and has neuroprotective properties. We previously reported the protective effects of lixisenatide on memory formation and synaptic plasticity. Here, we describe additional key neuroprotective properties of lixisenatide and its possible molecular and cellular mechanisms against AD-related impairments in rats. The results show that lixisenatide effectively alleviated amyloid beta protein (Abeta) 25-35-induced working memory impairment, reversed Abeta25-35-triggered cytotoxicity on hippocampal cell cultures, and prevented against Abeta25-35-induced suppression of the Akt-MEK1/2 signaling pathway.

These results further confirmed the neuroprotective and cytoprotective action of lixisenatide against Abeta-induced impairments, suggesting that the protective effects of lixisenatide may involve the activation of the Akt-MEK1/2 signaling pathway and the regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Recent data suggest that intraneuronal accumulation of metabolites of the amyloid-beta-precursor protein (APP) is neurotoxic. We observed that transgenic mice overexpressing in neurons a human APP gene harboring the APPE693Q (Dutch) mutation have intraneuronal lysosomal accumulation of APP carboxylterminal fragments (APP-CTFs) and oligomeric amyloid beta (oAbeta) but no histological evidence of amyloid deposition. Morphometric quantification using the lysosomal marker protein 2 (LAMP-2) immunolabeling showed higher neuronal lysosomal counts in brain of 12-months-old APPE693Q as compared with age-matched non-transgenic littermates, and western blots showed increased lysosomal proteins including LAMP-2, cathepsin D and LC3. At 24 months of age, these mice also exhibited an accumulation of alpha-synuclein in the brain, along with increased conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, an autophagosomal/autolysosomal marker. In addition to lysosomal changes at 12 months of age, these mice developed cholinergic neuronal loss in the basal forebrain, GABAergic neuronal loss in the cortex, hippocampus and basal forebrain and gliosis and microgliosis in the hippocampus. These findings suggest a role for the intraneuronal accumulation of oAbeta and APP-CTFs and resultant lysosomal pathology at early stages of Alzheimer's disease-related pathology.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and the most frequent cause of dementia in the aged population. According to the amyloid hypothesis, the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AD. Abeta is generated from the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein and can aggregate to form oligomers, which have been described as a major synaptotoxic agent in neurons. Dysfunction of Wnt signaling has been linked to increased Abeta formation; however, several other studies have argued against this possibility. Herein, we use multiple experimental approaches to confirm that the inhibition of Wnt signaling promoted the amyloidogenic proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein. We also demonstrate that inhibiting Wnt signaling increases the production of the Abeta42 peptide, the Abeta42 /Abeta40 ratio, and the levels of Abeta oligomers such as trimers and tetramers. Moreover, we show that activating Wnt signaling reduces the levels of Abeta42 and its aggregates, increases Abeta40 levels, and reduces the Abeta42 /Abeta40 ratio. Finally, we show that the protective effects observed in response to activation of the Wnt pathway rely on beta-catenin-dependent transcription, which is demonstrated experimentally via the expression of various 'mutant forms of beta-catenin'. Together, our findings indicate that loss of the Wnt signaling pathway may contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.",

Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and confocal images indicate that Abeta forms a very large aggregate in bulk and more efficiently, in the bilayer region of the liposome, respectively. The aggregates formed inside the liposome gradually migrate out to bulk water. FRET, from HiLyte Fluor 488 (covalently attached to an Abeta peptide) to TRITC (tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate) covalently attached to a DHPE lipid present in the bilayer, reveals intermittent oscillations in the time scale of ~0.5 s. This is attributed to the structural fluctuations of the membrane of the liposome. The solvation dynamics of Abeta in monomer and in oligomeric state is studied by monitoring the emission of HiLyte Fluor 488. The solvation dynamics of the Abeta monomer is similar to that of oligomeric aggregates in the liposome.",

Our previous studies indicated that the sequence 31-35 in Abeta molecule is an effective active center responsible for Abeta neurotoxicity in vivo and in vitro. In the present study, we prepared a novel antibody specifically targeting the sequence 31-35 of amyloid beta protein, and investigated the neuroprotection of the anti-Abeta31-35 antibody against Abeta1-42 -induced impairments in neuronal viability, spatial memory, and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in rats. The results showed that the anti-Abeta31-35 antibody almost equally bound to both Abeta31-35 and Abeta1-42 , and pretreatment with the antibody dose-dependently prevented Abeta1-42 -induced cytotoxicity on cultured primary cortical neurons. In behavioral study, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of anti-Abeta31-35 antibody efficiently attenuated Abeta1-42 -induced impairments in spatial learning and memory of rats. In vivo electrophysiological experiments further indicated that Abeta1-42 -induced suppression of hippocampal synaptic plasticity was effectively reversed by the antibody. These results demonstrated that the sequence 31-35 of Abeta may be a new therapeutic target, and the anti-Abeta31-35 antibody could be a novel immunotheraputic approach for the treatment of AD.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Strategies that can restore or improve the clearance function hold great promise in delaying or preventing the onset of AD. Here, we show that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), by use of fat-1 transgenic mice and oral administration of fish oil, significantly promote interstitial Abeta clearance from the brain and resist Abeta injury. Such beneficial effects were abolished in Aqp4-knockout mice, suggesting that the AQP4-dependent glymphatic system is actively involved in the promoting the effects of n-3 PUFAs on the clearance of extracellular Abeta. Imaging on clarified brain tissues clearly displayed that n-3 PUFAs markedly inhibit the activation of astrocytes and protect the AQP4 polarization in the affected brain region after Abeta injection. The results of the present study prove a novel mechanism by which n-3 PUFAs exert protective roles in reducing Abeta accumulation via mediating the glymphatic system function.-Ren, H., Luo, C., Feng, Y., Yao, X., Shi, Z., Liang, F., Kang, J.

    "title": "Universality in human cortical folding in health and disease.",
    "abstract": "The folding of the cortex in mammalian brains across species has recently been shown to follow a universal scaling law that can be derived from a simple physics model. However, it was yet to be determined whether this law also applies to the morphological diversity of different individuals in a single species, in particular with respect to factors, such as age, sex, and disease. To this end, we derived and investigated the cortical morphology from magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of over 1,000 healthy human subjects from three independent public databases. Our results show that all three MRI datasets follow the scaling law obtained from the comparative neuroanatomical data, which strengthens the case for the existence of a common mechanism for cortical folding. Additionally, for comparable age groups, both male and female brains scale in exactly the same way, despite systematic differences in size and folding. Furthermore, age introduces a systematic shift in the offset of the scaling law. In the model, this shift can be interpreted as changes in the mechanical forces acting on the cortex. We also applied this analysis to a dataset derived from comparable cohorts of Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy subjects of similar age. We show a systematically lower offset and a possible change in the exponent for Alzheimer's disease subjects compared with the control cohort. Finally, we discuss implications of the changes in offset and exponent in the data and relate it to existing literature. We, thus, provide a possible mechanistic link between previously independent observations.",

    "abstract": "Citrullination and deamidation, which are aging-related posttranslational modifications, increase the number of negative charges on amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) at neutral pH. We investigated the effects of these modifications on the fibrillation properties of Abeta. The Arg5 Cit modification of Abeta1-40 did not affect the fibrillation rate, and brought beta-sheet structures unlike that in the Abeta1-40 fibril. The Asn27 Asp modification of Abeta1-40 stopped the fibrillation and induced the formation of aggregates that involved an anti-parallel beta-sheet. Abeta1-42 with the Arg5 Cit modification showed increased solubility in aqueous media, and its fibril formation became slower than that of Abeta1-42. The modification did not change the parallel beta-sheet structure of the fibrils. Abeta1-42 with the Asn27 Asp modification partially formed fibrils that involved the parallel beta-sheet structure. Using the thioflavin T (ThT) assay, an increased fraction of the soluble oligomer of each Abeta analog was transiently detected during fibrillation. An increase in the number of negative charges at basic pH affected the aggregation properties of Abeta in a manner different from that with the modifications, suggesting that change in properties of the posttanslationally modified residues rather than the number of charges in the peptide was important.",

    "abstract": "The risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly dependent on apolipoprotein-E (apoE) genotype. The reasons for apoE isoform-selective risk are uncertain; however, both the amounts and structure of human apoE isoforms have been hypothesized to lead to amyloidosis increasing the risk for AD. To address the hypothesis that amounts of apoE isoforms are different in the human CNS, we developed a novel isoform-specific method to accurately quantify apoE isoforms in clinically relevant samples. The method utilizes an antibody-free enrichment step and isotope-labeled physiologically relevant lipoprotein particle standards produced by immortalized astrocytes. We applied this method to a cohort of well characterized clinical samples and observed the following findings. The apoE isoform amounts are not different in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from young normal controls, suggesting that the amount of apoE isoforms is not the reason for risk of amyloidosis prior to the onset of advanced age. We did, however, observe an age-related increase in both apoE isoforms. In contrast to normal aging, the presence of amyloid increased apoE3, whereas apoE4 was unchanged or decreased. Importantly, for heterozygotes, the apoE4/apoE3 isoform ratio was increased in the CNS, although the reverse was true in the periphery. Finally, CSF apoE levels, but not plasma apoE levels, correlated with CSF beta-amyloid levels. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that CNS and peripheral apoE are separate pools and differentially regulated. Furthermore, these results suggest that apoE mechanisms for the risk of amyloidosis and AD are related to an interaction between apoE, aging, and the amount of amyloid burden.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether concomitant Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, reflected by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, has an impact on dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in terms of clinical presentation, cognitive decline, nursing home admittance and survival. PARTICIPANTS: We selected 111 patients with probable DLB and CSF available from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. On the basis of the AD biomarker profile (CSF tau/amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta42) ratio >0.52), we divided patients into a DLB/AD+ and DLB/AD- group. Of the 111 patients, 42 (38%) had an AD CSF biomarker profile. We investigated differences between groups in memory, attention, executive functions, language and visuospatial functions. Difference in global cognitive decline (repeated Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)) was investigated using linear mixed models. Cox proportional hazard analyses were used to investigate the effects of the AD biomarker profile on time to nursing home admittance and time to death. RESULTS: Memory performance was worse in DLB/AD+ patients compared with DLB/AD- patients (p<0.01), also after correction for age and sex. Hallucinations were more frequent in DLB/AD+ (OR=3.34, 95% CI 1.22-9.18). There was no significant difference in the rate of cognitive decline. DLB/AD+ patients had a higher mortality risk (HR=3.13, 95% CI 1.57 to 6.24) and nursing home admittance risk (HR=11.70, 95% CI 3.74 to 36.55) compared with DLB/AD- patients. CONCLUSIONS: DLB-patients with a CSF AD profile have a more severe manifestation of the disease and a higher risk of institutionalisation and mortality. In clinical practice, CSF biomarkers may aid in predicting prognosis in DLB. In addition, DLB-patients with positive AD biomarkers could benefit from future treatment targeting AD pathology.",

Given that a combination of different therapeutic strategies often provides more rapid and effective outcomes in diverse areas of clinical treatment, we hypothesized that administration of anti-amyloid drugs with cognitive enhancers would result in synergistic effects in AD treatment. Here, we co-administered 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropane-sulphonic acid (EPPS), an amyloid-clearing chemical, and donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, to determine whether they could serve complementary roles for each other in regards to AD treatment. We found that oral administration of these two molecules led to a rapid and consistent cognitive improvement in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Although there was no evidence for synergistic effects, our results indicated that EPPS and donepezil function complementary to each other without altering their individual effects. Thus, the combined use of disease-modifying and symptomatic relief drugs may be a promising approach in the treatment of AD.",

Employing AD homogenates, [18F]-9, a PET tracer demonstrates superior (2-10 fold higher) binding affinity than approved FDA tracers, while also indicating binding to high affinity site on Abeta plaques. Pharmacokinetic studies indicate high initial influx of [18F]-9 in normal mice brains accompanied by rapid clearance in the absence of targeted plaques. Following incubation in human serum, [18F]-9 indicates presence of parental compound up to 3h thus indicating its stability. Furthermore, in vitro autoradiography studies of [18F]-9 with AD brain tissue sections and ex vivo autoradiography studies in transgenic mouse brain sections show cortical Abeta binding, and a fair correlation with Abeta immunostaining. Finally, multiphoton- and microPET/CT imaging indicate its ability to penetrate brain and label parenchymal plaques in transgenic mice. Following further validation of its performance in other AD rodent models and nonhuman primates, Fluselenamyl could offer a platform technology for monitoring earliest stages of Abeta pathophysiology in vivo.",

    "title": "Association of Higher Cortical Amyloid Burden With Loneliness in Cognitively Normal Older Adults.",
    "abstract": "Importance: Emotional and behavioral symptoms in cognitively normal older people may be direct manifestations of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathophysiology at the preclinical stage, prior to the onset of mild cognitive impairment. Loneliness is a perceived state of social and emotional isolation that has been associated with cognitive and functional decline and an increased risk of incident AD dementia. We hypothesized that loneliness might occur in association with elevated cortical amyloid burden, an in vivo research biomarker of AD. Objective: To determine whether cortical amyloid burden is associated with greater loneliness in cognitively normal older adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional analyses using data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study of 79 cognitively normal, community-dwelling participants. A continuous, aggregate measure of cortical amyloid burden, determined by Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomography (PiB-PET), was examined in association with loneliness in linear regression models adjusting for age, sex, apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOEepsilon4), socioeconomic status, depression, anxiety, and social network (without and with the interaction of amyloid and APOEepsilon4). We also quantified the association of high amyloid burden (amyloid-positive group) to loneliness (lonely group) using logistic regression, controlling for the same covariates, with the amyloid-positive group and the lonely group, each composing 32% of the sample (n = 25). Main Outcomes and Measures: Loneliness, as determined by the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale (possible range, 3-12, with higher score indicating greater loneliness). Results: The 79 participants included 43 women and 36 men with a mean (SD) age of 76.4 (6.2) years. Mean (SD) cortical amyloid burden via PiB-PET was 1.230 (0.209), and the mean (SD) UCLA-3 loneliness score was 5.3 (1.8). Twenty-two (28%) had positive APOEepsilon4 carrier status, and 25 (32%) were in the amyloid-positive group with cortical PiB distribution volume ratio greater than 1.2. Controlling for age, sex, APOEepsilon4, socioeconomic status, depression, anxiety, and social network, we found that higher amyloid burden was significantly associated with greater loneliness: compared with individuals in the amyloid-negative group, those in the amyloid-positive group were 7.5-fold (95% CI, 1.7-fold to 34.0-fold) more likely to be classified as lonely than nonlonely (beta = 3.3, partial r = 0.4, P = .002). Furthermore, the association of high amyloid burden and loneliness was stronger in APOEepsilon4 carriers than in noncarriers. Conclusions and Relevance: We report a novel association of loneliness with cortical amyloid burden in cognitively normal older adults, suggesting that loneliness is a neuropsychiatric symptom relevant to preclinical AD. This work will inform new research into the neural underpinnings and disease mechanisms involved in loneliness and may enhance early detection and intervention research in AD.",

After determining the nucleation size and subsequent stable protofibrillar structure from the CG model, validated with all-atom simulations, we consider the \"lock and dock\" and \"activated monomer\" fibril elongation mechanisms for the protofibril by statistical additions of a monomer drawn from four different ensembles of the free Abeta40 peptide to grow the fibril. Our CG model shows that the dominant mechanism for fibril elongation is the lock and dock mechanism across all monomer ensembles, even when the monomer is in the activated form. Although our CG model finds no thermodynamic difference between the two fibril elongation mechanisms, the activated monomer is found to be kinetically faster by a factor of 2 for the \"locking\" step compared with all other structured or unstructured monomer ensembles.",

    "abstract": "beta-Amyloid (Abeta) peptides are thought to be critically involved in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aspartyl protease beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is required for the production of Abeta, and BACE1 inhibition is thus an attractive target for the treatment of AD. We show that verubecestat (MK-8931) is a potent, selective, structurally unique BACE1 inhibitor that reduced plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain concentrations of Abeta40, Abeta42, and sAPPbeta (a direct product of BACE1 enzymatic activity) after acute and chronic administration to rats and monkeys. Chronic treatment of rats and monkeys with verubecestat achieved exposures >40-fold higher than those being tested in clinical trials in AD patients yet did not elicit many of the adverse effects previously attributed to BACE inhibition, such as reduced nerve myelination, neurodegeneration, altered glucose homeostasis, or hepatotoxicity. Fur hypopigmentation was observed in rabbits and mice but not in monkeys. Single and multiple doses were generally well tolerated and produced reductions in Abeta40, Abeta42, and sAPPbeta in the CSF of both healthy human subjects and AD patients. The human data were fit to an amyloid pathway model that provided insight into the Abeta pools affected by BACE1 inhibition and guided the choice of doses for subsequent clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are a type of glia from the mammalian olfactory system, with neuroprotective and regenerative properties. beta-Amyloid peptides are a major component of the senile plaques characteristic of the Alzheimer brain. The amyloid beta (Abeta) precursor protein is cleaved to amyloid peptides, and Abeta25-35 is regarded to be the functional domain of Abeta, responsible for its neurotoxic properties. It has been reported that Abeta25-35 triggers reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative damage, altering the structure and function of mitochondria, leading to the activation of the mitochondrial intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Our goal is to investigate the effects of OECs on the toxicity of aggregated Abeta25-35, in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. For such purpose, SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with Abeta25-35 and OEC-conditioned medium (OECCM). OECCM promoted the cell viability and reduced the apoptosis, and decreased the intracellular ROS and the lipid peroxidation. In the presence of OECCM, mRNA and protein levels of antioxidant enzymes (SOD1 and SOD2) were upregulated. Concomitantly, OECCM decreased mRNA and the protein expression levels of cytochrome c, caspase-9, caspase-3, and Bax in SH-SY5Y cells, and increased mRNA and the protein expression level of Bcl-2. However, OECCM did not alter intracellular Ca2+ concentration in SH-SY5Y cells. Taken together, our data suggest that OECCM ameliorates Abeta25-35-induced oxidative damage in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells by inhibiting the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway. These data provide new insights into the functional actions of OECCM on oxidative stress-induced cell damage.",

Cell culture and animal studies showed that tau fibrils can undergo cell-to-cell transmission and seed aggregation of soluble tau, but this phenomenon was only robustly demonstrated in models overexpressing tau. In this study, we found that intracerebral inoculation of tau fibrils purified from AD brains (AD-tau), but not synthetic tau fibrils, resulted in the formation of abundant tau inclusions in anatomically connected brain regions in nontransgenic mice. Recombinant human tau seeded by AD-tau revealed unique conformational features that are distinct from synthetic tau fibrils, which could underlie the differential potency in seeding physiological levels of tau to aggregate. Therefore, our study establishes a mouse model of sporadic tauopathies and points to important differences between tau fibrils that are generated artificially and authentic ones that develop in AD brains.",

    "title": "Immunotherapy with Aducanumab Restores Calcium Homeostasis in Tg2576 Mice.",
    "abstract": "Calcium homeostasis plays a major role in maintaining neuronal function under physiological conditions. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) initiates pathological processes that include disruption in intracellular calcium levels, so amelioration of the calcium alteration could serve as an indirect functional indicator of treatment efficacy. Therefore, calcium dynamics were used as a measure of functional outcome. We evaluated the effects of the anti-Abeta antibody aducanumab on calcium homeostasis and plaque clearance in aged Tg2576 mice with in vivo multiphoton imaging. Acute topical application of aducanumab to the brain resulted in clearance of amyloid plaques. Although chronic systemic administration of aducanumab in 22-month-old mice did not clear existing plaques, calcium overload was ameliorated over time. Therefore, this antibody likely restores neuronal network function that possibly underlies cognitive deficits, indicating promise as a clinical treatment. In addition, functional readouts such as calcium overload may be a more useful outcome measure to monitor treatment efficacy in models of Alzheimer's disease compared with amyloid burden alone. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is currently without a cure. Aducanumab is an anti-amyloid-beta antibody being developed for the treatment of AD. Interim analyses of a phase 1b clinical trial have suggested potential beneficial effects on amyloid pathology and cognitive status in patients treated with aducanumab (Sevigny et al., 2016). Here, we show that a murine analog of aducanumab clears amyloid plaques in an acute setting and restores calcium homeostasis disrupted in a mouse model of AD upon chronic treatment. Therefore, we demonstrate that aducanumab reverses a functional outcome measure reflective of neural network activity.",

    "abstract": "There is considerable debate whether Alzheimer's disease (AD) originates in basal forebrain or entorhinal cortex. Here we examined whether longitudinal decreases in basal forebrain and entorhinal cortex grey matter volume were interdependent and sequential. In a large cohort of age-matched older adults ranging from cognitively normal to AD, we demonstrate that basal forebrain volume predicts longitudinal entorhinal degeneration. Models of parallel degeneration or entorhinal origin received negligible support. We then integrated volumetric measures with an amyloid biomarker sensitive to pre-symptomatic AD pathology. Comparison between cognitively matched normal adult subgroups, delineated according to the amyloid biomarker, revealed abnormal degeneration in basal forebrain, but not entorhinal cortex. Abnormal degeneration in both basal forebrain and entorhinal cortex was only observed among prodromal (mildly amnestic) individuals. We provide evidence that basal forebrain pathology precedes and predicts both entorhinal pathology and memory impairment, challenging the widely held belief that AD has a cortical origin.",

    "abstract": "Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been proposed to be highly beneficial in Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD pathology is closely linked to an overproduction and accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides as extracellular senile plaques in the brain. Total Abeta levels are not only dependent on its production by proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), but also on Abeta-clearance mechanisms, including Abeta-degrading enzymes. Here we show that the omega-3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) increase Abeta-degradation by affecting insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), the major Abeta-degrading enzyme secreted into the extracellular space of neuronal and microglial cells. The identification of the molecular mechanisms revealed that EPA directly increases IDE enzyme activity and elevates gene expression of IDE. DHA also directly stimulates IDE enzyme activity and affects IDE sorting by increasing exosome release of IDE, resulting in enhanced Abeta-degradation in the extracellular milieu. Apart from the known positive effect of DHA in reducing Abeta production, EPA and DHA might ameliorate AD pathology by increasing Abeta turnover.",

Here we investigated the mechanism and antioxidative function of KHG26693 in the hippocampus of Abeta-treated mice. KHG26693 significantly attenuated Abeta-induced TNF-alpha and IL-1beta enhancements. KHG26693 decreased Abeta-mediated malondialdehyde formation, protein oxidation, and reactive oxygen species by decreasing the iNOS level. KHG26693 suppressed Abeta-induced oxidative stress through a mechanism involving glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and GSH attenuation. Abeta-induced MMP-2, cPLA2, and pcPLA2 expressions were almost completely attenuated by KHG26693 treatment, suggesting that Abeta-induced oxidative stress reduction by KHG26693 is, at least partly, caused by the downregulation of MMP-2 and cPLA2 activation. Compared with Abeta treatment, KHG26693 treatment upregulated Nrf2 and HO-1 expressions, suggesting that KHG26693 protects the brain from Abeta-induced oxidative damage, likely by maintaining redox balance through Nrf2/HO-1 pathway regulation.

    "abstract": "Prion diseases are associated with conversion of cellular prion protein (PrPC) into an abnormally folded and infectious scrapie isoform (PrPSc). We previously showed that peptides derived from the unprocessed N-termini of mouse and bovine prion proteins, mPrP1-28 and bPrP1-30, function as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), and destabilize model membrane systems, which could explain the infectivity and toxicity of prion diseases. However, subsequent studies revealed that treatment with mPrP1-28 or bPrP1-30 significantly reduce PrPSc levels in prion-infected cells. To explain these seemingly contradictory results, we correlated the aggregation, membrane perturbation and cytotoxicity of the peptides with their cellular uptake and intracellular localization. Although the peptides have a similar primary sequence, mPrP1-28 is amyloidogenic, whereas bPrP1-30 forms smaller oligomeric or non-fibrillar aggregates. Surprisingly, bPrP1-30 induces much higher cytotoxicity than mPrP1-28, indicating that amyloid formation and toxicity are independent. The toxicity is correlated with prolonged residence at the plasma membrane and membrane perturbation. Both ordered aggregation and toxicity of the peptides are inhibited by low pH. Under non-toxic conditions, the peptides are internalized by lipid-raft dependent macropinocytosis and localize to acidic lysosomal compartments. Our results shed light on the antiprion mechanism of the prion protein-derived CPPs and identify a potential site for PrPSc formation.",

    "abstract": "Despite existing knowledge about the role of the A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) as the alpha-secretase involved in the non-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch signalling we have only limited information about its regulation. In this study, we have identified ADAM10 interactors using a split ubiquitin yeast two hybrid approach. Tetraspanin 3 (Tspan3), which is highly expressed in the murine brain and elevated in brains of Alzheimer s disease (AD) patients, was identified and confirmed to bind ADAM10 by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in mammalian cells in complex with APP and the gamma-secretase protease presenilin. Tspan3 expression increased the cell surface levels of its interacting partners and was mainly localized in early and late endosomes. In contrast to the previously described ADAM10-binding tetraspanins, Tspan3 did not affect the endoplasmic reticulum to plasma membrane transport of ADAM10. Heterologous Tspan3 expression significantly increased the appearance of carboxy-terminal cleavage products of ADAM10 and APP, whereas N-cadherin ectodomain shedding appeared unaffected. Inhibiting the endocytosis of Tspan3 by mutating a critical cytoplasmic tyrosine-based internalization motif led to increased surface expression of APP and ADAM10. After its downregulation in neuroblastoma cells and in brains of Tspan3-deficient mice, ADAM10 and APP levels appeared unaltered possibly due to a compensatory increase in the expression of Tspans 5 and 7, respectively. In conclusion, our data suggest that Tspan3 acts in concert with other tetraspanins as a stabilizing factor of active ADAM10, APP and the gamma-secretase complex at the plasma membrane and within the endocytic pathway.",

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) has been reported to attenuate Abeta toxicity in neuronal cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective function of IGF-1 remain largely unknown. In the present study, we for the first time demonstrated that IGF-1 protects against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity via inhibition of PUMA expression and Bax activation. We found that IGF-1 could activate Akt, which in turn inhibited Abeta-induced FOXO3a nuclear translocation and thus decreased the binding ability of FOXO3a to PUMA promoter, leading to decreased PUMA expression. In addition, IGF-1 inhibited the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria induced by Abeta. Notably, addition of wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI3K, significantly abolished the neuroprotective effect of IGF-1, suggesting that IGF-1 exerts its anti-apoptotic effect depend on PI3K activity. Our findings may provide new insights into molecular mechanisms mediated by IGF-1 in cell survival against Abeta-induced apoptosis.",

    "title": "Glycation induces conformational changes in the amyloid-beta peptide and enhances its aggregation propensity: molecular insights.",
    "abstract": "The cytotoxicity of the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), can be enhanced by its post-translational glycation, a series of non-enzymatic reactions with reducing sugars and reactive dicarbonyls. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms that potentially enhance the cytotoxicity of the advanced glycation modified Abeta. In this work, fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are exploited to obtain direct molecular insights into the process of early Abeta self-assembly in the presence and absence of glycated lysine residues. Analyses of data exceeding cumulative timescales of 1 microsecond for each system reveal that glycation results in a stronger enthalpy of association between Abeta monomers and lower conformational entropy, in addition to a sharp overall increase in the beta-sheet content. Further analyses reveal that the enhanced interactions originate, in large part, due to markedly stronger, as well as new, inter-monomer salt bridging propensities in the glycated variety. Interestingly, these conformational and energetic effects are broadly reflected in preformed protofibrillar forms of Abeta small oligomers modified with glycation. Our combined results imply that glycation consolidates Abeta self-assembly regardless of its point of occurrence in the pathway. They provide a basis for further mechanistic studies and therapeutic endeavors that could potentially result in novel ways of combating AGE related AD progression.",

    "abstract": "There is an accumulation of evidence indicating that the risk of Alzheimer's disease is associated with diabetes mellitus, an indicator of high glucose concentrations in blood plasma. This study investigated the effect of high glucose on BACE1 expression and amyloidogenesis in vivo, and we present details of the mechanism associated with those effects. Our results, using ZLC and ZDF rat models, showed that ZDF rats have high levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta), phosphorylated tau, BACE1, and APP-C99. In vitro result with mouse hippocampal neuron and SK-N-MC, high glucose stimulated Abeta secretion and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, high glucose increased BACE1 and APP-C99 expressions, which were reversed by a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger. Indeed, high glucose increased intracellular ROS levels and HIF-1alpha expression, associated with regulation of BACE1 and Liver X Receptor alpha (LXRalpha). In addition, high glucose induced ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) down-regulation, was associated with LXR-induced lipid raft reorganization and BACE1 localization on the lipid raft. Furthermore, silencing of BACE1 expression was shown to regulate Abeta secretion and apoptosis of SK-N-MC. In conclusion, high glucose upregulates BACE1 expression and activity through HIF-1alpha and LXRalpha/ABCA1-regulated lipid raft reorganization, leading to Abeta production and apoptosis of SK-N-MC.",

    "abstract": "Objectives. To explore the alterations of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) in APP/PS1 mice after electroacupuncture (EA) treatment and further to explore the mechanism. Methods. Forty 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice were randomly divided into a model group and an EA group, with twenty wild-type mice used as a normal control group. Mice in the EA group were treated with EA at GV 20 (bai hui) and bilateral KI 1 (yong quan) acupoints for 6 weeks. The Morris water maze was applied to assess the spatial memory in behavior. Immunohistochemistry (IHC), ELISA, Western blotting, and so forth were used to observe the expression of LRP1 and Abeta. Results. The Morris water maze test showed that, compared with the normal control group, the model group's learning and memory capabilities were significantly decreased (P < 0.05; P < 0.01). The EA group was reversed (P < 0.05; P < 0.01). The hippocampal expression of Abeta in the EA group was significantly decreased compared to the model group (P < 0.01). The expression of LRP1 in the model group was significantly lower than that in the normal control group (P < 0.01); the expression in the EA group was significantly higher than that in the model group (P < 0.01). Conclusions. EA therapy can improve the learning and memory capabilities of APP/PS1 mice. The underlying mechanism may lie in the upregulation of an Abeta transport receptor and LRP1.",

Partly because of their planar structure several bis-styrylbenzenes have been previously reported as potential Abeta imaging agents. However, these compounds are relatively hydrophobic, which likely limits their in vivo potential. Based on their structures, we hypothesized that less hydrophobic bis-pyridylethenylbenzenes may also label amyloid. We synthesized several bis-pyridylethenylbenzenes and tested whether these compounds indeed display improved solubility and lower LogP values, and studied their fluorescent properties and Abeta binding characteristics. Bis-pyridylethenylbenzenes showed a clear affinity for Abeta plaques on both human and murine AD brain sections. Competitive binding experiments suggested a different binding site than Chrysamine G, a well-known stain for amyloid. With a LogP value between 3 and 5, most bis-pyridylethenylbenzenes were able to enter the brain and label murine amyloid in vivo with the bis(4-pyridylethenyl)benzenes showing the most favorable characteristics. In conclusion, the presented results suggest that bis-pyridylethenylbenzene may serve as a novel backbone for amyloid imaging agents.",

We aimed to provide an extensive characterization of the gene expression profiles of the amyloidosis APP23 model for AD and control mice and to evaluate the effect of aging on these profiles. We also correlated our findings to changes in soluble Abeta-levels and other pathological and symptomatic features of the model. We observed a clear biphasic expression profile. The first phase displayed a maturation profile, which resembled features found in young carriers of familial AD mutations. The second phase reflected aging processes and showed similarities to the progression of human AD pathology. During this phase, the model displayed a clear upregulation of microglial activation and lysosomal pathways and downregulation of neuron differentiation and axon guidance pathways. Interestingly, the changes in expression were all correlated to aging in general, but appeared more extensive/accelerated in APP23 mice.",

    "title": "Ginsenoside Re reduces Abeta production by activating PPARgamma to inhibit BACE1 in N2a/APP695 cells.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) deposition. Reducing the Abeta load may be a new perspective for AD treatment. Ginsenoside Re is an extract from Panax notoginseng, which is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine that has been used for the treatment of various diseases for years. Ginsenoside Re has been reported to decrease Abeta in Alzheimer's disease animal models, but the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of ginsenoside Re. Our results showed that ginsenoside Re decreased the Abeta levels in N2a/APP695 cells. Abeta peptides are generated by beta-secretase (beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)) and gamma-secretase. We found that ginsenoside Re decreased the BACE1 mRNA and protein levels and inhibited BACE1 activity in the N2a/APP695 cells. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) is a transcription factor that regulates the activity of the BACE1 promoter, and activating PPARgamma can inhibit BACE1. The results also showed that ginsenoside Re significantly increased the PPARgamma protein and mRNA levels. These effects of ginsenoside Re on BACE1 could be effectively inhibited by the PPARgamma antagonist GW9662. These findings indicate that ginsenoside Re inhibits BACE1 through activation of PPARgamma, which ultimately reduces the generation of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42. Therefore, ginsenoside Re may be a promising agent for the modulation of Abeta-related pathology in AD.",

    "title": "Probing oligomerization of amyloid beta peptide in silico.",
    "abstract": "Aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide is implicated in fatal Alzheimer's disease, for which no cure is available. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for this aggregation is required in order for therapies to be developed. In an effort to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in spontaneous aggregation of Abeta peptide, extensive molecular dynamics simulations are reported, and the results are analyzed through a combination of structural biology tools and a novel essential collective dynamics method. Several model systems composed of ten or twelve Abeta17-42 chains in water are investigated, and the influence of metal ions is probed. The results suggest that Abeta monomers tend to aggregate into stable globular-like oligomers with 13-23% of beta-sheet content. Two stages of oligomer formation have been identified: quick collapse within the first 40 ns of the simulation, characterized by a decrease in inter-chain separation and build-up of beta-sheets, and the subsequent slow relaxation of the oligomer structure. The resulting oligomers comprise a stable, coherently moving sub-aggregate of 6-9 strongly inter-correlated chains. Cu2+ and Fe2+ ions have been found to develop coordination bonds with carboxylate groups of E22, D23 and A42, which remain stable during 200 ns simulations. The presence of Fe2+, and particularly Cu2+ ions, in negatively charged cavities has been found to cause significant changes in the structure and dynamics of the oligomers. The results indicate, in particular, that formation of non-fibrillar oligomers might be involved in early template-free aggregation of Abeta17-42 monomers, with charged species such as Cu2+ or Fe2+ ions playing an important role.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is the major component of plaques found in Alzheimer's disease patients. Using solid-state 2H NMR relaxation performed on selectively deuterated methyl groups, we probed the dynamics in the threefold symmetric and twofold symmetric polymorphs of native Abeta as well as the protofibrils of the D23N mutant. Specifically, we investigated the methyl groups of two leucine residues that belong to the hydrophobic core (L17 and L34) as well as M35 residues belonging to the hydrophobic interface between the cross-beta subunits, which has been previously found to be water-accessible. Relaxation measurements performed over 310-140 K and two magnetic field strengths provide insights into conformational variability within and between polymorphs. Core packing variations within a single polymorph are similar to what is observed for globular proteins for the core residues, whereas M35 exhibits a larger degree of variability. M35 site is also shown to undergo a solvent-dependent dynamical transition in which slower amplitude motions of methyl axes are activated at high temperature. The motions, modeled as a diffusion of methyl axis, have activation energy by a factor of 2.7 larger in the twofold compared with the threefold polymorph, whereas D23N protofibrils display a value similar to the threefold polymorph. This suggests enhanced flexibility of the hydrophobic interface in the threefold polymorph. This difference is only observed in the hydrated state and is absent in the dry fibrils, highlighting the role of solvent at the cavity. In contrast, the dynamic behavior of the core is hydration-independent.",

    "title": "Amyloid-beta Peptide Nitrotyrosination Stabilizes Oligomers and Enhances NMDAR-Mediated Toxicity.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the pathological aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). Monomeric soluble Abeta can switch from helicoidal to beta-sheet conformation, promoting its assembly into oligomers and subsequently to amyloid fibrils. Oligomers are highly toxic to neurons and have been reported to induce synaptic transmission impairments. The progression from oligomers to fibrils forming senile plaques is currently considered a protective mechanism to avoid the presence of the highly toxic oligomers. Protein nitration is a frequent post-translational modification under AD nitrative stress conditions. Abeta can be nitrated at tyrosine 10 (Y10) by peroxynitrite. Based on our analysis of ThT binding, Western blot and electron and atomic force microscopy, we report that Abeta nitration stabilizes soluble, highly toxic oligomers and impairs the formation of fibrils. We propose a mechanism by which fibril elongation is interrupted upon Y10 nitration: Nitration disrupts fibril-forming folds by preventing H14-mediated bridging, as shown with an Abeta analog containing a single residue (H to E) replacement that mimics the behavior of nitrated Abeta related to fibril formation and neuronal toxicity. The pathophysiological role of our findings in AD was highlighted by the study of these nitrated oligomers on mouse hippocampal neurons, where an increased NMDAR-dependent toxicity of nitrated Abeta oligomers was observed. Our results show that Abeta nitrotyrosination is a post-translational modification that increases Abeta synaptotoxicity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: We report that nitration (i.e., the irreversible addition of a nitro group) of the Alzheimer-related peptide amyloid-beta (Abeta) favors the stabilization of highly toxic oligomers and inhibits the formation of Abeta fibrils. The nitrated Abeta oligomers are more toxic to neurons due to increased cytosolic calcium levels throughout their action on NMDA receptors. Sustained elevated calcium levels trigger excitotoxicity, a characteristic event in Alzheimer's disease.",

In this context, unravelling the molecular mechanisms controlling BACE1 expression and activity in both physiological and pathological conditions remains of major importance. We previously demonstrated that Abeta controlled BACE1 transcription in an NFkappaB-dependent manner. Here, we delineate an additional cellular pathway by which natural and synthetic Abeta42 oligomers enhance active X-box binding protein XBP-1s. XBP-1s lowers BACE1 expression and activity indirectly, via the up-regulation of the ubiquitin-ligase HRD1 that acts as an endogenous down-regulator of BACE1. Thus, we delineate a novel pathway by which cells could compensate for Abeta42 oligomers production and thus, associated toxicity, by triggering a compensatory mechanism aimed at lowering BACE-1-mediated Abeta production by a molecular cascade involving XBP-1s and HRD1. It thus identifies HRD1 as a potential target for a novel Abeta-centered therapeutic strategy.",

Whether a physical property of cells, such as stiffness, is altered by endogenously overexpressed Abeta has not yet been investigated. In this study, we used human neuroblastoma cells stably overexpressing amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its Swedish mutant form (APPswe) to measure the changes in cell stiffness. Our results showed that the stiffness of cells overexpressing APP or APPswe was higher than that of control SH-SY5Y cells. Either reducing levels of Abeta with the gamma secretase inhibitor DAPT or blocking the membrane calcium channel formed by Abeta with tromethamine decreased cell stiffness to a level close to the control SH-SY5Y cells. Our results suggested that Abeta, not APP, contributed to increased cell stiffness and that closure of calcium channels formed by Abeta can alleviate the effects of Abeta on membrane stiffness.",

In contrast, we found that, at least in early disease, site-specific phosphorylation of tau inhibited Abeta toxicity. This specific tau phosphorylation was mediated by the neuronal p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase p38gamma and interfered with postsynaptic excitotoxic signaling complexes engaged by Abeta. Accordingly, depletion of p38gamma exacerbated neuronal circuit aberrations, cognitive deficits, and premature lethality in a mouse model of AD, whereas increasing the activity of p38gamma abolished these deficits. Furthermore, mimicking site-specific tau phosphorylation alleviated Abeta-induced neuronal death and offered protection from excitotoxicity. Our work provides insights into postsynaptic processes in AD pathogenesis and challenges a purely pathogenic role of tau phosphorylation in neuronal toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder leading to cognitive decline, neuropsychiatric symptoms, disability, caregiver burden, and premature death. It represents the most prevalent cause of dementia, and its incidence rates exponentially increase with increasing age. The number of Americans living with AD is rapidly increasing. An estimated 5.4 million Americans of all ages have AD in 2016. One in nine people aged 65 and older has AD, and by midcentury, someone in the United States will develop the disease every 33 sec. It is now accepted that neuroinflammation is a common feature of neurological disease. Inflammasomes, which are a multiprotein complex part of the innate immune system, induce inflammation in response to various stimuli, such as pathogens and stress. Inflammasomes activate proinflammatory caspases, such as caspase-1, leading to the activation of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-18, and IL-33, which promote neuroinflammation and brain pathologies. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is the best characterized in neurodegenerative diseases, in particular AD. Recent research suggests that NLRP3 could possibly be used in targeted therapies to alleviate neuroinflammation. Modulation of endogenous cellular defense mechanisms may be an innovative approach to therapeutic intervention in AD and other disorders associated with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Herein, we introduce the hormetic dose-response concept and present possible mechanisms and applications to neuroprotection. We summarize the mechanisms involved in activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its role in neuroinflammation. We also address and propose the potential therapeutic utility of the nutritional antioxidants sulforaphane and hydroxytyrosol against particular signs and symptoms of AD.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: Epidemiological evidence implicates polyphenols as potential natural therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate this prospect, five anthoxanthin polyphenols were characterized for their ability to reduce amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomer-induced neuronal responses by two mechanisms of action, modulation of oligomerization and antioxidant activity, as well as the synergy between these two mechanisms. METHODS: Anthoxanthin oligomerization modulation and antioxidant capabilities were evaluated and correlated with anthoxanthin attenuation of oligomer-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase activation using human neuroblastoma cell treatments designed to isolate these mechanisms of action and to achieve dual-action. RESULTS: While modulation of oligomerization resulted in only minor reductions to neuronal responses, anthoxanthin antioxidant action significantly attenuated oligomer-induced intracellular ROS and caspase activation. Kaempferol uniquely exhibited synergism when the two mechanisms functioned in concert, leading to a pronounced reduction in both ROS and caspase activation. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings identify the dominant mechanism by which these anthoxanthins attenuate Abeta oligomer-induced neuronal responses, elucidate their prospective synergy, and demonstrate the potential of anthoxanthin polyphenols as natural AD therapeutics.",

The present study investigates the effect of trans-crocetin, an active constituent of Crocus sativus L., to restore in vitro the reduced ability of AD patients' monocytes to degrade amyloid-beta(1-42) (Abeta42). CD14+ monocytes from 22 sporadic AD patients with moderate cognitive impairment were isolated; then, the role of trans-crocetin, purified from saffron extracts, was evaluated in terms of Abeta42 degradation rate through flow cytometry, as well as expression of cathepsin B by Western blotting. We observed that low micromolar doses of trans-crocetin enhanced Abeta42 degradation in AD monocytes through the upregulation of the lysosomal protease cathepsin B. CA074Me, a potent and selective cathepsin B inhibitor, counteracted such trans-crocetin-induced effect. These data suggest that the carotenoid trans-crocetin improves in vitro the clearance of Abeta42 through the involvement of cathepsin B, and this could be of value in developing a new anti-amyloid strategy in AD.",

    "abstract": "beta-Amyloid (Abeta) is a substance of Alzheimer disease (AD), which is generated via the amyloidogenic pathway from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase. Inhibition of Abeta production is a potential therapeutic approach to AD. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that cinnamon bark (Cinnamomi Cortex Spissus), the dried bark of Cinnamomum cassia Blume (Lauraceae), and its constituents are beneficial to AD. The methanol extract of cinnamon bark efficiently reduced Abeta40 production in Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells stably expressing APP as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Bioassay-guided isolation of cinnamon bark extract was carried out using open column chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, and the following 6 phenylpropanoids were isolated: syringaresinol (1); medioresinol (2); coumarin (3); 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (4); cryptamygin A (5); and 3',5,7-trimethoxy epicatechin (6). Among these, 4 mug/mL medioresinol and cryptamygin A reduced Abeta40 production by 50% and 60%, respectively, compared with dimethyl sulfoxide-treated control cells. The IC50 values of medioresinol and cryptamygin A for the inhibition of Abeta40 production were 10.8 and 8.2 mug/mL, respectively. Furthermore, treatment of APP-CHO cells with either compound decreased the amount of beta-secretase and sAPPbeta (the proteolytic fragment of APP catalyzed by beta-secretase). These results suggest that the antiamyloidogenic activity of cinnamon bark extract was exerted by medioresinol and cryptamygin A via a reduction in the amount of beta-secretase. The extract of cinnamon bark contains potentially valuable antiamyloidogenic agents for the prevention and treatment of AD.",

Familial Abeta mutations, such as Dutch-E22Q and Iowa-D23N, can cause severe cerebrovascular accumulation of amyloid that serves as a potent driver of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. The distinctive features of vascular amyloid that underlie its unique pathological properties remain unknown. Here, we use transgenic mouse models producing CAA mutants (Tg-SwDI) or overproducing human wild-type Abeta (Tg2576) to demonstrate that CAA-mutant vascular amyloid influences wild-type Abeta deposition in brain. We also show isolated microvascular amyloid seeds from Tg-SwDI mice drive assembly of human wild-type Abeta into distinct anti-parallel beta-sheet fibrils. These findings indicate that cerebrovascular amyloid can serve as an effective scaffold to promote rapid assembly and strong deposition of Abeta into a unique structure that likely contributes to its distinctive pathology.",

We estimated rates of clinical progression and tested whether associations between clinical progression and Alzheimer's disease neuropathology (ADNP) were modified by co-occurring Lewy body disease (LBD) or vascular brain injury (VBI). METHODS: Linear mixed effects models evaluated longitudinal trends in the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes on 2046 autopsied participants seen at a U.S. Alzheimer's Disease Center. RESULTS: Annual clinical progression was slightly faster for ADNP + LBD compared with ADNP only (P = .06) and slightly slower for ADNP + VBI (P = .003). Differences in progression were less than expected if each neuropathology independently contributed to progression; ADNP interacted with LBD (P = .002) and VBI (P = .003). In secondary models, the effect of additional pathologies on clinical progression was greater in those with intermediate compared with high levels of ADNP. DISCUSSION: The impact of co-occurring pathologies on progression may depend on severity of ADNP.",

    "abstract": "A complex interplay between beta-amyloid (Abeta), Alzheimer s disease (AD) and major depression disorder (MDD) suggests that patients with MDD have an altered cerebral Abeta metabolism and an increased risk of developing AD. In order to elucidate the relationship between antidepressant treatment and Abeta metabolism in humans, we performed a study on Abeta peptides in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients with MDD during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as an effective antidepressant treatment. We measured the levels of Abeta1-42, Abeta1-40 and of tau proteins in the CSF in 12 patients with MDD before and after a course of ECT. Abeta1-42 was significantly elevated after the ECT treatment compared to baseline, whereas no difference was found for other peptides and proteins such as Abeta1-40, Abeta ratio, total tau protein or its phosphorylated form. The most salient finding was, that the increase of Abeta1-42 after ECT was found in all patients with clinical response to the treatment, but not in those who did not respond. The number of ECT sessions of each responding patient correlated with the increase of Abeta1-42 in the CSF. Our data point towards to a specific antidepressant mechanism which is not based on a general increase of Abeta, but seems to involve merely Abeta1-42, the isoform with highest amyloidogenic potential. We present the first study in humans demonstrating an isolated mobilization of Abeta1-42 in the CSF of patients with depression who respond to an ECT treatment.",

    "abstract": "Transcellular propagation of tau aggregates may underlie the progression of pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Braak staging (B1, B2, B3) is based on phospho-tau accumulation within connected brain regions: entorhinal cortex (B1); hippocampus/limbic system (B2); and frontal and parietal lobes (B3). We previously developed a specific and sensitive assay that uses flow cytometry to quantify tissue seeding activity based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in cells that stably express tau reporter proteins. In a tauopathy mouse model, we have detected seeding activity far in advance of histopathological changes. It remains unknown whether individuals with AD also develop seeding activity prior to accumulation of phospho-tau. We measured tau seeding activity across four brain regions (hippocampus, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and cerebellum) in 104 fresh-frozen human AD brain samples from all Braak stages. We observed widespread seeding activity, notably in regions predicted to be free of phospho-tau deposition, and in detergent-insoluble fractions that lacked tau detectable by ELISA. Seeding activity correlated positively with Braak stage and negatively with MMSE. Our results are consistent with early transcellular propagation of tau seeds that triggers subsequent development of neuropathology. The FRET-based seeding assay may also complement standard neuropathological classification of tauopathies.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hyperactivity of the classical axis of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), mediated by angiotensin II (Ang II) activation of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) degrades Ang II to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang (1-7)) and counter-regulates the classical axis of RAS. We have investigated the expression and distribution of ACE-2 in post-mortem human brain tissue in relation to AD pathology and classical RAS axis activity. METHODS: We measured ACE-2 activity by fluorogenic peptide substrate assay in mid-frontal cortex (Brodmann area 9) in a cohort of AD (n = 90) and age-matched non-demented controls (n = 59) for which we have previous data on ACE-1 activity, amyloid beta (Abeta) level and tau pathology, as well as known ACE1 (rs1799752) indel polymorphism, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy severity scores. RESULTS: ACE-2 activity was significantly reduced in AD compared with age-matched controls (P < 0.0001) and correlated inversely with levels of Abeta (r = -0.267, P < 0.001) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) pathology (r = -0.327, P < 0.01). ACE-2 was reduced in individuals possessing an APOE epsilon4 allele (P < 0.05) and was associated with ACE1 indel polymorphism (P < 0.05), with lower ACE-2 activity in individuals homozygous for the ACE1 insertion AD risk allele. ACE-2 activity correlated inversely with ACE-1 activity (r = -0.453, P < 0.0001), and the ratio of ACE-1 to ACE-2 was significantly elevated in AD (P < 0.0001). Finally, we show that the ratio of Ang II to Ang (1-7) (a proxy measure of ACE-2 activity indicating  conversion of Ang II to Ang (1-7)) is reduced in AD. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our findings indicate that ACE-2 activity is reduced in AD and is an important regulator of the central classical ACE-1/Ang II/AT1R axis of RAS, and also that dysregulation of this pathway likely plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of AD.",

Abeta sequence and lipid composition are essential variables to consider when elucidating the impact of biological membranes on Abeta structure and the effect of Abeta on membrane integrity. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations testing two Abeta sequences, human and rat Abeta (HAbeta and RAbeta, respectively), and five lipid types were performed to assess the effect of these variables on membrane perturbation and potential link to AD phenotype differences based on differences in sequence. All metrics agree insomuch that monomeric HAbeta and RAbeta contribute to membrane perturbation by causing a more rigid, gel-like lipid phase. Differences between HAbeta and RAbeta binding on degree of membrane perturbation were based on lipid headgroup properties. Cholesterol was found to moderate the amount of perturbation caused by HAbeta and RAbeta in a model raft membrane. The difference in position of an arginine residue between HAbeta and RAbeta influenced peptide-membrane interactions and was determined to be the mediating factor in observed differences in lipid affinity and degree of membrane disruption. Overall, this work increases our understanding of the influence of sequence and lipid type on Abeta-membrane interactions and their relationship to AD.",

Accumulating evidence indicates that circadian and sleep disturbances, which have long been considered symptoms of many neurodegenerative conditions, may actually drive pathogenesis early in the course of these diseases. In this Review, we explore potential cellular and molecular mechanisms linking circadian dysfunction and sleep loss to neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus on Alzheimer's disease. We examine the interplay between central and peripheral circadian rhythms, circadian clock gene function, and sleep in maintaining brain homeostasis, and discuss therapeutic implications. The circadian clock and sleep can influence a number of key processes involved in neurodegeneration, suggesting that these systems might be manipulated to promote healthy brain aging.",

The present study was conducted to explore the mechanisms involved in the beneficial effect of IGF-1 against Abeta-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. We found that pretreatment with IGF-1 attenuated Abeta25-35-induced loss of cell viability and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, IGF-1 inhibited the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased the antioxidant activity in Abeta25-35-treated cells. Further, IGF-1 significantly promoted the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, and upregulated the expression of its downstream gene heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Moreover, LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor, was found to completely abolish the protective effect of IGF-1 on Abeta25-35-induced apoptosis and ROS generation. Together, our findings suggest that IGF-1 protects SH-SY5Y cells against Abeta25-35-induced cell injury by scavenging ROS via the PI3K/Akt-Nrf2 signaling pathway.",

These peptides play a role in Alzheimer's and other dementia-related diseases. The cargo binding domain of the kinesin-1 light chain motor protein (KLC1) may be responsible for transporting APP either directly or via interaction with C-jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein 1 (JIP1). However, to date there has been no direct experimental or computational assessment of such binding at the atomistic level. We used molecular dynamics and free energy estimations to gauge the affinity for the binary complexes of KLC1, APP, and JIP1. We find that all binary complexes (KLC1:APP, KLC1:JIP1, and APP:JIP1) contain conformations with favorable binding free energies. For KLC1:APP the inclusion of approximate entropies reduces the favorability. This is likely due to the flexibility of the 42-residue APP protein. In all cases we analyze atomistic/residue driving forces for favorable interactions. Proteins 2017; 85:221-234.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in the brain, which is produced by the proteolysis of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Recently, the mitochondrial transcription factor 4 (MTERF4), a member of the MTERF family, was implicated in regulating mitochondrial DNA transcription and directly in controlling mitochondrial ribosomal translation. The present study identified a novel role for MTERF4 in shifting APP processing toward the amyloidogenic pathway. The levels of MTERF4 protein were significantly increased in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. In addition, the overexpression of MTERF4 induced a significant increase in the levels of APP protein and secreted Abeta42 in HEK293-APPswe cells compared with control cells. Further, MTERF4 overexpression shifted APP processing from alpha-to beta-cleavage, as indicated by decreased C83 levels and elevated C99 levels. Finally, the MTERF4 overexpression suppressed a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) expression via a transcriptional mechanism. Taken together, these results suggest that MTERF4 promotes the amyloidogenic processing of APP by inhibiting ADAM10 in HEK293-APPswe cells; therefore, MTERF4 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD.",

Two late-onset AD risk factors, Bin1 and CD2AP, are regulators of endocytic trafficking, but it is unclear how their endocytic function regulates Abeta generation in neurons. We identify a novel neuron-specific polarisation of Abeta generation controlled by Bin1 and CD2AP We discover that Bin1 and CD2AP control Abeta generation in axonal and dendritic early endosomes, respectively. Both Bin1 loss of function and CD2AP loss of function raise Abeta generation by increasing APP and BACE1 convergence in early endosomes, however via distinct sorting events. When Bin1 levels are reduced, BACE1 is trapped in tubules of early endosomes and fails to recycle in axons. When CD2AP levels are reduced, APP is trapped at the limiting membrane of early endosomes and fails to be sorted for degradation in dendrites. Hence, Bin1 and CD2AP keep APP and BACE1 apart in early endosomes by distinct mechanisms in axon and dendrites. Individuals carrying variants of either factor would slowly accumulate Abeta in neurons increasing the risk for late-onset AD.",

A water-soluble VIEgen with a red fluorescence emission shows a pronounced, blue-shifted emission with Abeta peptide monomers and fibrils. The enhancement in blue fluorescence can be ascribed to the restriction of the molecular vibration by selectively binding to Abeta. We determine an increasing blue-to-red emission ratio of the VIEgen with both the concentration and fibrogenesis time of Abeta, thereby enabling a ratiometric detection of Abeta in its different morphological forms. Importantly, the VIEgen was proven to be suitable for the fluorescence imaging of small Abeta plaques in the hippocampus of a transgenic mouse brain (five months old), with the blue and red emissions well overlapped on the Abeta. This research offers a new rationale to design molecular VIE probes for biological applications.",

Starting from separate random monomers, various fibrillar oligomers with distinct structural characteristics were identified using discontinuous molecular dynamics simulations based on a coarse-grained protein model. From the structures observed in the simulations, two characteristic oligomer sizes emerged, trimer and paranuclei, which generated distinct structural patterns during fibrillization. A majority of the simulations for trimers and tetramers formed non-fibrillar oligomers, which primarily progress to off-pathway oligomers. Pentamers and hexamers were significantly converted into U-shape fibrillar structures, meaning that these oligomers, called paranuclei, might be potent on-pathway intermediates in fibril formation. Fibrillar oligomers larger than hexamers generated substantial polymorphism in which hybrid structures were readily formed and homogeneous fibrillar structures appeared infrequently.",

    "abstract": "Considerable clinical and epidemiological evidence links Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this connection are largely unknown. We reported recently that soluble Abeta oligomers (AbetaOs), toxins that accumulate in AD brains and are thought to instigate synapse damage and memory loss, induce depressive-like behavior in mice. Here, we report that the mechanism underlying this action involves AbetaO-induced microglial activation, aberrant TNF-alpha signaling, and decreased brain serotonin levels. Inactivation or ablation of microglia blocked the increase in brain TNF-alpha and abolished depressive-like behavior induced by AbetaOs. Significantly, we identified serotonin as a negative regulator of microglial activation. Finally, AbetaOs failed to induce depressive-like behavior in Toll-like receptor 4-deficient mice and in mice harboring a nonfunctional TLR4 variant in myeloid cells. Results establish that AbetaOs trigger depressive-like behavior via a double impact on brain serotonin levels and microglial activation, unveiling a cross talk between brain innate immunity and serotonergic signaling as a key player in mood alterations in AD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the main cause of dementia in the world. Brain accumulation of amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaOs) is a major feature in the pathogenesis of AD. Although clinical and epidemiological data suggest a strong connection between AD and depression, the underlying mechanisms linking these two disorders remain largely unknown. Here, we report that aberrant activation of the brain innate immunity and decreased serotonergic tonus in the brain are key players in AbetaO-induced depressive-like behavior in mice. Our findings may open up new possibilities for the development of effective therapeutics for AD and depression aimed at modulating microglial function.",

    "title": "Abeta Amyloid Pathology Affects the Hearts of Patients With Alzheimer's Disease: Mind the Heart.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individually, heart failure (HF) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are severe threats to population health, and their potential coexistence is an alarming prospect. In addition to sharing analogous epidemiological and genetic profiles, biochemical characteristics, and common triggers, the authors recently recognized common molecular and pathological features between the 2 conditions. Whereas cognitive impairment has been linked to HF through perfusion defects, angiopathy, and inflammation, whether patients with AD present with myocardial dysfunction, and if the 2 conditions bear a common pathogenesis as neglected siblings are unknown. OBJECTIVES: Here, the authors investigated whether amyloid beta (Abeta) protein aggregates are present in the hearts of patients with a primary diagnosis of AD, affecting myocardial function. METHODS: The authors examined myocardial function in a retrospective cross-sectional study from a cohort of AD patients and age-matched controls. Imaging and proteomics approaches were used to identify and quantify Abeta deposits in AD heart and brain specimens compared with controls. Cell shortening and calcium transients were measured on isolated adult cardiomyocytes. RESULTS: Echocardiographic measurements of myocardial function suggest that patients with AD present with an anticipated diastolic dysfunction. As in the brain, Abeta40 and Abeta42 are present in the heart, and their expression is increased in AD. CONCLUSIONS: Here, the authors provide the first report of the presence of compromised myocardial function and intramyocardial deposits of Abeta in AD patients. The findings depict a novel biological framework in which AD may be viewed either as a systemic disease or as a metastatic disorder leading to heart, and possibly multiorgan failure. AD and HF are both debilitating and life-threatening conditions, affecting enormous patient populations. Our findings underline a previously dismissed problem of a magnitude that will require new diagnostic approaches and treatments for brain and heart disease, and their combination.",

    "abstract": "Beta amyloid (Abeta) triggers the elimination of excitatory synaptic connections in the CNS, an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. Oligomeric assemblies of Abeta peptide associate with excitatory synapses resulting in synapse elimination through a process that requires NMDA-type glutamate receptor activation. Whether Abeta affects synaptic NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function directly and acts locally at synapses to which it has bound and whether synaptic activity influences Abeta synaptic binding and synaptotoxicity have remained fundamental questions. Here, we used subcellular Ca2+ imaging in rat hippocampal neurons to visualize NMDAR function at individual synapses before and after Abeta application. Abeta triggered a robust impairment of NMDAR Ca2+ entry at most, but not all, synapses. NMDAR function was more severely impaired at highly active synapses and synapses with bound Abeta, but activity was not required for Abeta synapse binding. Blocking NMDARs during Abeta exposure prevented Abeta-mediated impairment. Finally, Abeta impaired NMDAR Ca2+ entry at doses much lower than those required for NMDAR internalization, revealing a novel, potent mode of NMDAR regulation by Abeta. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Amyloid beta (Abeta) is strongly implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Abeta triggers the elimination of excitatory synapses through a mechanism that requires NMDA receptors (NMDARs). However, little is known about how or whether Abeta influences synaptic NMDAR function. We used an imaging-based assay to investigate the relationship among Abeta binding, activity, and NMDAR function at individual synapses. Abeta triggered a robust impairment of NMDAR Ca2+ entry at most, but not all, synapses. NMDAR function was more severely impaired at highly active synapses and synapses with bound Abeta. Blocking NMDARs during Abeta exposure prevented Abeta-mediated impairment. Together, our experiments reveal a novel use-dependent, potent, and local mode of Abeta-mediated NMDAR impairment.",

    "abstract": "Tau prions are thought to aggregate in the central nervous system, resulting in neurodegeneration. Among the tauopathies, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common, whereas argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), Pick's disease (PiD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are less prevalent. Brain extracts from deceased individuals with PiD, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by three-repeat (3R) tau prions, were used to infect HEK293T cells expressing 3R tau fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Extracts from AGD, CBD, and PSP patient samples, which contain four-repeat (4R) tau prions, were transmitted to HEK293 cells expressing 4R tau fused to YFP. These studies demonstrated that prion propagation in HEK cells requires isoform pairing between the infecting prion and the recipient substrate. Interestingly, tau aggregates in AD and CTE, containing both 3R and 4R isoforms, were unable to robustly infect either 3R- or 4R-expressing cells. However, AD and CTE prions were able to replicate in HEK293T cells expressing both 3R and 4R tau. Unexpectedly, increasing the level of 4R isoform expression alone supported the propagation of both AD and CTE prions. These results allowed us to determine the levels of tau prions in AD and CTE brain extracts.",

Herein, we describe the computational approach for the assessment of inhibitory activity against Abeta aggregation. The influence of novel inhibitors on amyloid Abeta17-42 was studied by employing of molecular docking and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We found that the number of intermolecular backbone hydrogen bonds at the end of 100ns MD simulation was correlated with the level of anti-aggregation potency of studied compounds.

    "title": "Differential copper binding to alpha-synuclein and its disease-associated mutants affect the aggregation and amyloid formation.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Copper is an essential trace element required for the proper functioning of various enzymes present in the central nervous system. An imbalance in the copper homeostasis results in the pathology of various neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's Disease. Hence, residue specific interaction of Cu2+ to alpha-Syn along with the familial mutants H50Q and G51D needs to be studied in detail. METHODS: We investigated the residue specific mapping of Cu2+ binding sites and binding strength using solution-state NMR and ITC respectively. The aggregation kinetics, secondary structural changes, and morphology of the formed fibrils in the presence and absence of Cu2+ were studied using fluorescence, CD, and AFM respectively. RESULTS: Copper binding to alpha-Syn takes place at three different sites with a higher affinity for the region 48-53. While one of the sites got abolished in the case of H50Q, the mutant G51D showed a binding pattern similar to WT. The aggregation kinetics of these proteins in the presence of Cu2+ showed an enhanced rate of fibril formation with a pronounced effect for G51D. CONCLUSION: Cu2+ binding results in the destabilization of long-range tertiary interactions in alpha-Syn leading to the exposure of highly amyloidogenic NAC region which results in the increased rate of fibril formation. Although the residues 48-53 have a stronger affinity for Cu2+ in case of WT and G51D, the binding is not responsible for enhancing the rate of fibril formation in case of H50Q. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These findings will help in the better understanding of Cu2+ catalyzed aggregation of synucleins.",

Here we show reduced, behaviourally driven gamma oscillations before the onset of plaque formation or cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Optogenetically driving fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (FS-PV)-interneurons at gamma (40 Hz), but not other frequencies, reduces levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta)1-40 and Abeta 1-42 isoforms. Gene expression profiling revealed induction of genes associated with morphological transformation of microglia, and histological analysis confirmed increased microglia co-localization with Abeta. Subsequently, we designed a non-invasive 40 Hz light-flickering regime that reduced Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 levels in the visual cortex of pre-depositing mice and mitigated plaque load in aged, depositing mice. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated function of gamma rhythms in recruiting both neuronal and glial responses to attenuate Alzheimer's-disease-associated pathology.",

    "title": "A computational study of self-assembled hexapeptide inhibitors against amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation.",
    "abstract": "The fibrillation and deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in human brains are pathologically linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Development of different inhibitors (peptides, organic molecules, and nanoparticles) to prevent Abeta aggregation becomes a promising therapeutic strategy for AD treatment. We recently propose a \"like-interacts-like\" design principle to computationally design/screen and experimentally validate a new set of hexapeptide inhibitors with completely different sequences from the Abeta sequence. These hexapeptide inhibitors inhibit Abeta aggregation and reduce Abeta-induced cytotoxicity. However, inhibitory mechanisms of these hexapeptides and the underlying interactions between hexapeptides and Abeta remain unclear. Herein we apply multi-scale computational methods (quantum-chemical calculations, molecular docking and explicit-solvent molecular dynamic simulation) to explore the structure, dynamics, and interaction between 3 identified hexapeptides (CTLWWG, GTVWWG, and CTIYWG) and different Abeta-derived fragments and an Abeta17-42 pentamer. When interacting with 6 Abeta-derived fragments, 3 hexapeptide inhibitors show stronger interactions with two lysine-included fragments (16KLVFFA21 and 27NKGAII33) than other fragments, indicating different sequence-specific interactions with Abeta. When interacting with the Abeta17-42 pentamer, the 3 peptides show similar binding modes and interaction mechanisms by preferentially binding to the edge of the Abeta17-42 pentamer to potentially block the Abeta elongation pathway. This work provides structural-based binding information on further modification and optimization of these peptide inhibitors to experimentally enhance their inhibitory abilities against Abeta aggregation.",

    "title": "LRP1 modulates the microglial immune response via regulation of JNK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation is characterized by microglial activation and the increased levels of cytokines and chemokines in the central nervous system (CNS). Recent evidence has implicated both beneficial and toxic roles of microglia when over-activated upon nerve injury or in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a major receptor for apolipoprotein E (apoE) and amyloid-beta (Abeta), which play critical roles in AD pathogenesis. LRP1 regulates inflammatory responses in peripheral tissues by modulating the release of inflammatory cytokines and phagocytosis. However, the roles of LRP1 in brain innate immunity and neuroinflammation remain unclear. METHODS: In this study, we determined whether LRP1 modulates microglial activation by knocking down Lrp1 in mouse primary microglia. LRP1-related functions in microglia were also assessed in the presence of LRP1 antagonist, the receptor-associated protein (RAP). The effects on the production of inflammatory cytokines were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Potential involvement of specific signaling pathways in LRP1-regulated functions including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) were assessed using specific inhibitors. RESULTS: We found that knocking down of Lrp1 in mouse primary microglia led to the activation of both c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and NF-kappaB pathways with corresponding enhanced sensitivity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Similar effects were observed when microglia were treated with LRP1 antagonist RAP. In addition, treatment with pro-inflammatory stimuli suppressed Lrp1 expression in microglia. Interestingly, NF-kappaB inhibitor not only suppressed the production of cytokines induced by the knockdown of Lrp1 but also restored the down-regulated expression of Lrp1 by LPS. CONCLUSIONS: Our study uncovers that LRP1 suppresses microglial activation by modulating JNK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Given that dysregulation of LRP1 has been associated with AD pathogenesis, our work reveals a critical regulatory mechanism of microglial activation by LRP1 that could be associated with other AD-related pathways thus further nominating LRP1 as a potential disease-modifying target for the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: According to new diagnostic guidelines for Alzheimer's disease (AD), biomarkers enable estimation of the individual likelihood of underlying AD pathophysiology and the associated risk of progression to AD dementia for patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Nonetheless, how conflicting biomarker constellations affect the progression risk is still elusive. The present study explored the impact of different cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker constellations on the progression risk of MCI patients. METHODS: A multicentre cohort of 469 patients with MCI and available CSF biomarker results and clinical follow-up data was considered. Biomarker values were categorized as positive for AD, negative or borderline. Progression risk differences between patients with different constellations of total Tau (t-Tau), phosphorylated Tau at threonine 181 (p-Tau) and amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta42) were studied. Group comparison analyses and Cox regression models were employed. RESULTS: Patients with all biomarkers positive for AD (N = 145) had the highest hazard for progression to dementia due to AD, whilst patients with no positive biomarkers (N = 111) had the lowest. The risk of patients with only abnormal p-Tau and/or t-Tau (N = 49) or with positive Abeta42 in combination with positive t-Tau or p-Tau (N = 119) is significantly lower than that of patients with all biomarkers positive. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of progression to dementia due to AD differs between patients with different CSF biomarker constellations.",

However, understanding how these genes are involved in the pathophysiology of AD is one of the main challenges of the \"post-GWAS\" era. At least 123 genes are located within the 19 susceptibility loci; hence, a conventional approach (studying the genes one by one) would not be time- and cost-effective. We therefore developed a genome-wide, high-content siRNA screening approach and used it to assess the functional impact of gene under-expression on APP metabolism. We found that 832 genes modulated APP metabolism. Eight of these genes were located within AD susceptibility loci. Only FERMT2 (a beta3-integrin co-activator) was also significantly associated with a variation in cerebrospinal fluid Abeta peptide levels in 2886 AD cases. Lastly, we showed that the under-expression of FERMT2 increases Abeta peptide production by raising levels of mature APP at the cell surface and facilitating its recycling. Taken as a whole, our data suggest that FERMT2 modulates the AD risk by regulating APP metabolism and Abeta peptide production.",

Circular dichroism experiments reveal that charge-preserving alterations of the amino acid sidechain attenuate the characteristic random coil to beta-sheet transition associated with the wildtype peptide. Removal of the negative charge from residue 22, a trait observed with all known familial mutations at this residue, gives rise to a peptide with limited random coil propensity and high beta-sheet characteristics.

    "abstract": "Amyloidogenic proteins amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) self-assemble into fibrillar amyloid deposits, senile plaques and Lewy bodies, pathological features of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, respectively. Interestingly, a portion of Alzheimer's disease cases also exhibit aggregation of alpha-syn into Lewy bodies, and growing evidence also suggests that Abeta and alpha-syn oligomers are toxic. Therefore, the simultaneous inhibition through sequestration of the two amyloidogenic proteins may constitute a promising therapeutic strategy. Recently discovered beta-wrapin proteins pave the way toward this direction as they can inhibit the aggregation and toxicity of both Abeta and alpha-syn. Here, we used computational methods, primarily molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations, to shed light into the key interaction-based commonalities leading to the dual binding properties of beta-wrapins for both amyloidogenic proteins, to identify which interactions potentially act as switches diminishing beta-wrapins' binding activity for Abeta/alpha-syn, and to examine the binding properties of the current most potent beta-wrapin for Abeta. Our analysis provides insights into the distinct role of the key determinants leading to beta-wrapin binding to Abeta and alpha-syn, and suggests that the Abeta 18VFFAED23 and alpha-syn 38LYVGSK43 are key domains determining the binding specificity of a beta-wrapin.

The Abeta peptides are thought to be serially arranged in the same molecular conformation along the fibril axis. However, to understand the amyloid extension mechanism, we must understand the amyloid fibril structure and fluctuation at the fibril end, which has not been revealed to date. Here, we reveal these features by all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Abeta42 and Abeta40 fibrils in explicit water. The structure and fluctuation were observed to differ between the two ends. At the even end, the Abeta peptide always took a closed form wherein beta1 and beta2 were closely spaced. The Abeta peptide fluctuated more at the odd end and took an open form wherein the two beta-sheets were well separated. The differences are attributed to the stronger beta-sheet formation by the beta1 exposed at the even end than the beta2 exposed at the odd end. Along with the small fluctuations at the even end, these results explain why the fibril extends from one end only, as observed in experiments. Our MD results agree well with recent observations by high-speed atomic force microscopy.",

    "abstract": "Labile heme has been suggested to have an impact in several severe diseases. In the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD), however, decreased levels of free heme have been reported. Therefore, we were looking for an assay system that can be used for heme concentration determination. From a biochemical point of view the peroxidase activity of the Abeta-heme complex seemed quite attractive to pursue this goal. As a consequence, a peptide that is able to increase the readout even in the case of a low heme concentration is favorable. The examination of Abeta- and non-Abeta-derived peptides in complex with heme revealed that the peroxidase-like activity significantly depends on the peptide sequence and length. A 23mer His-based peptide derived from human fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 in complex with heme exhibited a significantly higher peroxidase activity than Abeta(40)-heme. Structural modeling of both complexes demonstrated that heme binding via a histidine can be supported by hydrogen bond interactions of a basic residue near the propionate carboxyl function of protoporphyrin IX. Furthermore, the interplay of Abeta-heme and the lipoprotein LDL as a potential physiological effector of Abeta was examined.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta 1-42 peptide (Abeta1-42) is associated with plaque formation in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pharmacodynamic studies of AD therapeutics that lower the concentrations of Abeta1-42 in peripheral blood require highly sensitive assays for its measurement. A digital enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using single molecule array (Simoa) technology has been developed that provides improved sensitivity compared with conventional ELISA methods using the same antibody reagents. METHODS: A sensitive digital ELISA for measurement of Abeta1-42 using antibodies 3D6 and 21F12 was developed. Assay performance was evaluated by repeated testing of pooled human plasma and buffer diluent quality control samples to determine relative accuracy, intra- and inter-assay precision, limit of detection (LOD), lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), dilutional linearity, and spike recovery. The optimized assay was used to quantify Abeta1-42 in clinical samples from patients treated with the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 inhibitor LY2886721. RESULTS: The prototype assay measured Abeta1-42 with an LOD of 0.3 pg/ml and an LLOQ of 2.8 pg/ml in plasma, calibrated using an Abeta1-42 peptide standard from Fujirebio. Assay precision was acceptable with intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation both being <=10%. Dilutional linearity was demonstrated in sample diluent and immunodepleted human plasma. Analyte spike recovery ranged from 51% to 93% with a mean of 80%. This assay was able to quantify Abeta1-42 in all of the 84 clinical samples tested. A rapid reduction in levels of Abeta1-42 was detected within 1 h after drug treatment, and a dose-dependent decrease of Abeta1-42 levels was also observed over the time course of sample collection. CONCLUSIONS: This digital ELISA has potential utility in clinical applications for quantification of Abeta1-42 in plasma where high sensitivity and precision are required.",

    "title": "Distribution of cellular HSV-1 receptor expression in human brain.",
    "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a neurotropic virus linked to a range of acute and chronic neurological disorders affecting distinct regions of the brain. Unusually, HSV-1 entry into cells requires the interaction of viral proteins glycoprotein D (gD) and glycoprotein B (gB) with distinct cellular receptor proteins. Several different gD and gB receptors have been identified, including TNFRSF14/HVEM and PVRL1/nectin 1 as gD receptors and PILRA, MAG, and MYH9 as gB receptors. We investigated the expression of these receptor molecules in different areas of the adult and developing human brain using online transcriptome databases. Whereas all HSV-1 receptors showed distinct expression patterns in different brain areas, the Allan Brain Atlas (ABA) reported increased expression of both gD and gB receptors in the hippocampus. Specifically, for PVRL1, TNFRFS14, and MYH9, the differential z scores for hippocampal expression, a measure of relative levels of increased expression, rose to 2.9, 2.9, and 2.5, respectively, comparable to the z score for the archetypical hippocampus-enriched mineralocorticoid receptor (NR3C2, z = 3.1). These data were confirmed at the Human Brain Transcriptome (HBT) database, but HBT data indicate that MAG expression is also enriched in hippocampus. The HBT database allowed the developmental pattern of expression to be investigated; we report that all HSV1 receptors markedly increase in expression levels between gestation and the postnatal/adult periods. These results suggest that differential receptor expression levels of several HSV-1 gD and gB receptors in the adult hippocampus are likely to underlie the susceptibility of this brain region to HSV-1 infection.",

    "abstract": "Formation of amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregates is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Accumulation of Abeta aggregates on the cell surface causes oxidative stress, and ultimately results in cell death. Consequently, inhibition of aggregate formation is predicted to be beneficial. Recently, translocation of glycoprotein quality control-related (GPQC) proteins such as chaperones and protein disulfide-isomerase (PDI) family members was reported under oxidative stress conditions. Therefore, it is possible that GPQC proteins contact Abeta peptides on the cell membrane during stress conditions. Here, we examined the effect of ER resident proteins on Abeta aggregation. Our results show that minimal expression of GPQC proteins enables Abeta to effectively avoid aggregation. Moreover, further analyses show that Abeta structure remains in the monomer state in the presence of ER proteins. Thus, our findings show that GPQC proteins have strong affinity for Abeta monomers, and suggests that the interaction between them repeatedly associates and dissociates in a short period of time.",

Notably, a key functional role for the polyamine motif in Abeta molecular recognition was also unraveled. This experimental readout, which was supported by in silico studies, gives important new insight into the polyamine's action. Hence, we propose polyamine conjugation as a promising strategy for the development of neuroprotectant leads that may contribute to decipher the complex picture of Abeta toxicity.",

Increased production of Abeta invokes a cascade of oxidative damages to neurons and eventually leads to neuronal death. This study was aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of a beta-sheet breaker alpha/beta-hybrid peptide (BSBHp) and the underlying mechanisms against Abeta40 -induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Cells were pretreated with the peptide Abeta40 to induce neurotoxicity. Assays for cell viability, cell membrane damage, cellular apoptosis, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), intracellular free Ca2+ , and key apoptotic protein levels were performed in vitro. Our results showed that pretreatment with BSBHp significantly attenuates Abeta40 -induced toxicity by retaining cell viability, suppressing generation of ROS, Ca2+ levels, and effectively protects neuronal apoptosis by suppressing pro-apoptotic protein Bax and up-regulating antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. These results suggest that alpha/beta-hybrid peptide has neuroprotective effects against Abeta40 -induced oxidative stress, which might be a potential therapeutic agent for treating or preventing neurodegenerative diseases.",

These proteins undergo a spontaneous transition from a soluble, often partially folded form, into insoluble amyloid fibrils that are rich in beta-sheets. Increasing evidence suggests that highly dynamic, polydisperse folding intermediates, which occur during fibril formation, are the toxic species in the amyloid-related diseases. Traditional condensed-phase methods are of limited use for characterizing these states because they typically only provide ensemble averages rather than information about individual oligomers. Here we report the first direct secondary-structure analysis of individual amyloid intermediates using a combination of ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry and gas-phase infrared spectroscopy. Our data reveal that oligomers of the fibril-forming peptide segments VEALYL and YVEALL, which consist of 4-9 peptide strands, can contain a significant amount of beta-sheet. In addition, our data show that the more-extended variants of each oligomer generally exhibit increased beta-sheet content.",

    "title": "Structure of Crenezumab Complex with Abeta Shows Loss of beta-Hairpin.",
    "abstract": "Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and amyloid plaque deposition in brain is postulated as a cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The precise pathological species of Abeta remains elusive although evidence suggests soluble oligomers may be primarily responsible for neurotoxicity. Crenezumab is a humanized anti-Abeta monoclonal IgG4 that binds multiple forms of Abeta, with higher affinity for aggregated forms, and that blocks Abeta aggregation, and promotes disaggregation. To understand the structural basis for this binding profile and activity, we determined the crystal structure of crenezumab in complex with Abeta. The structure reveals a sequential epitope and conformational requirements for epitope recognition, which include a subtle but critical element that is likely the basis for crenezumab's versatile binding profile. We find interactions consistent with high affinity for multiple forms of Abeta, particularly oligomers. Of note, crenezumab also sequesters the hydrophobic core of Abeta and breaks an essential salt-bridge characteristic of the beta-hairpin conformation, eliminating features characteristic of the basic organization in Abeta oligomers and fibrils, and explains crenezumab's inhibition of aggregation and promotion of disaggregation. These insights highlight crenezumab's unique mechanism of action, particularly regarding Abeta oligomers, and provide a strong rationale for the evaluation of crenezumab as a potential AD therapy.",

    "title": "Chaperone-like Activity of Calnuc Prevents Amyloid Aggregation.",
    "abstract": "Calnuc is a ubiquitously expressed protein of the EF-hand Ca2+-binding superfamily. Previous studies have implicated it in Ca2+-sensitive physiological processes, whereas details of its function and involvement in human diseases are lacking. Drawing upon the sequence homology of calnuc with calreticulin, we propose it functions as a molecular chaperone-like protein. In cells under thermal, chemical [urea and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl)], and acidic stress, calnuc exhibits properties similar to those of established chaperone-like proteins (GRP78, spectrin, and alpha-crystallin), effectively demonstrated by its ability to suppress aggregation of malate dehydrogenase (MDH), alcohol dehydrogenase, and catalase. Calnuc aids in refolding of MDH with retention of 80% of its enzymatic activity. In HEK293 cells subjected to heat shock, calnuc chaperones luciferase, protecting its activity. Our in vitro and cell culture results establish the ability of calnuc to inhibit fibrillation of insulin and lysozyme and validate its neuroprotective role in cells treated with amyloid fibrils. Calnuc also rescues cells from fibrillar toxicity (caused by misfolded or aggregated proteins), providing a plausible explanation for the previous observation of its low level of expression in brains affected by Alzheimer's disease. We propose that calnuc is possibly involved in controlling protein unfolding diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), prion disease, and type II diabetes.",

    "abstract": "The ratio of signal intensity in T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was recently proposed to enhance the sensitivity of detecting changes in disease-related signal intensity. The objective of this study was to test the effectiveness of T1w/T2w image ratios as an easily accessible biomarker for amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation. We performed the T1w/T2w analysis in cognitively normal elderly individuals. We applied [11C] Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET to the same individuals, and Abeta deposition was quantified by its binding potential (PiB-BPND). The subjects were divided into low and high PiB-BPND groups, and group differences in regional T1w/T2w values were evaluated. In the regions where we found a significant group difference, we conducted a correlation analysis between regional T1w/T2w values and PiB-BPND. Subjects with high global cortical PiB-BPND showed a significantly higher regional T1w/T2w ratio in the frontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. We found a significant positive relationship between the regional T1w/T2w ratio and Abeta accumulation. Moreover, with a T1w/T2w ratio of 0.55 in the medial frontal regions, we correctly discriminated subjects with high PiB-BPND from the entire subject population with a sensitivity of 84.6% and specificity of 80.0%. Our results indicate that early Abeta-induced pathological changes can be detected using the T1w/T2w ratio on MRI. We believe that the T1w/T2w ratio is a prospective stable biological marker of early Abeta accumulation in cognitively normal individuals. The availability of such an accessible marker would improve the efficiency of clinical trials focusing on the initial disease stages by reducing the number of subjects who require screening by Abeta-PET scan or lumbar puncture.",

Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation triggered by Abeta is responsible for retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction in the onset of AMD; however, the detailed molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the involvement of NADPH oxidase- and mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the process of Abeta1-40 -induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LPS-primed ARPE-19 cells. The results showed that Abeta1-40 could induce excessive ROS generation, MAPK/NF-kappaB signaling activation and subsequently NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LPS-primed ARPE-19 cells. Furthermore, the inductive effect of Abeta1-40 on NLRP3 inflammasome activation was mediated in a manner dependent on NADPH oxidase- and mitochondria-derived ROS. Our findings may provide a novel insight into the molecular mechanism by which Abeta contributes to the early-stage AMD.",

Surprisingly, co-culturing resulted in proliferation, recruitment, and clustering of old microglial cells around amyloid plaques and clearance of the plaque halo. Depletion of either old or young microglial cells prevented amyloid plaque clearance, indicating a synergistic effect of both populations. Exposing old microglial cells to conditioned media of young microglia or addition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was sufficient to induce microglial proliferation and reduce amyloid plaque size. Our data suggest that microglial dysfunction in AD may be reversible and their phagocytic ability can be modulated to limit amyloid accumulation. This novel ex vivo model provides a valuable system for identification, screening, and testing of compounds aimed to therapeutically reinforce microglial phagocytosis.",

However, the physiological function of APP remains unknown. In this study, we described reduced sodium current densities in APP knockout hippocampal neurons. Coexpression of APP or its intracellular domains containing a VTPEER motif with Nav1.6 sodium channels in Xenopus oocytes resulted in an increase in peak sodium currents, which was enhanced by constitutively active Go mutant and blocked by a dominant negative mutant. JNK and CDK5 inhibitor attenuated increases in Nav1.6 sodium currents induced by overexpression of APP. Nav1.6 sodium currents were increased by APPT668E (mutant Thr to Glu) and decreased by T668A (mutant Thr to ALa) mutant, respectively. The cell surface expression of Nav1.6 sodium channels in the white matter of spinal cord and the spinal conduction velocity is decreased in APP, p35 and JNK3 knockout mice. Therefore, APP modulates Nav1.6 sodium channels through a Go-coupled JNK pathway, which is dependent on phosphorylation of APP at Thr668.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced neuron death is considered central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among several death modalities, autophagy and apoptosis play important roles in Abeta-induced neuron death suggesting that there may be regulatory mechanisms that initiate both cell death pathways. However, molecules that govern both pathways have not been identified. Here, we report that, upon Abeta treatment, tribbles pseudokinase 3 (Trib3, an ortholog of Drosophila Tribbles) is up-regulated in neurons both in vivo and in vitro Increased Trib3 levels inhibited the activity of the kinase Akt by interacting with it. As a result, forkhead box O1 (FoxO1), a transcription factor that is negatively regulated by Akt, was activated, translocated to the nucleus, and induced the pro-apoptotic gene BCL2-like 11 (Bim). Conversely, FoxO1 responded to Abeta insult by binding to the Trib3 gene promoter, enhancing its expression. Our investigations further revealed that Trib3 also induces autophagy. We found that Trib3 indirectly activates unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase1 (Ulk1) by impeding phosphorylation of, and thus inactivating, a negative regulator of Ulk1, mechanistic target of rapamycin. Ulk1 activation augmented autophagosome formation and reduced autophagy flux. Thus, Trib3 was required for formation of autophagosomes, which accumulated in neurons as autophagic flux was thwarted. Most importantly, silencing endogenous Trib3 strongly protected neurons from Abeta insult. Our results suggest that a self-amplifying feed-forward loop among Trib3, Akt, and FoxO1 in Abeta-treated neurons induces both apoptosis and autophagy, culminating in neuron death. Thus, Trib3 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for AD.",

The use of chemical kinetics has recently enabled highly accurate quantifications of the effects of small molecules on specific microscopic steps in Abeta42 aggregation. Here, we exploit this approach to develop a rational drug discovery strategy against Abeta42 aggregation that uses as a read-out the changes in the nucleation and elongation rate constants caused by candidate small molecules. We thus identify a pool of compounds that target specific microscopic steps in Abeta42 aggregation. We then test further these small molecules in human cerebrospinal fluid and in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of AD. Our results show that this strategy represents a powerful approach to identify systematically small molecule lead compounds, thus offering an appealing opportunity to reduce the attrition problem in drug discovery.",

    "title": "Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity are impaired in APP/PS1 transgenic mice prior to amyloid plaque pathogenesis and cognitive decline.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition, neurofibrillary tangles and cognitive decline. Clinical data suggests that both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are risk factors for AD-related dementia and several clinical studies have demonstrated that AD patients show alterations in peripheral glucose regulation characterized by insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemia) or hypoinsulinemia. Whether animal models of AD exhibit a pre-diabetic phenotype without additional dietary or experimental manipulation is unclear however, with contradictory data available. Further, most studies have not examined the time course of potential pre-diabetic changes relative to AD pathogenesis and cognitive decline. Thus, in this study we tested the hypothesis that a pre-diabetic phenotype (peripheral metabolic dysregulation) exists in the APP/PS1 transgenic model of AD under normal conditions and precedes AD-related pathology. Specifically, we examined glucose tolerance in male APP/PS1 mice on a C57BL/6J congenic background at 2, 4-6 and 8-9months of age by assessing fasting glucose levels, glucose tolerance, plasma insulin levels and insulin sensitivity as well as the development of pathological characteristics of AD and verified that our APP/PS1 mice develop cognitive impairment. Here we show that APP/PS1 mice, compared to wild-type controls, exhibit a significant impairment in glucose tolerance during an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (ipGTT) and a trend for increased fasting plasma insulin concentrations as early as 2months of age, while extracellular Abeta1-42 deposition occurs later and cognitive decline exists at 8-9months of age. Moreover, APP/PS1 mice did not respond as well to exogenous insulin as the wild-type controls during an intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (ipITT). Taken together, these data reveal that male APP/PS1 mice on a C57BL/6J congenic background exhibit a pre-diabetic phenotype prior to the development of AD-like pathology and that this metabolic deficit persists when they exhibit neuropathology and cognitive decline. This raises the question of whether altered glucose regulation and insulin production/secretion could contribute to AD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to stress during the sensitive period of early-life increases the risk to develop cognitive impairments and psychopathology later in life. In addition, early-life stress (ES) exposure, next to genetic causes, has been proposed to modulate the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), however evidence for this hypothesis is currently lacking. We here tested whether ES modulates progression of AD-related neuropathology and assessed the possible contribution of neuroinflammatory factors in this. We subjected wild-type (WT) and transgenic APP/PS1 mice, as a model for amyloid neuropathology, to chronic ES from postnatal day (P)2 to P9. We next studied how ES exposure affected; 1) amyloid beta (Abeta) pathology at an early (4month old) and at a more advanced pathological (10month old) stage, 2) neuroinflammatory mediators immediately after ES exposure as well as in adult WT mice, and 3) the neuroinflammatory response in relation to Abeta neuropathology. ES exposure resulted in a reduction of cell-associated amyloid in 4month old APP/PS1 mice, but in an exacerbation of Abeta plaque load at 10months of age, demonstrating that ES affects Abeta load in the hippocampus in an age-dependent manner. Interestingly, ES modulated various neuroinflammatory mediators in the hippocampus of WT mice as well as in response to Abeta neuropathology. In WT mice, immediately following ES exposure (P9), Iba1-immunopositive microglia exhibited reduced complexity and hippocampal interleukin (IL)-1beta expression was increased. In contrast, microglial Iba1 and CD68 were increased and hippocampal IL-6 expression was decreased at 4months, while these changes resolved by 10months of age. Finally, Abeta neuropathology triggered a neuroinflammatory response in APP/PS1 mice that was altered after ES exposure. APP/PS1 mice exhibited increased CD68 expression at 4months, which was further enhanced by ES, whereas the microglial response to Abeta neuropathology, as measured by Iba1 and CD11b, was less prominent after ES at 10months of age. Finally, the hippocampus appears to be more vulnerable for these ES-induced effects, since ES did not affect Abeta neuropathology and neuroinflammation in the entorhinal cortex of adult ES exposed mice. Overall, our results demonstrate that ES exposure has both immediate and lasting effects on the neuroinflammatory response. In the context of AD, such alterations in neuroinflammation might contribute to aggravated neuropathology in ES exposed mice, hence altering disease progression. This indicates that, at least in a genetic context, ES could aggravate AD pathology.",

Herein, the Ser8-phosphorylated Abeta (pAbeta), which is assumed to specially associate with symptomatic AD, is reported to modify the morphology, biophysical properties, cellular toxicity, and structures of Abeta fibrils. Under the same fibrillation conditions, pAbeta favors the formation of fibrils (Fpbeta), which are different from the wild-type Abeta fibrils (Fbeta). Both Fbeta and Fpbeta fibrils show single predominant morphologies. Compared with Fbeta, Fpbeta exhibits higher propagation efficiency and higher neuronal cell toxicity. The residue-specific structural differences between the Fbeta- and Fpbeta-seeded Abeta fibrils were identified using magic angle spin NMR.

    "title": "Synergistic effects of negatively charged hydrophobic nanoparticles and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate on inhibiting amyloid beta-protein aggregation.",
    "abstract": "Fibrillogenesis of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in human brain has been implicated as the main cause of Alzheimer's disease. A few small molecules from natural sources have been discovered for their inhibition effects on Abeta fibrillation, of which (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is one of the most broadly investigated compounds for its potent inhibitory activity. However, in vivo applicability of the inhibitors is largely limited by their low transmembrane efficiency. Hence, it is of great significance to develop inhibition systems that function at low concentrations. In this work, a dual-inhibitor system containing EGCG and negatively charged polymeric nanoparticles (NP10), which was also demonstrated effective on the inhibition of Abeta aggregation, was developed and comprehensively studied by extensive biophysical and biological assays. It was found that the dual-inhibitor system at low concentrations was more effective on the inhibition and detoxification of Abeta (Abeta42 and Abeta40) fibrillation than the additive effects of these two agents working individually. Namely, there was a synergistic effect of the two inhibitors. The synergism factor reached 1.25 with 5muM EGCG and 5mug/mL NP10. Kinetic studies with Abeta40 revealed that the two inhibitors functioned in different Abeta assembling stages: NP10 mainly inhibited primary nucleation, while EGCG suppressed fibril elongation and changed the fibril structure to make it show less seeding activities in the secondary nucleation. NP10 might also help EGCG binding to Abeta, leading to its enhanced inhibitory effects on fibril elongation and secondary nucleation. The synergistic effect observed in the dual-inhibitor system offered new insight into the development of potent inhibitor systems against amyloid neurotoxicity.",

    "title": "Age-dependent concomitant changes in synaptic dysfunction and GABAergic pathway in the APP/PS1 mouse model.",
    "abstract": "Synaptic dysfunction is a well-documented manifestation in animal models of Alzheimer's disease pathology. In this context, numerous studies have documented reduction in the functionality of synapses in various models. In addition, recent research has shed more light on increased excitability and its link to seizures and seizure-like activities in AD patients as well as in mouse models. These reports of hyperexcitability contradict the observed reduction in synaptic function and have been suggested to be as a result of the interplay between inhibitory and excitatory neuronal mechanism. The present study therefore investigates functional deficiency in the inhibitory system as complementary to the identified alterations in the glutamate excitatory pathway in AD. Since synaptic function deficit in AD is typically linked to progression/pathology of the disease, it is important to determine whether the deficits in the GABAergic system are functional and can be directly linked to the pattern of the disruption documented in the glutamate system. To build on previous research in this field, experiments were designed to determine if previously documented synaptic dysfunction in AD models is concomitantly observed with excitation/inhibition imbalance as suggested by observation of seizure and seizure-like pathology in such models. We report changes in synaptic function in aged APPPS1 mice not observable in the younger cohort. These changes in synaptic function are furthermore accompanied by alteration in the GABAergic neurotransmission. Thus, age-dependent alteration in the inhibitory/excitatory balance might underpin the symptomatic changes observed with the progression of Alzheimer's disease pathology including sleep disturbance and epileptic events.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a promising drug target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Prolonged BACE1 inhibition interferes with structural and functional synaptic plasticity in mice, most likely by altering the metabolism of BACE1 substrates. Seizure protein 6 (SEZ6) is predominantly cleaved by BACE1, and Sez6 knockout mice share some phenotypes with BACE1 inhibitor-treated mice. We investigated whether SEZ6 is involved in BACE1 inhibition-induced structural and functional synaptic alterations. METHODS: The function of NB-360, a novel blood-brain barrier penetrant and orally available BACE1 inhibitor, was verified by immunoblotting. In vivo microscopy was applied to monitor the impact of long-term pharmacological BACE1 inhibition on dendritic spines in the cerebral cortex of constitutive and conditional Sez6 knockout mice. Finally, synaptic functions were characterized using electrophysiological field recordings in hippocampal slices. RESULTS: BACE1 enzymatic activity was strongly suppressed by NB-360. Prolonged NB-360 treatment caused a reversible spine density reduction in wild-type mice, but it did not affect Sez6-/- mice. Knocking out Sez6 in a small subset of mature neurons also prevented the structural postsynaptic changes induced by BACE1 inhibition. Hippocampal long-term potentiation was decreased in both chronic BACE1 inhibitor-treated wild-type mice and vehicle-treated Sez6-/- mice. However, chronic NB-360 treatment did not alter long-term potentiation in CA1 neurons of Sez6-/- mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SEZ6 plays an important role in maintaining normal dendritic spine dynamics. Furthermore, SEZ6 is involved in BACE1 inhibition-induced structural and functional synaptic alterations.",

    "title": "Blood Beta-Amyloid and Tau in Down Syndrome: A Comparison with Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "Background: Changes in beta-amyloids (Abeta) and tau proteins have been noted in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and patients with both Down syndrome (DS) and AD. However, reports of changes in the early stage of regression, such as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), in DS are sparse. Methods: Seventy-eight controls, 62 patients with AD, 35 with DS and 16 with DS with degeneration (DS_D), including 9 with BPSD and 7 with dementia, were enrolled. The levels of beta-amyloids 40 and 42 (Abeta-40, Abeta-42) and tau protein in the blood were analyzed using immunomagnetic reduction (IMR). The Adaptive Behavior Dementia Questionnaire (ABDQ) was used to evaluate the clinical status of the degeneration. Results: The Abeta-40 and tau levels were higher and the Abeta-42 level and Abeta-42/Abeta-40 ratio were lower in DS than in the controls (all p < 0.001). Decreased Abeta-40 and increased Abeta-42 levels and Abeta-42/40 ratios were observed in DS_D compared with DS without degeneration (all p < 0.001). The ABDQ score was negatively correlated with the Abeta-40 level (rho = -0.556) and the tau protein level (rho = -0.410) and positively associated with the Abeta-42 level (rho = 0.621) and the Abeta-42/40 ratio (rho = 0.544; all p < 0.05). Conclusions: The Abeta-40 and Abeta-42 levels and the Abeta-42/Abeta-40 ratio are considered possible biomarkers for the early detection of degeneration in DS. The elevated Abeta-40 and tau levels in DS may indicate early neurodegeneration. The increased Abeta-42 in DS_D may reflect the neurotoxicity of Abeta-42. The paradox of the tau decreases in DS_D could be explained by a burnout phenomenon during long-term neurodegeneration. The different patterns of the plasma beta amyloids and tau protein may imply a different pathogenesis between DS with degeneration and AD in the general population, in spite of their common key pathological features.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder linked to protein aggregation, like more than twenty other human pathologies. One major protein incriminated in AD is the 42-residue amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta1-42) which aggregates to form neurotoxic oligomers and fibrils. While, low molecular weight oligomers have been evidenced as neurotoxic species, only scarce methods raise the challenge to monitor the beginning of the aggregation process, called oligomerization. We propose here an innovative and fast monitoring of the time-dependent Abeta1-42 oligomerization pattern by electrospray differential mobility analysis (ES-DMA). We developed a non-denaturing method based on ES-DMA to afford a real-time and direct characterization of the early, metastable and neurotoxic species. This technique provided their size distribution over time. At the beginning of the in vitro oligomerization process of Abeta1-42, the size distribution is characterized by two populations with modal diameters around 3.5 and 4nm, corresponding to Monomer and Small oligomers. After few hours, larger species around 10nm are observed. The results were correlated to those obtained by capillary electrophoresis. We also demonstrated the ability of our method to evaluate Abeta1-42 kinetics modulators. Thereby, ES-DMA provides new insights on Abeta1-42 oligomerization in the presence of sugar-based peptidomimetic analogs which were recently described as modulators of Abeta1-42 self-assembly and neurotoxicity inhibitors.",

    "title": "The Amyloid Precursor Protein Intracellular Domain Is an Effector Molecule of Metaplasticity.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human studies and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease suggest that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) can cause changes in synaptic plasticity and is contributing to the memory deficits seen in Alzheimer's disease. While most of these studies attribute these changes to the APP cleavage product Abeta, in recent years it became apparent that the APP intracellular domain (APP-ICD) might play a role in regulating synaptic plasticity. METHODS: To separate the effects of APP-ICD on synaptic plasticity from Abeta-dependent effects, we created a chimeric APP in which the Abeta domain is exchanged for its homologous domain from the amyloid precursor-like protein 2. RESULTS: We show that the expression of this chimeric APP has no effect on basal synaptic transmission or synaptic plasticity. However, a synaptic priming protocol, which in control cells has no effect on synaptic plasticity, leads to a complete block of subsequent long-term potentiation induction and a facilitation of long-term depression induction in neurons expressing chimeric APP. We show that the underlying mechanism for this effect on metaplasticity is caused by caspase cleavage of the APP-ICD and involves activation of ryanodine receptors. Our results shed light on the controversially discussed role of APP-ICD in regulating transcription. Because of the short timespan between synaptic priming and the effect on synaptic plasticity, it is unlikely that APP-ICD-dependent transcription is an underlying mechanism for the regulation of metaplasticity during this time period. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that the APP-ICD affects metaplasticity provides new insights into the altered regulation of synaptic plasticity during Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine whether improvements in aerobic capacity (VO2peak ) and strength after progressive resistance training (PRT) mediate improvements in cognitive function. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, double-sham, controlled trial. SETTING: University research facility. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults (aged >=55) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (N = 100). INTERVENTION: PRT and cognitive training (CT), 2 to 3 days per week for 6 months. MEASUREMENTS: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog); global, executive, and memory domains; peak strength (1 repetition maximum); and VO2peak . RESULTS: PRT increased upper (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.69, 95% confidence interval = 0.47, 0.91), lower (SMD = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.69-1.20) and whole-body (SMD = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.62-1.05) strength and percentage change in VO2peak (8.0%, 95% CI = 2.2-13.8) significantly more than sham exercise. Higher strength scores, but not greater VO2peak , were significantly associated with improvements in cognition (P < .05). Greater lower body strength significantly mediated the effect of PRT on ADAS-Cog improvements (indirect effect: beta = -0.64, 95% CI = -1.38 to -0.004; direct effect: beta = -0.37, 95% CI = -1.51-0.78) and global domain (indirect effect: beta = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.02-0.22; direct effect: beta = -0.003, 95% CI = -0.17-0.16) but not for executive domain (indirect effect: beta = 0.11, 95% CI = -0.04-0.26; direct effect: beta = 0.03, 95% CI = -0.17-0.23). CONCLUSION: High-intensity PRT results in significant improvements in cognitive function, muscle strength, and aerobic capacity in older adults with MCI. Strength gains, but not aerobic capacity changes, mediate the cognitive benefits of PRT.

    "abstract": "We study the thermodynamic stability of the native state of the human prion protein using a new free-energy method, replica-exchange on-the-fly parameterization. This method is designed to overcome hidden-variable sampling limitations to yield nearly error-free free-energy profiles along a conformational coordinate. We confirm that all four (M129V, D178N) polymorphs have a ground-state conformation with three intact beta-sheet hydrogen bonds. Additionally, they are observed to have distinct metastabilities determined by the side-chain at position 129. We rationalize these findings with reference to the prion \"strain\" hypothesis, which links the variety of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy phenotypes to conformationally distinct infectious prion forms and classifies distinct phenotypes of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease based solely on the 129 polymorphism. Because such metastable structures are not easily observed in structural experiments, our approach could potentially provide new insights into the conformational origins of prion diseases and other pathologies arising from protein misfolding and aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder linked to oligomerization and fibrillization of amyloid beta peptides, with Abeta1-42 being the most aggregative and neurotoxic one. We report herein the synthesis and conformational analysis of Abeta1-42-amyloid related beta-hairpin peptidomimetics, built on a piperidine-pyrrolidine semi rigid beta-turn inducer and bearing two small recognition peptide sequences, designed on oligomeric and fibril structures of Abeta1-42. According to these peptide sequences, a stable beta-hairpin or a dynamic equilibrium between two possible architectures was observed. These original constructs are able to greatly delay the kinetics of Abeta1-42 aggregation process as demonstrated by thioflavin-T fluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy. Capillary electrophoresis indicates their ability to preserve the monomer species, inhibiting the formation of toxic oligomers. Furthermore, compounds protect against toxic effects of Abeta on neuroblastoma cells even at substoichiometric concentrations. This study is the first example of acyclic small beta-hairpin mimics possessing such a highly efficient anti-aggregation activity. The protective effect is more pronounced than that observed with molecules which have undergone clinical trials. The structural elements made in this study provide valuable insights in the understanding of the aggregation process and insights to explore the design of novel acyclic beta-hairpin targeting other types of amyloid-forming proteins.",

However, it has been challenging to discover potent agents in order to inhibit Abeta fibrillation. Herein, we demonstrated the effect of resorcinarene on inhibiting Abeta fibrillation in vitro via experimental and computational methods. Abeta were incubated with different concentrations of resorcinarene so as to monitor the kinetics by using thioflavin T binding assay. The results, which were further confirmed by far-UV CD spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy, strongly indicated that the higher concentration of resorcinarene, the more effective the inhibition of Abeta fibrillation. A cytotoxicity study showed that when sea urchin embryos were exposed to the resorcinarene, the majority survived due to the resorcinarene low toxicity. In addition, when the resorcinarene was added, the formation of toxic Abeta 42 species was delayed. Computational studies of Abeta fibrillation, including docking simulations and MD simulations, illustrated that the interaction between inhibitor resorcinarene and Abeta is driven by the non-polar interactions. These studies display a novel strategy for the exploration of promising antiamyloiddogenic agents for AD treatments.",

    "title": "Kinetics of spontaneous filament nucleation via oligomers: Insights from theory and simulation.",
    "abstract": "Nucleation processes are at the heart of a large number of phenomena, from cloud formation to protein crystallization. A recently emerging area where nucleation is highly relevant is the initiation of filamentous protein self-assembly, a process that has broad implications in many research areas ranging from medicine to nanotechnology. As such, spontaneous nucleation of protein fibrils has received much attention in recent years with many theoretical and experimental studies focussing on the underlying physical principles. In this paper we make a step forward in this direction and explore the early time behaviour of filamentous protein growth in the context of nucleation theory. We first provide an overview of the thermodynamics and kinetics of spontaneous nucleation of protein filaments in the presence of one relevant degree of freedom, namely the cluster size. In this case, we review how key kinetic observables, such as the reaction order of spontaneous nucleation, are directly related to the physical size of the critical nucleus. We then focus on the increasingly prominent case of filament nucleation that includes a conformational conversion of the nucleating building-block as an additional slow step in the nucleation process. Using computer simulations, we study the concentration dependence of the nucleation rate. We find that, under these circumstances, the reaction order of spontaneous nucleation with respect to the free monomer does no longer relate to the overall physical size of the nucleating aggregate but rather to the portion of the aggregate that actively participates in the conformational conversion. Our results thus provide a novel interpretation of the common kinetic descriptors of protein filament formation, including the reaction order of the nucleation step or the scaling exponent of lag times, and put into perspective current theoretical descriptions of protein aggregation.",

The drugs leptin and pioglitazone have previously been shown individually to have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory actions, respectively, in animal models. METHODS: We studied the impact of combined leptin and pioglitazone treatment in 6-month-old APP/PS1 (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) transgenic AD mouse model. RESULTS: We report that an acute 2-week treatment with combined leptin and pioglitazone resulted in a reduction of spatial memory deficits (Y maze) and brain beta-amyloid levels (soluble beta-amyloid and amyloid plaque burden) relative to vehicle-treated animals. Combination treatment was also associated with amelioration in plaque-associated neuritic pathology and synapse loss, and also a significantly reduced neocortical glial response. DISCUSSION: Combination therapy with leptin and pioglitazone ameliorates pathologic changes in APP/PS1 mice and may represent a potential treatment approach for AD.",

We have developed a new method for an oligomeric Abeta-specific AD vaccination using polymer micelle-encapsulated peptide fragments, which overcome many problems of vaccination associated with the direct use of the Abeta1-42 peptide. We studied different encapsulated forms of shortened Abeta peptides with and without the entire T cell epitope in an APP/PS1 mouse model. After two inoculations with encapsulated Abeta fragments, antibodies were produced in all mice with antibody titer greater than 1:12,800. No anti-polymer antibodies were detected after five inoculations, and none of the injected mice showed any adverse effects throughout experimentation. Anti-Abeta antibodies from our polymer-encapsulated vaccine were able to bind to A plaques in the brain of our mice, and were able to specifically recognize oligomeric Abeta. Our results suggest that the safety and efficacy issues previously encountered in other Abeta vaccination trials may be successfully addressed by using micelle-encapsulated peptides. These shorter Abeta fragments are also easier to synthesize and more cost-effective than the highly hydrophobic full-length Abeta1-42 peptide.",

    "abstract": "The formation of beta amyloid (Abeta) plaques in specific brain regions is one of the early pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To enable the early detection of AD and related applications, a method for real-time, clear 3D visualization of Abeta plaques in vivo is highly desirable. Two-photon microscopy (TPM) which utilizes two near-infrared photons is an attractive tool for such applications. However, this technique needs a sensitive and photostable two-photon (TP) probe possessing bright TP exited fluorescence to impart high signal-to-noise (S/N) visualization of Abeta plaques. Herein, we report a quadrupolar TP fluorescent probe (QAD1) having large TP action cross section (Phideltamax = 420 GM) and its application for in vivo TPM imaging of Abeta plaques. This probe, designed with a centrosymmetric D-A-D motif with a cyclic conjugating bridge and solubilizing unit, displays bright TP excited fluorescence, appreciable water solubility, robust photostability, and high sensitivity and selectivity for Abeta plaques. Using the real-time TPM imaging of transgenic 5XFAD mice after intravenous injection of QAD1, we show that this probe readily enters the blood brain barrier and provides high S/N ratio images of individual Abeta plaques in vivo. We also used QAD1 in dual-color TPM imaging for 3D visualization of Abeta plaques along with blood vessels and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) inside living mouse brains. These findings demonstrate that this probe will be useful in biomedical applications including early diagnosis and treatments of AD.",

    "title": "Amyloid Beta Aggregation in the Presence of Temperature-Sensitive Polymers.",
    "abstract": "The formation of amyloid fibrils is considered to be one of the main causes for many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or Huntington's disease. Current knowledge suggests that amyloid-aggregation represents a nucleation-dependent aggregation process in vitro, where a sigmoidal growth phase follows an induction period. Here, we studied the fibrillation of amyloid beta 1-40 (Abeta40) in the presence of thermoresponsive polymers, expected to alter the Abeta40 fibrillation kinetics due to their lower critical solution behavior. To probe the influence of molecular weight and the end groups of the polymer on its lower critical solution temperature (LCST), also considering its concentration dependence in the presence of buffer-salts needed for the aggregation studies of the amyloids, poly(oxazolines) (POx) with LCSTs ranging from 14.2-49.8  C and poly(methoxy di(ethylene glycol)acrylates) with LCSTs ranging from 34.4-52.7  C were synthesized. The two different polymers allowed the comparison of the influence of different molecular structures onto the fibrillation process. Mixtures of Abeta40 with these polymers in varying concentrations were studied via time-dependent measurements of the thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence. The studies revealed that amyloid fibrillation was accelerated in, accompanied by an extension of the lag phase of Abeta40 fibrillation from 18.3 h in the absence to 19.3 h in the presence of the poly(methoxy di(ethylene glycol)acrylate) (3600 g/mol).",
