    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests associations between cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). White matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin (WMHs) are increased in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, but the exact pathomechanistic link is unknown. The current study investigated effects of amyloid dysmetabolism on the microstructure of WMHs in subjects with MCI or subjective cognitive decline (N = 51), dichotomized according to pathological or normal levels of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta42) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Thirty-one subjects with low CSF Abeta42 (Abeta+) and 20 subjects with normal CSF Abeta42 (Abeta-) were assessed with magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (DR), axial diffusivity (DA), and mean diffusivity (MD) were determined. There were no significant differences in WMH volume or distribution between the groups, and neither age nor WMH volume had significant impact on the DTI indices. Nevertheless, there were significantly higher DA, DR, and MD in WMHs in Abeta+ relative to Abeta-; however, no differences in FA were found. The present results suggest that amyloid accumulation is associated with impaired structural integrity (e.g. relating to more extensive demyelination and loss of axons) in WMHs putatively adding to effects of ischemia.",

    "title": "Reversal of Beta-Amyloid-Induced Neurotoxicity in PC12 Cells by Curcumin, the Important Role of ROS-Mediated Signaling and ERK Pathway.",
    "abstract": "Progressive accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) will form the senile plaques and cause oxidative damage and neuronal cell death, which was accepted as the major pathological mechanism to the Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, inhibition of Abeta-induced oxidative damage and neuronal cell apoptosis by agents with potential antioxidant properties represents one of the most effective strategies in combating human AD. Curcumin (Cur) a natural extraction from curcuma longa has potential of pharmacological efficacy, including the benefit to antagonize Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. However, the molecular mechanism remains elusive. The present study evaluated the protective effect of Cur against Abeta-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in PC12 cells and investigated the underlying mechanism. The results showed that Cur markedly reduced Abeta-induced cytotoxicity by inhibition of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis through regulation of Bcl-2 family. The PARP cleavage, caspases activation, and ROS-mediated DNA damage induced by Abeta were all significantly blocked by Cur. Moreover, regulation of p38 MAPK and AKT pathways both contributed to this protective potency. Our findings suggested that Cur could effectively suppress Abeta-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis by inhibition of ROS-mediated oxidative damage and regulation of ERK pathway, which validated its therapeutic potential in chemoprevention and chemotherapy of Abeta-induced neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to test the interaction between amyloid-beta and tau proteins as a determinant of metabolic decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). We assessed 120 cognitively normal individuals with [18F]florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements at baseline, as well as [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) PET at baseline and at 24 months. A voxel-based interaction model was built to test the associations between continuous measurements of CSF biomarkers, [18F]florbetapir and [18F]FDG standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR). We found that the synergistic interaction between [18F]florbetapir SUVR and CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) measurements, rather than the sum of their independent effects, was associated with a 24-month metabolic decline in basal and mesial temporal, orbitofrontal, and anterior and posterior cingulate cortices (P<0.001). In contrast, interactions using CSF amyloid-beta1-42 and total tau biomarkers did not associate with metabolic decline over a time frame of 24 months. The interaction found in this study further support the framework that amyloid-beta and hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates synergistically interact to cause downstream AD neurodegeneration. In fact, the regions displaying the metabolic decline reported here were confined to brain networks affected early by amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Preventive clinical trials may benefit from using a combination of amyloid-beta PET and p-tau biomarkers to enrich study populations of cognitively normal subjects with a high probability of disease progression in studies, using [18F]FDG as a biomarker of efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The lack of strong association between brain beta-amyloid deposition and cognitive impairment has been a challenge for the Alzheimer's disease (AD) field. Although beta-amyloid is necessary for the pathologic diagnosis of AD, it is not sufficient to make the pathologic diagnosis or cause dementia. We sought to identify the genetic modifiers of the relation between cortical beta-amyloid burden (measured using [18F]Florbetapir-PET) and cognitive dysfunction (measured using ADAS-cog) by conducting a genome-wide interaction study on baseline data from participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) phases GO/2 (n=678). Near genome-wide significant interaction effect was observed for rs73069071 within the IAPP (amylin) and SLCO1A2 genes (P=6.2 x 10-8). Congruent results were found using data from participants followed up from ADNI-1 (Pone-tailed=0.028, n=165). Meta-analysis across ADNI-GO/2 and ADNI-1 revealed a genome-wide significant interaction effect (P=1.1 x 10-8). Our results were further supported by similar interaction effects on temporal lobe cortical thickness (whole-brain voxelwise analysis: familywise error corrected P=0.013) and longitudinal changes in ADAS-cog score and left middle temporal thickness and amygdalar volume (Pone-tailed=0.026, 0.019 and 0.003, respectively). Using postmortem beta-amyloid immunohistochemistry data from 243 AD participants in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project, we also observed similar rs73069071-by-beta-amyloid deposition interaction effect on global cognitive function (Pone-tailed=0.005). Our findings provide insight into the complexity of the relationship between beta-amyloid burden and AD-related cognitive impairment. Although functional studies are required to elucidate the role of rs73069071 in AD pathophysiology, our results support the recently growing evidence on the role of amylin in AD.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological and genetic studies have identified metabolic disorders and inflammation as risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Evidence in obesity and type-2 diabetes suggests a role for a metabolic inflammasome (\"metaflammasome\") in mediating chronic inflammation in peripheral organs implicating IKKbeta (inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta), IRS1 (insulin receptor substrate 1), JNK (c-jun N-terminal kinase), and PKR (double-stranded RNA protein kinase). We hypothesized that these proteins are expressed in the brain in response to metabolic risk factors in AD. Neocortex from 299 participants from the MRC Cognitive Function and Ageing Studies was analysed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of the phosphorylated (active) form of IKKbeta [pSer176/180 ], IRS1 [pS312 ], JNK [pThr183 /Tyr185 ] and PKR [pT451 ]. The data were analyzed to investigate whether the proteins were expressed together and in relation with metabolic disorders, dementia, Alzheimer's pathology and APOE genotype. We observed a change from a positive to a negative association between the proteins and hypertension according to the dementia status. Type-2 diabetes was negatively related with the proteins among participants without dementia; whereas participants with dementia and AD pathology showed a positive association with JNK. A significant association between IKKbeta and JNK in participants with dementia and AD pathology was observed, but not in those without dementia. Otherwise, weak to moderate associations were observed among the protein loads. The presence of dementia was significantly associated with JNK and negatively associated with IKKbeta and IRS1. Cognitive scores showed a significant positive relationship with IKKbeta and a negative with IRS1, JNK and PKR. The proteins were significantly associated with pathology in Alzheimer's participants with the relationship being inverse or not significant in participants without dementia. Expression of the proteins was not related to APOE genotype. These findings highlight a role for these proteins in AD pathophysiology but not necessarily as a complex.",

Participants (N=129) took part in clinical assessments, a driving test, and positron emission tomography imaging with Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection. General linear models tested whether the number of driving errors differed as a function of each of the biomarker variables (mean cortical binding potential for PIB, and CSF Abeta42, tau, ptau181, tau/Abeta42, ptau181/Abeta42). Higher ratios of CSF tau/Abeta42, ptau181/Abeta42, and PIB mean cortical binding potential, were associated with more driving errors (P<0.05).

    "abstract": "The 42 amino acid form of amyloid beta (Abeta1-42) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been widely accepted as a central biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. Several immunoassays for CSF Abeta1-42 are commercially available, but can suffer from between laboratory and batch-to-batch variability as well as lack of standardisation across assays. As a consequence, no general cut-off values have been established for a specific context of use (e.g., clinical diagnostics) and selection of individuals for enrolment in clinical trials (patient stratification) remains challenging. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) has initiated a working group for CSF proteins (WG-CSF) to facilitate standardisation of CSF Abeta1-42 measurement results. The efforts of the IFCC WG-CSF include the development of certified reference materials (CRMs) and reference measurement procedures (RMPs) for key biomarkers. Two candidate RMPs for quantification of Abeta1-42 in CSF based on liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry have been developed and tested in two ring trials. Furthermore, two commutability studies including native CSF pools, artificial CSF and spiked materials have been completed. On the basis of these studies, human CSF pools containing only endogenous Abeta1-42 at three concentrations were selected as the format for future CRMs that are now being processed.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of sleep/wake activity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients significantly affects their quality of life and that of their caretakers and is a major contributing factor for institutionalization. Levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta) have been shown to be regulated by neuronal activity and to correlate with the sleep/wake cycle. Whether consolidated sleep can be disrupted by Abeta alone is not well understood. We hypothesize that Abeta42 can increase wakefulness and disrupt consolidated sleep. Here we report that flies expressing the human Abeta42 transgene in neurons have significantly reduced consolidated sleep compared with control flies. Fatty acid binding proteins (Fabp) are small hydrophobic ligand carriers that have been clinically implicated in AD. Abeta42 flies that carry a transgene of either the Drosophila Fabp or the mammalian brain-type Fabp show a significant increase in nighttime sleep and long consolidated sleep bouts, rescuing the Abeta42-induced sleep disruption. These studies suggest that alterations in Fabp levels and/or activity may be associated with sleep disturbances in AD. Future work to determine the molecular mechanisms that contribute to Fabp-mediated rescue of Abeta42-induced sleep loss will be important for the development of therapeutics in the treatment of AD.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "title": "Association between naturally occurring anti-amyloid beta autoantibodies and medial temporal lobe atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Naturally occurring autoantibodies against amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide exist in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of healthy individuals. Recently, it was reported that administration of intravenous immunoglobulin at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) reduces brain atrophy. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between naturally occurring anti-Abeta autoantibodies and brain atrophy in patients with cognitive impairment. METHODS: Serum and CSF levels of anti-Abeta autoantibodies and CSF biomarkers were evaluated in 68 patients with cognitive impairment, comprising 44 patients with AD, 19 patients with amnestic MCI and five patients with non-Alzheimer's dementia. The degree of brain atrophy was assessed using the voxel-based specific regional analysis system for AD, which targets the volume of interest (VOI) in medial temporal structures, including the whole hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and amygdala. RESULTS: CSF levels of anti-Abeta autoantibodies were inversely correlated with the extent and severity of VOI atrophy, and the ratio of VOI/grey matter atrophy in patients with AD, but not in MCI or non-AD patients. Serum levels of anti-Abeta autoantibodies were not associated with these parameters in any of the patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that CSF levels of naturally occurring anti-Abeta autoantibodies are inversely associated with the degree of the VOI atrophy in patients with AD. Although the mechanism is unclear, CSF levels of naturally occurring anti-Abeta autoantibodies may be implicated in the progression of atrophy of the whole hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and amygdala, in AD.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to severe stress following stroke is recognised to complicate the recovery process. We have identified that stress can exacerbate the severity of post-stroke secondary neurodegeneration in the thalamus. In this study, we investigated whether exposure to stress could influence the accumulation of the neurotoxic protein Amyloid-beta. Using an experimental model of focal cortical ischemia in adult mice combined with exposure to chronic restraint stress, we examined changes within the contra- and ipsilateral thalamus at six weeks post-stroke using Western blotting and immunohistochemical approaches. Western blotting analysis indicated that stroke was associated with a significant enhancement of the 25 and 50 kDa oligomers within the ipsilateral hemisphere and the 20 kDa oligomer within the contralateral hemisphere. Stroked animals exposed to stress exhibited an additional increase in multiple forms of Amyloid-beta oligomers. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed that stroke was associated with a significant accumulation of Amyloid-beta within the thalami of both hemispheres, an effect that was exacerbated in stroke animals exposed to stress. Given that Amyloid-beta oligomers, most notably the 30-40 and 50 kDa oligomers, are recognised to correlate with accelerated cognitive decline, our results suggest that monitoring stress levels in patients recovering from stroke may merit consideration in the future.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of glutamate homeostasis in the interstitial fluid of the brain is strongly implicated in causing synaptic dysfunction in many neurological and psychiatric illnesses. In the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid beta (Abeta)-mediated disruption of synaptic plasticity and memory can be alleviated by interventions that directly remove glutamate or block certain glutamate receptors. An alternative strategy is to facilitate the removal of excess glutamate from the nervous system by activating peripheral glutamate clearance systems. One such blood-based system, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), is activated by oxaloacetate, which acts as a co-substrate. We report here that synthetic and AD brain-derived Abeta-mediated inhibition of synaptic long-term potentiation in the hippocampus is alleviated by oxaloacetate. Moreover the effect of oxaloacetate was GOT-dependent. The disruptive effects of a general inhibitor of excitatory amino acid transport or TNFalpha, a pro-inflammatory mediator of Abeta action, were also reversed by oxaloacetate. Furthermore, another intervention that increases peripheral glutamate clearance, peritoneal dialysis, mimicked the beneficial effect of oxaloacetate. These findings lend support to the promotion of the peripheral clearance of glutamate as a means to alleviate synaptic dysfunction that is caused by impaired glutamate homeostasis in the brain.",

    "abstract": "A high co-morbidity between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression suggests there might be similar mechanisms underlying the course of these diseases. Previous studies have shown that p38MAPK plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of AD and depression. However, little is known about whether SB203580, a selective inhibitor of p38MAPK, may protect against AD-associated cognitive impairments and depression-like behavior, simultaneously. Herein, we have shown, for the first time, that SB203580 may reverse memory impairments and depression-like behavior induced by hippocampal infusion of beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42), as measured by novel object recognition, Morris water maze, tail-suspension and forced-swimming tests. In addition, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a PKC activator which also activates p38MAPK, significantly abolished the effects of SB203580. Moreover, Abeta1-42 causes increased phosphorylation of p38MAPK and decreased phosphorylation of Ser9-glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus of mice, which could be significantly reversed by SB203580. Our results suggest that SB203580 reversed Abeta1-42-induced cognitive impairments and depression-like behavior via inhibiting p38MAPK signaling pathway, which not only supports p38MAPK as a therapeutic target for AD-associated cognitive dysfunction and depression-like behavior, but also provides experimental basis for the use of SB203580 in co-morbidity of AD and depression.",

RESULTS: DLB had higher WMH volume compared to CN, and WMH volume was higher in the occipital and posterior periventricular regions in DLB compared to AD. Higher WMH volume was associated with history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes but not with clinical disease severity in DLB. Frequency of infarcts in DLB was not different from CN and AD dementia. DISCUSSION: In DLB, WMH volume is higher than AD and CN and appears to be primarily associated with history of vascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, progressive neurological disorder characterized by the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques composed of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta), the key component in pathogenesis of AD. Peripheral administration of enoxaparin (ENO) reportedly reduces the level of Abeta and the amyloid plaques in the cortex of amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. However, the exact mechanism of these effects is unclear. Our previous studies indicated that ENO can inhibit APP processing to Abeta in primary cortical cells from Tg2576 mice by downregulating BACE1 levels. This study examines whether ENO-induced reduction of amyloid load is due to the decreased APP processing to Abeta in Tg2576 mice. Surprisingly, our results indicated that ENO significantly increases the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio in cortex and enhances the amyloid plaque load in both cortex and hippocampus, although overall APP processing was not influenced by ENO. Moreover, ENO stimulated the aggregation of both Abeta40 and Abeta42 in vitro. Although ENO has been reported to improve cognition in vivo and has potential as a therapeutic agent for AD, the results from our study suggest that ENO can exacerbate the amyloid pathology, and the strategy of using ENO for the treatment of AD may require further assessment.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) are the primary conduits of excitatory synaptic transmission. AMPARs are predominantly Ca2+-impermeable in the matured excitatory synapse, except under certain circumstances. Growing evidence implicates the Ca2+ permeability of AMPARs in the regulation of long-term synaptic plasticity and in the pathophysiology of several neurological disorders. Therefore, the Ca2+ conductance of AMPARs may have both physiological and pathological roles at synapses. However, our understanding of the role of Ca2+ permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) in Alzheimer's disease is limited. Here we discuss insights into the potential CP-AMPAR mediated pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, including: 1. Ca2+-mediated aberrant regulation of synapse weakening mechanisms, and 2. neuronal network dysfunction in the brain. Consideration of CP-AMPARs as primary drivers of pathophysiology could help in understanding synaptopathologies, and highlights the potential of CP-AMPARs as therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neuropathologically characterized by neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Progression of both plaques and tangles throughout the brain follows a hierarchical distribution which is defined by intrinsic cytoarchitectonic features and extrinsic connectivity patterns. What has less well been studied is how cortical convolutions influence the distribution of AD pathology. Here, the distribution of both plaques and tangles within subsulcal gyral components (fundi) to components forming their top regions at the subarachnoidal brain surface (crowns) by stereological methods in seven different cortical areas was systematically compared. Further, principle differences in cytoarchitectonic organization of cortical crowns and fundi that might provide the background for regionally selective vulnerability were attempted to identify. It was shown that both plaques and tangles were more prominent in sulcal fundi than gyri crowns. The differential distribution of pathology along convolutions corresponds to subgyral differences in the vascular network, GFAP-positive astrocytes and intracortical and subcortical connectivity. While the precise mechanisms accounting for these differences remain open, the presence of systematic inhomogeneities in the distribution of AD pathology along cortical convolutions indicates that the phylogenetic shaping of the cortex is associated with features that render the human brain vulnerable to AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) and hyperphosphorylated tau are hallmark lesions of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the loss of synapses and dysfunctions of neurotransmission are more directly tied to disease severity. The role of these lesions in the pathoetiological progression of the disease remains contested. Biochemical, cellular, molecular, and pathological studies provided several lines of evidence and improved our understanding of how Abeta and hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation may directly harm synapses and alter neurotransmission. In vitro evidence suggests that Abeta and hyperphosphorylated tau have both direct and indirect cytotoxic effects that affect neurotransmission, axonal transport, signaling cascades, organelle function, and immune response in ways that lead to synaptic loss and dysfunctions in neurotransmitter release. Observations in preclinical models and autopsy studies support these findings, suggesting that while the pathoetiology of positive lesions remains elusive, their removal may reduce disease severity and progression. The purpose of this article is to highlight the need for further investigation of the role of tau in disease progression and its interactions with Abeta and neurotransmitters alike.",

    "title": "Lumbar Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers of Posthemorrhagic Hydrocephalus of Prematurity: Amyloid Precursor Protein, Soluble Amyloid Precursor Protein alpha, and L1 Cell Adhesion Molecule.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is the most frequent, severe neurological complication of prematurity and is associated with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) in up to half of cases. PHH requires lifelong neurosurgical care and is associated with significant cognitive and psychomotor disability. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers may provide both diagnostic information for PHH and novel insights into its pathophysiology. OBJECTIVE: To explore the diagnostic ability of candidate CSF biomarkers for PHH. METHODS: Concentrations of amyloid precursor protein (APP), soluble APPalpha (sAPPalpha), soluble APPbeta, neural cell adhesion molecule-1 (NCAM-1), L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), tau, phosphorylated tau, and total protein (TP) were measured in lumbar CSF from neonates in 6 groups: (1) no known neurological disease (n = 33); (2) IVH grades I to II (n = 13); (3) IVH grades III to IV (n = 12); (4) PHH (n = 12); (5) ventricular enlargement without hydrocephalus (n = 10); and (6) hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (n = 13). CSF protein levels were compared using analysis of variance, and logistic regression was performed to examine the predictive ability of each marker for PHH. RESULTS: Lumbar CSF levels of APP, sAPPalpha, L1CAM, and TP were selectively increased in PHH compared with all other conditions (all P < .001). The sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratios of candidate CSF biomarkers for PHH were determined for APP, sAPPalpha, and L1CAM; cut points of 699, 514, and 113 ng/mL yielded odds ratios for PHH of 80.0, 200.0, and 68.75, respectively. CONCLUSION: Lumbar CSF APP, sAPPalpha, L1CAM, and TP were selectively increased in PHH. These proteins, and sAPPalpha, in particular, hold promise as biomarkers of PHH and provide novel insight into PHH-associated neural injury and repair.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative measurements of change in beta-amyloid load from Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images play a critical role in clinical trials and longitudinal observational studies of Alzheimer's disease. These measurements are strongly affected by methodological differences between implementations, including choice of reference region and use of partial volume correction, but there is a lack of consensus for an optimal method. Previous works have examined some relevant variables under varying criteria, but interactions between them prevent choosing a method via combined meta-analysis. In this work, we present a thorough comparison of methods to measure change in beta-amyloid over time using Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET imaging. METHODS: We compare 1,024 different automated software pipeline implementations with varying methodological choices according to four quality metrics calculated over three-timepoint longitudinal trajectories of 129 subjects: reliability (straightness/variance); plausibility (lack of negative slopes); ability to predict accumulator/non-accumulator status from baseline value; and correlation between change in beta-amyloid and change in Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: From this analysis, we show that an optimal longitudinal measure of beta-amyloid from PiB should use a reference region that includes a combination of voxels in the supratentorial white matter and those in the whole cerebellum, measured using two-class partial volume correction in the voxel space of each subject's corresponding anatomical MR image.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic dysfunctions and altered neuronal activity play major role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), with underlying mechanisms largely unknown. We report that in the prefrontal cortex of amyloid precursor protein-presenilin 1 and APP23 AD mice, baseline activity of pyramidal cells is disrupted by episodes of paroxysmal hyperactivity. Induced by spontaneous EPSC bursts, these incidents are prevalent in neurons proximal to amyloid plaques and involve enhanced activity of glutamate with metabotropic effects. Abolition of EPSC bursts by tetrodotoxin and SERCA ATPase blockers thapsigargin or cyclopiasonic acid suggests their presynaptic origin and sensitized store-released calcium. Accordingly, the rate of EPSC bursts activated by single axon stimulation is enhanced. Aggravation of the hyperactivity by blockers of excitatory amino acid transporter (+-)-HIP-A and DL-TBOA together with histochemical and ultrastructural evidence for enrichment of plaque-related dystrophies with synaptic vesicles and SNARE protein SNAP-25 infer the later as hot-spots for ectopic release of glutamate. Inhibition of EPSC bursts by I/II mGluR1 blocker MCPG or selective mGluR1 antagonist LY367385 implicate metabotropic glutamatergic effects in generation of paroxysmal bursts. These findings demonstrate for the first time that at amyloid plaques, enhanced activity of nonsynaptic glutamate can promote irregular EPSC bursts with hyperactivity of pyramidal cells via mGluR1 receptors.",

    "abstract": "Rationale Cerebral microbleeds seen on brain magnetic resonance imaging are markers of small vessel disease, linked to cognitive dysfunction and increased ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke risk. Observational studies suggest that aspirin use may induce cerebral microbleeds, and associated overt intracranial hemorrhage, but this has not been definitively resolved. Aims ASPREE-NEURO will determine the effect of aspirin on cerebral microbleed development over three years in healthy adults aged 70 years and over, participating in the larger 'ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE)' primary prevention study of aspirin. Sample size Five hundred and fifty-nine participants provide 75% power (two-sided p value of 0.05) to determine an average difference of 0.5 cerebral microbleed per person after three years. Methods and design A multi-center, randomized placebo-controlled trial of 100 mg daily aspirin in participants who have brain magnetic resonance imaging at study entry, one and three years after randomization and who undergo cognitive testing at the same time points. Study outcomes The primary outcome is the number of new cerebral microbleeds on magnetic resonance imaging after three years. Secondary outcomes are the number of new cerebral microbleeds after one year, change in volume of white matter hyperintensity, cognitive function, and stroke. Discussion ASPREE-NEURO will resolve whether aspirin affects the presence and number of cerebral microbleeds, their relationship with cognitive performance, and indicate whether consideration of cerebral microbleeds alters the risk-benefit profile of aspirin in primary prevention for older people.

    "abstract": "Amyloid plaques, although inducing damage to the immediately surrounding neuropil, have been proposed to provide a relatively innocuous way to deposit toxic soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) species. Here we address this hypothesis by exploring spread and absorption of fluorescent Abeta to pre-existing amyloid plaques after local application in wild-type mice versus APP/PS1 transgenic mice with amyloid plaques. Local intracortical or intracerebroventricular injection of fluorescently-labeled Abeta in APP/PS1 mice with a high plaque density resulted in preferential accumulation of the peptide in amyloid plaques in both conventional postmortem histology and in live imaging using two-photon microscopy. These findings support the contention that amyloid plaques may act as buffers to protect neurons from the toxic effects of momentary high concentrations of soluble Abeta oligomers.",

    "abstract": "Abeta deposition is a driving force of Alzheimer's disease pathology and can be detected early by amyloid positron emission tomography. Identifying presymptomatic structural brain changes associated with Abeta deposition might lead to a better understanding of its consequences and provide early diagnostic information. In this respect we analyzed measures of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes along with hippocampal, thalamic and striatal shape and surface area by applying novel analysis strategies for structural magnetic resonance imaging. We included 69 cognitively normal elderly subjects after careful clinical and neuropsychological workup. Standardized uptake value ratios (cerebellar reference) for uptake of 11-C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) were calculated from positron emission tomographic data for a cortical measurement and for bilateral hippocampus, thalamus and striatum. Associations to shape, surface area, volume and cortical thickness were tested using regression models that included significant predictors as covariates. Left anterior hippocampal shape was associated with regional PiB uptake (P < 0.05, FDR corrected), whereas volumes of the hippocampi and their subregions were not associated with cortical or regional PiB uptake (all P > 0.05, FDR corrected). Within the entorhinal cortical region of both hemispheres, thickness was negatively associated with cortical PiB uptake (P < 0.05, FDR corrected). Hence, localized shape measures and cortical thickness may be potential biomarkers of presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "The cerebral accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) is one of the key pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is also found in bodily fluids such as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. However, the significance of Abeta accumulation in the brain and different bodily pools, as well as its correlation with aging and cerebral amyloid pathology, is not completely understood. To better understand this question, we selected the rhesus monkey, which is phylogenetically and physiologically highly similar to the human, as a model to study. We quantified the levels of the two main Abeta isoforms (Abeta42 and Abeta40) in different sections of the brain (frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and hippocampus) and bodily fluids (CSF and plasma) of rhesus monkeys at different developmental phases (young, 5-9 years of age; mature, 10-19 years of age; and old, 21-24 years of age). We found that the levels of neuronal and insoluble Abeta42 increased significantly in the brain with aging, suggesting that this specific isoform might be directly involved in aging and AD-like pathophysiology. There was no significant change in the Abeta40 level in the brain with aging. In addition, the Abeta42 level, but not the Abeta40 level, in both the CSF and plasma increased with aging. We also identified a positive correlation between Abeta42 in the CSF and plasma and Abeta42 in the brain. Taken collectively, our results indicate that there is an association between Abeta accumulation and age. These results support the increased incidence of AD with aging.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta), Abeta40, Abeta42, and, recently, Abeta25-35 have been directly implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We have studied the effects of Abeta on neuronal death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and synaptic assembling in neurons in primary culture. Abeta25-35, Abeta40, and Abeta42 significantly decreased neuronal viability, although Abeta25-35 showed a higher effect. Abeta25-35 showed a more penetrating ability to reach mitochondria while Abeta40 did not enter the neuronal cytosol and Abeta42 was scarcely internalized. We did not observe a direct correlation between ROS production and cell death because both Abeta40 and Abeta42 decreased neuronal viability but Abeta40 did not change ROS production. Rather, ROS production seems to correlate with the penetrating ability of each Abeta. No significant differences were found between Abeta40 and Abeta42 regarding the extent of the deleterious effects of both peptides on neuronal viability or synaptophysin expression. However, Abeta40 elicited a clear delocalization of PSD-95 and synaptotagmin from prospective synapsis to the neuronal soma, suggesting the occurrence of a crucial effect of Abeta40 on synaptic disassembling. The formation of Abeta40- or Abeta42-serum albumin complexes avoided the effects of these peptides on neuronal viability, synaptophysin expression, and PSD-95/synaptotagmin disarrangement suggesting that sequestration of Abeta by albumin prevents deleterious effects of these peptides. We can conclude that Abeta borne by albumin can be safely transported through body fluids, a fact that may be compulsory for Abeta disposal by peripheral tissues.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The clinical relevance of brain beta-amyloidosis in older adults without dementia is not established. As delirium and dementia are strongly related, studies on patients with delirium may give pathophysiological clues. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the Alzheimer's disease (AD) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta42), total tau (T-tau), and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) are associated with delirium in hip fracture patients with and without dementia. METHODS: CSF was collected in conjunction to spinal anesthesia in 129 patients. Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method once daily in all patients, both pre- and postoperatively. The diagnosis of dementia at admission was based upon clinical consensus. CSF levels of Abeta42, T-tau, and P-tau were analyzed. RESULTS: In patients without dementia, we found lower CSF Abeta42 levels (median, 310 ng/L versus 489 ng/L, p = 0.006), higher T-tau levels (median, 505 ng/L versus 351 ng/L, p = 0.02), but no change in P-tau in patients who developed delirium (n = 16) compared to those who remained lucid (n = 49). Delirious patients also had lower ratios of Abeta42 to T-tau (p < 0.001) and P-tau (p = 0.001) relative to those without delirium. CSF Abeta42 and T-tau remained significantly associated with delirium status in adjusted analyses. In patients with dementia, CSF biomarker levels did not differ between those with (n = 54) and without delirium (n = 10). CONCLUSION: The reduction in CSF Abeta42, indicating beta-amyloidosis, and increase in T-tau, indicating neurodegeneration, in hip fracture patients without dementia developing delirium indicates that preclinical AD brain pathology is clinically relevant and possibly plays a role in delirium pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) and amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition often co-exist in (prodromal) dementia, and both types of pathology have been associated with neurodegeneration. We examined whether cSVD and Abeta have independent or interactive effects on hippocampal volume (HV) in a memory clinic population. We included 87 individuals with clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 24), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 26), and subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) (n = 37). cSVD magnetic resonance imaging markers included white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, lacunar infarct presence, and microbleed presence. Abeta pathology was assessed as cerebrospinal fluid-derived Abeta1 - 42 levels and dichotomized into normal or abnormal, and HV was determined by manual volumetric measurements. A linear hierarchical regression approach was applied for the detection of additive or interaction effects between cSVD and Abeta on HV in the total participant group (n = 87) and in the non-demented group (including SCC and MCI individuals only, n = 63). The results revealed that abnormal Abeta and lacunar infarct presence were independently associated with lower HV in the non-demented individuals. Interestingly, Abeta and WMH pathology interacted in the non-demented individuals, such that WMH had a negative effect on HV in individuals with abnormal CSF Abeta42 levels, but not in individuals with normal CSF Abeta42 levels. These associations were not present when individuals with AD were included in the analyses. Our observations suggest that relatively early on in the disease process older individuals with abnormal Abeta levels are at an increased risk of accelerated disease progression when concomitant cSVD is present.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug development is burdened with the current requirement to conduct large, lengthy, and costly trials to overcome uncertainty in patient progression and effect size on treatment outcome measures. There is an urgent need for the discovery, development, and implementation of novel, objectively measured biomarkers for AD that would aid selection of the appropriate subpopulation of patients in clinical trials, and presumably, improve the likelihood of successfully evaluating innovative treatment options. Amyloid deposition and tau in the brain, which are most commonly assessed either in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or by molecular imaging, are consistently and widely accepted. Nonetheless, a clear gap still exists in the accurate identification of subjects that truly have the hallmarks of AD. The Coalition Against Major Diseases (CAMD), one of 12 consortia of the Critical Path Institute (C-Path), aims to streamline drug development for AD and related dementias by advancing regulatory approved drug development tools for clinical trials through precompetitive data sharing and adoption of consensus clinical data standards. This report focuses on the regulatory process for biomarker qualification, briefly comments on how it contrasts with approval or clearance of companion diagnostics, details the qualifications currently available to the field of AD, and highlights the current challenges facing the landscape of CSF biomarkers qualified as hallmarks of AD. Finally, it recommends actions to accelerate regulatory qualification of CSF biomarkers that would, in turn, improve the efficiency of AD therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation and activation of innate immunity are early events in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, a rare mutation in the gene Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) has been associated with a substantial increase in the risk of developing late onset AD. To uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying this association, we investigated the RNA and protein expression of TREM2 in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Our findings suggest that TREM2 not only plays a critical role in inflammation, but is also involved in neuronal cell survival and in neurogenesis. We have shown that TREM2 is a soluble protein transported by macrophages through ventricle walls and choroid plexus, and then enters the brain parenchyma via radial glial cells. TREM2 protein is essential for neuroplasticity and myelination. During the late stages of life, a lack of TREM2 protein may accelerate aging processes and neuronal cell loss and reduce microglial activity, ultimately leading to neuroinflammation. As inflammation plays a major role in neurodegenerative diseases, a lack of TREM2 could be a missing link between immunomodulation and neuroprotection.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The immune system is increasingly mentioned as a potential target for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. OBJECTIVE: In the present pilot study, the effect of (neuro)inflammation on amyloidopathy was investigated in the marmoset monkey, which has potential as an AD animal model due to its natural cerebral amyloidosis similar to humans. METHODS: Six adult/aged marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were intracranial injected with amyloid-beta (Abeta) fibrils at three cortical locations in the right hemisphere. Additionally, in half of the monkeys, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was co-injected with the Abeta fibrils and injected in the other hemisphere without Abeta fibrils. The other three monkeys received phosphate buffered saline instead of LPS, as a control for the inflammatory state. The effect of inflammation on amyloidopathy was also investigated in an additional monkey that suffered from chronic inflammatory wasting syndrome. Mirror histology sections were analyzed to assess amyloidopathy and immune reaction, and peripheral blood for AD biomarker expression. RESULTS: All LPS-injected monkeys showed an early AD immune blood cell expression profile on CD95 and CD45RA. Two out of three monkeys injected with Abeta and LPS and the additional monkey, suffering from chronic inflammation, developed plaques. None of the controls, injected with Abeta only, developed any plaques. CONCLUSION: This study shows the importance of immune modulation on the susceptibility for amyloidosis, a hallmark of AD, which offers new perspectives for disease modifying approaches in AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes are very serious diseases with the latter having been suggested to cause the former. We prepared super-hard rice bread blended with black rice bran (SRBBB), which contained a high amount of resistant starch that showed strong inhibitory activities against beta-secretase and acetylcholinesterase even after heating. Black rice bran showed greater beta-secretase inhibitory activity (3.6-fold) than Koshihikari rice. The bran contained more oleic acid and anthocyanin, meaning that it is potentially a biofunctional food with a high antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, aged mice, which were fed a SRBBB diet for four weeks, showed lower amyloid beta 40 peptide in the blood than mice fed a commercial diet (p < 0.01). Additionally, their initial blood glucose levels (BGLs) after 12 weeks of being fed SRBBB were significantly lower than those in the control group. Taken together, our results indicate SRBBB shows promise for inhibiting not only amyloid beta production, but also abrupt increases in postprandial BGLs.",

METHODS: We examined five methods for determining cut points. RESULTS: The reliable worsening method produced a cut point only for amyloid PET. The specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of cognitively impaired versus young clinically normal (CN) methods labeled the most people abnormal and all gave similar cut points for tau PET, FDG PET, and cortical thickness. Cut points defined using the accuracy of cognitively impaired versus age-matched CN method labeled fewer people abnormal. DISCUSSION: In the future, we will use a single cut point for amyloid PET (standardized uptake value ratio, 1.42; centiloid, 19) based on the reliable worsening cut point method. We will base lenient cut points for tau PET, FDG PET, and cortical thickness on the accuracy of cognitively impaired versus young CN method and base conservative cut points on the accuracy of cognitively impaired versus age-matched CN method.",

Sprague-Dawley male rats were subjected to moderate controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury, and 6 months later euthanized and brain tissues harvested. Results from H&E staining revealed significant 33% and 10% reduction in the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampal CA3 interneurons, increased MHCII-activated inflammatory cells in many gray matter (8-20-fold increase) and white matter (6-30-fold increased) regions of both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, decreased cell cycle regulating protein marker by 1.6- and 1-fold in the SVZ and a 2.3- and 1.5-fold reductions in the ipsilateral and contralateral dentate gyrus, diminution of immature neuronal marker by two- and onefold in both the ipsilateral and contralateral SVZ and dentate gyrus, and amplified amyloid precursor protein (APP) distribution volumes in white matter including corpus callosum, fornix, and internal capsule (4-38-fold increase), as well as in the cortical gray matter, such as the striatum hilus, SVZ, and dentate gyrus (6-40-fold increase) in TBI animals compared to controls (P's < 0.001). Surrogate AD-like phenotypic markers revealed a significant accumulation of phosphorylated tau (AT8) and oligomeric tau (T22) within the neuronal cell bodies in ipsilateral and contralateral cortex, and dentate gyrus relative to sham control, further supporting the rampant neurodegenerative pathology in TBI secondary cell death. These findings indicate that AD-like pathological features may prove to be valuable markers and therapeutic targets for late stage TBI. J. Cell.

The EPAD Scientific Advisory Group for Clinical and Cognitive Outcomes identified appropriate cognitive measures based on a literature search covering both cognitive correlates of preclinical brain changes from imaging studies and cognitive changes observed over time in nondementia population cohorts developing incident dementia. These measures were evaluated according to the following criteria: validity, coherence with biomarker changes, psychometric properties, cross-cultural suitability, availability of alternative forms, and normative data limited practice effects.

    "title": "Characteristics of C-terminal, beta-amyloid peptide binding fragment of neuroprotective protease inhibitor, cystatin C.",
    "abstract": "Cystatin C originally identified as a cysteine proteases inhibitor has a broad spectrum of biological roles ranging from inhibition of extracellular cysteine protease activities, bone resorption, and modulation of inflammatory responses to stimulation of fibroblasts proliferation. There is an increasing number of evidence to suggest that human cystatin C (hCC) might play a protective role in the pathophysiology of sporadic Alzheimer's disease. In vivo and in vitro results well documented the association of hCC with Abeta and the hCC-induced inhibition of Abeta fibril formation. In our earlier work, using a combination of selective proteolytic methods and MS spectroscopy, C-terminal fragment hCC(101-117) was identified as the Abeta-binding region. The fragment of Abeta peptide responsible for the complex formation with hCC was found in the middle, highly hydrophobic part, Abeta(17-24). Structures and affinities of both Abeta and hCC binding sites were characterized by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like assay, by surface plasmon resonance, and by nano-ESI-FTICR MS of the hCC-Abeta-binding peptide complexes. In the in vitro inhibition studies, the binding cystatin sequence, hCC(101-117), revealed the highest relative inhibitory effect toward Abeta-fibril formation. Herein, we present further studies on molecular details of the hCC-Abeta complex. With Ala substitution, affinity experiments, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like assays for the Abeta-binding fragment, hCC(101-117), and its variants, the importance of individual amino acid residues for the protein interaction was evaluated. The results were analyzed using hCC(101-117) nuclear magnetic resonance structural data with molecular dynamics calculations and molecular modeling of the complexes. The results point to conformational requirements and special importance of some amino acid residues for the protein interaction. The obtained results might be helpful for the design of low molecular compounds modulating the biological role of both proteins. Copyright   2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) calls for search of multifunctional compounds as potential candidates for effective therapy. A series of phthalimide and saccharin derivatives linked by different alicyclic fragments (piperazine, hexahydropyrimidine, 3-aminopyrrolidine or 3-aminopiperidine) with phenylalkyl moieties attached have been designed, synthesized, and evaluated as multifunctional anti-AD agents with cholinesterase, beta-secretase and beta-amyloid inhibitory activities. In vitro studies showed that the majority of saccharin derivatives with piperazine moiety and one phthalimide derivative with 3-aminopiperidine fragment exhibited inhibitory potency toward acetylcholinesterase (AChE) with EeAChE IC50 values ranging from 0.83 muM to 19.18 muM. The target compounds displayed inhibition of human beta-secretase-1 (hBACE1) ranging from 26.71% to 61.42% at 50 muM concentration. Among these compounds, two multifunctional agents (26, [2-(2-(4-benzylpiperazin-1-yl)ethyl)benzo[d]isothiazol-3(2H)-one 1,1-dioxide] and 52, 2-(2-(3-(3,5-difluorobenzylamino)piperidin-1-yl)ethyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione) have been identified. Compound 26 exhibited the highest inhibitory potency against EeAChE (IC50 = 0.83 muM) and inhibitory activity against hBACE1 (33.61% at 50 muM). Compound 52 is a selective AChE inhibitor (IC50 AChE = 6.47 muM) with BACE1 inhibitory activity (26.3% at 50 muM) and it displays the most significant Abeta anti-aggregating properties among all the obtained compounds (39% at 10 muM). Kinetic and molecular modeling studies indicate that 26 may act as non-competitive AChE inhibitor able to interact with both catalytic and peripheral active site of the enzyme.",

    "title": "Limitations of the hCMEC/D3 cell line as a model for Abeta clearance by the human blood-brain barrier.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are characterized by accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) at the cerebrovasculature due to decreased clearance at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, the exact mechanism of Abeta clearance across this barrier has not been fully elucidated. The hCMEC/D3 cell line has been characterized as a valid model for the BBB. In this study we evaluated the use of this model to study Abeta clearance across the BBB, with an emphasis on brain-to-blood directional permeability. Barrier integrity of hCMEC/D3 monolayers was confirmed for large molecules in both the apical to basolateral and the reverse direction. However, permeability for smaller molecules was substantially higher, especially in basolateral to apical direction, and barrier formation for Abeta was completely absent in this direction. In addition, hCMEC/D3 cells failed to develop a high TEER, possibly caused by incomplete formation of tight junctions. We conclude that the hCMEC/D3 model has several limitations to study the cerebral clearance of Abeta. Therefore, the model needs further characterization before this cell system can be generally applied as a model to study cerebral Abeta clearance.   2016 The Authors Journal of Neuroscience Research Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "title": "Relationship between mutant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 maturation and inclusion formation in cell models.",
    "abstract": "A common property of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), harboring mutations associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is a high propensity to misfold and form abnormal aggregates. The aggregation of mutant SOD1 has been demonstrated in vitro, with purified proteins, in mouse models, in human tissues, and in cultured cell models. In vitro translation studies have determined that SOD1 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mutations is slower to mature, and thus perhaps vulnerable to off-pathway folding that could generate aggregates. The aggregation of mutant SOD1 in living cells can be monitored by tagging the protein with fluorescent fluorophores. In this study, we have taken advantage of the Dendra2 fluorophore technology in which excitation can be used to switch the output color from green to red, thereby clearly creating a time stamp that distinguishes pre-existing and newly made proteins. In cells that transiently over-express the Ala 4 to Val variant of SOD1-Dendra2, we observed that newly made mutant SOD1 was rapidly captured by pathologic intracellular inclusions. In cell models of mutant SOD1 aggregation over-expressing untagged A4V-SOD1, we observed that immature forms of the protein, lacking a Cu co-factor and a normal intramolecular disulfide, persist for extended periods. Our findings fit with a model in which immature forms of mutant A4V-SOD1, including newly made protein, are prone to misfolding and aggregation.",

Because of their lack of a stable three-dimensional structure, molecular dynamics simulations are often used to obtain atomistic details that cannot be observed experimentally. The applicability of molecular dynamics simulations depends on the accuracy of the force field chosen to represent the underlying free energy surface of the system. Here, we use replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations to test five modern force fields, OPLS, AMBER99SB, AMBER99SB*ILDN, AMBER99SBILDN-NMR and CHARMM22*, in their ability to model Abeta42 , an intrinsically disordered peptide associated with Alzheimer's disease, and compare our results to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experimental data.

AMNART IQ served as a proxy of CR and cognitive performance was assessed using the MMSE. In separate linear regression models predicting MMSE, we examined the interactions of CR x global Abeta and CR x IFT tau across all participants and within the CN group alone. In the whole sample, the interaction between CR and IFT tau was significant (p < 0.003), such that higher CR participants with elevated IFT tau had better MMSE scores compared with low CR participants with similar levels of IFT tau. The interaction between CR and Abeta status did not reach significance (p = 0.093). In CN only, no cross-sectional interactions among CR, Abeta, and IFT tau were observed on MMSE. These findings imply that CR may be protective against early AD processes and enable some individuals to remain cognitively stable despite elevated tau and Abeta burden.",

We previously reported an age-related increase of tau protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of amyloid beta (Abeta) precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. METHODS: APP transgenic mice were treated with a potent BACE1 inhibitor. CSF tau and CSF Abeta levels were assessed. A novel high-sensitivity tau sandwich immunoassay was developed. RESULTS: We demonstrate that long-term BACE1 inhibition prevents CSF tau increase both in early-depositing APP transgenic mice and APP transgenic mice with moderate Abeta pathology. DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrate that BACE1 inhibition not only reduces Abeta generation but also downstream AD pathophysiology. The tight correlation between Abeta aggregation in brain and CSF tau levels renders CSF tau a valuable marker to predict the effectiveness of BACE1 inhibitors in current clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Kai Xin San (KXS), a traditional formula of Chinese medicine, has been used to treat dementia. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study aimed to investigate its ameliorating effects on Abeta1-40-induced cognitive impairment in rats using a series of novel reward-directed instrumental learning tasks, and to determine its possible mechanism of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were pretreated with KXS aqueous extract (0.72 and 1.44g/kg, p.o.) for 10 days, and were trained to gain reward reinforcement by lever pressing at the meantime. Thereafter, rats received a bilateral microinjection of Abeta1-40 in CA1 regions of the hippocampus. Cognitive performance was evaluated with the goal directed (higher response ratio) and habit (visual signal discrimination and extinction) learning tasks, as well as on the levels of memory-related biochemical parameters and molecules. RESULTS: Our findings first demonstrated that KXS can improve Abeta1-40-induced amnesia in RDIL via enhancing the comprehension of action-outcome association and the utilization of cue information to guide behavior. Then, its ameliorating effects should be attributed to the modulation of memory-related molecules in the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, KXS has the potential to prevent and/or delay the deterioration of cognitive impairment in AD.",

Therefore, significant efforts in AD drug discovery research aim to prevent the formation of Abeta oligomers or block their neurotoxicity. The eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF2K) plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity, and couples neurotransmission to local dendritic mRNA translation. Recent evidence indicates that Abeta oligomers activate neuronal eEF2K, suggesting a potential link to Abeta induced synaptic dysfunction. However, a detailed understanding of the role of eEF2K in AD pathogenesis, and therapeutic potential of eEF2K inhibition in AD, remain to be determined. Here, we show that eEF2K activity is increased in postmortem AD patient cortex and hippocampus, and in the hippocampus of aged transgenic AD mice. Furthermore, eEF2K inhibition using pharmacological or genetic approaches prevented the toxic effects of Abeta42 oligomers on neuronal viability and dendrite formation in vitro. We also report that eEF2K inhibition promotes the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF2) antioxidant response in neuronal cells, which was crucial for the beneficial effects of eEF2K inhibition in neurons exposed to Abeta42 oligomers. Accordingly, NRF2 knockdown or overexpression of the NRF2 inhibitor, Kelch-Like ECH-Associated Protein-1 (Keap1), significantly attenuated the neuroprotection associated with eEF2K inhibition. Finally, genetic deletion of the eEF2K ortholog efk-1 reduced oxidative stress, and improved chemotaxis and serotonin sensitivity in C. elegans expressing human Abeta42 in neurons. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential utility of eEF2K inhibition to reduce Abeta-mediated oxidative stress in AD.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) exhibit Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology and dementia early in life. Blood biomarkers of AD neuropathology would be valuable, as non-AD intellectual disabilities of DS and AD dementia overlap clinically. We hypothesized that elevations of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides and phosphorylated-tau in neuronal exosomes may document preclinical AD. METHODS: AD neuropathogenic proteins Abeta1-42, P-T181-tau, and P-S396-tau were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in extracts of neuronal exosomes purified from blood of individuals with DS and age-matched controls. RESULTS: Neuronal exosome levels of Abeta1-42, P-T181-tau, and P-S396-tau were significantly elevated in individuals with DS compared with age-matched controls at all ages beginning in childhood. No significant gender differences were observed. DISCUSSION: These early increases in Abeta1-42, P-T181-tau, and P-S396-tau in individuals with DS may provide a basis for early intervention as targeted treatments become available.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms involved in Alzheimer's disease are not completely understood and how astrocytes and their gliotransmission contribute to this neurodegenerative disease remains to be fully elucidated. Previous studies have shown that amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) induces neuronal death by a mechanism that involves the excitotoxic release of ATP and glutamate associated to astroglial hemichannel opening. We have demonstrated that synthetic and endogenous cannabinoids (CBs) reduce the opening of astrocyte Cx43 hemichannels evoked by activated microglia or inflammatory mediators. Nevertheless, whether CBs could prevent the astroglial hemichannel-dependent death of neurons evoked by Abeta is unknown. Astrocytes as well as acute hippocampal slices were treated with the active fragment of Abeta alone or in combination with the following CBs: WIN, 2-AG, or methanandamide (Meth). Hemichannel activity was monitored by single channel recordings and by time-lapse ethidium uptake while neuronal death was assessed by Fluoro-Jade C staining. We report that CBs fully prevented the hemichannel activity and inflammatory profile evoked by Abeta in astrocytes. Moreover, CBs fully abolished the Abeta-induced release of excitotoxic glutamate and ATP associated to astrocyte Cx43 hemichannel activity, as well as neuronal damage in hippocampal slices exposed to Abeta. Consequently, this work opens novel avenues for alternative treatments that target astrocytes to maintain neuronal function and survival during AD. GLIA 2016 GLIA 2017;65:122-137.",

The presence of senile plaques and the loss of cholinergic neurons in the brain are two neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Maternal separation (MS) is an animal paradigm designed to make early life stress. Studies on wild type rodents showed that MS could induce AD-like cognitive deficit and pathological changes. However, the effects of MS on AD susceptible population or AD animal models are still unclear. In the present study, male APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice were separated from dam and pups 3h per day from postnatal day 2 to day 21. After weaning, all animals were housed under normal conditions (4 mice per cage). At 9-month age, MWM tests were performed to evaluate the learning and memory abilities. Then the pathological changes in the brain were measured by histology staining. The results showed MS mice had more severe deficit of learning and memory. Compared to the control, there were more senile plaques in cortex and hippocampus, fewer cholinergic neurons in nucleus basalis of Meynert in MS mice. These results indicate that MS exacerbates Alzheimer's disease-like behavioral and pathological changes in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.",

Although it has been frequently proposed that the deposition of Abeta in the walls of cortical vessels directly causes microhemorrhages, this has not been studied in great detail, mainly because the ruptured vessels are often missed on routine histopathologic examination. Here, we examined histopathological data from studies targeting microhemorrhages with high-resolution ex vivo 7 T MRI in nine cases with moderate-to-severe CAA, and assessed the presence of Abeta in the walls of involved vessels. We also assessed the density of Abeta positive cortical vessels in areas surrounding microhemorrhages compared to control areas. In seven out of 19 microhemorrhages, the presumed involved vessel could be identified on the histopathological section. Only one of these vessels was positive for Abeta at the site of rupture. Moreover, the density of Abeta positive cortical vessels was lower (1.0 per mm2) within a range of 315 microm surrounding the microhemorrhage, compared to control areas (2.0 per mm2; p < 0.05). These findings question the widely held assumption that the deposition of Abeta in the walls of cortical vessels directly causes microhemorrhages.",

An active vaccine against fibrillar Abeta 1-42 (VAC) in aged beagles resulted in maintenance but not improvement of cognition along with reduced brain Abeta. Behavioral enrichment (ENR) led to cognitive benefits but no reduction in Abeta. We hypothesized cognitive outcomes could be improved by combining VAC with ENR in aged dogs. Aged dogs (11-12 years) were placed into 4 groups: (1) control/control (C/C); (2) control/VAC (C/V); (3) ENR/control (E/C); and (4) ENR/VAC (E/V) and treated for 20 months. VAC decreased brain Abeta, pyroglutamate Abeta, increased cerebrospinal fluid Abeta 42 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor RNA levels but also increased microhemorrhages. ENR reduced brain Abeta and prevented microhemorrhages. The combination treatment resulted in a significant maintenance of learning over time, reduced Abeta, and increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA despite increased microhemorrhages; however, there were no benefits to memory. These results suggest that the combination of immunotherapy with behavioral enrichment leads to cognitive maintenance associated with reduced neuropathology that may benefit people with Alzheimer's disease.",

Hence, drugs enhancing insulin signaling may have therapeutic potential for AD. Lixisenatide, a novel long-lasting glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogue, facilitates insulin signaling and has neuroprotective properties. We previously reported the protective effects of lixisenatide on memory formation and synaptic plasticity. Here, we describe additional key neuroprotective properties of lixisenatide and its possible molecular and cellular mechanisms against AD-related impairments in rats. The results show that lixisenatide effectively alleviated amyloid beta protein (Abeta) 25-35-induced working memory impairment, reversed Abeta25-35-triggered cytotoxicity on hippocampal cell cultures, and prevented against Abeta25-35-induced suppression of the Akt-MEK1/2 signaling pathway. Lixisenatide also reduced the Abeta25-35 acute application induced intracellular calcium overload, which was abolished by U0126, a specific MEK1/2 inhibitor. These results further confirmed the neuroprotective and cytoprotective action of lixisenatide against Abeta-induced impairments, suggesting that the protective effects of lixisenatide may involve the activation of the Akt-MEK1/2 signaling pathway and the regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Recent data suggest that intraneuronal accumulation of metabolites of the amyloid-beta-precursor protein (APP) is neurotoxic. We observed that transgenic mice overexpressing in neurons a human APP gene harboring the APPE693Q (Dutch) mutation have intraneuronal lysosomal accumulation of APP carboxylterminal fragments (APP-CTFs) and oligomeric amyloid beta (oAbeta) but no histological evidence of amyloid deposition. Morphometric quantification using the lysosomal marker protein 2 (LAMP-2) immunolabeling showed higher neuronal lysosomal counts in brain of 12-months-old APPE693Q as compared with age-matched non-transgenic littermates, and western blots showed increased lysosomal proteins including LAMP-2, cathepsin D and LC3. At 24 months of age, these mice also exhibited an accumulation of alpha-synuclein in the brain, along with increased conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, an autophagosomal/autolysosomal marker. In addition to lysosomal changes at 12 months of age, these mice developed cholinergic neuronal loss in the basal forebrain, GABAergic neuronal loss in the cortex, hippocampus and basal forebrain and gliosis and microgliosis in the hippocampus. These findings suggest a role for the intraneuronal accumulation of oAbeta and APP-CTFs and resultant lysosomal pathology at early stages of Alzheimer's disease-related pathology.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) plays a critical role in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our previous studies indicated that the sequence 31-35 in Abeta molecule is an effective active center responsible for Abeta neurotoxicity in vivo and in vitro. In the present study, we prepared a novel antibody specifically targeting the sequence 31-35 of amyloid beta protein, and investigated the neuroprotection of the anti-Abeta31-35 antibody against Abeta1-42 -induced impairments in neuronal viability, spatial memory, and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in rats. The results showed that the anti-Abeta31-35 antibody almost equally bound to both Abeta31-35 and Abeta1-42 , and pretreatment with the antibody dose-dependently prevented Abeta1-42 -induced cytotoxicity on cultured primary cortical neurons. In behavioral study, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of anti-Abeta31-35 antibody efficiently attenuated Abeta1-42 -induced impairments in spatial learning and memory of rats. In vivo electrophysiological experiments further indicated that Abeta1-42 -induced suppression of hippocampal synaptic plasticity was effectively reversed by the antibody. These results demonstrated that the sequence 31-35 of Abeta may be a new therapeutic target, and the anti-Abeta31-35 antibody could be a novel immunotheraputic approach for the treatment of AD.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Impairment of amyloid-beta (Abeta) clearance leads to Abeta accumulation in the brain during the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Strategies that can restore or improve the clearance function hold great promise in delaying or preventing the onset of AD. Here, we show that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), by use of fat-1 transgenic mice and oral administration of fish oil, significantly promote interstitial Abeta clearance from the brain and resist Abeta injury. Such beneficial effects were abolished in Aqp4-knockout mice, suggesting that the AQP4-dependent glymphatic system is actively involved in the promoting the effects of n-3 PUFAs on the clearance of extracellular Abeta. Imaging on clarified brain tissues clearly displayed that n-3 PUFAs markedly inhibit the activation of astrocytes and protect the AQP4 polarization in the affected brain region after Abeta injection. The results of the present study prove a novel mechanism by which n-3 PUFAs exert protective roles in reducing Abeta accumulation via mediating the glymphatic system function.-Ren, H., Luo, C., Feng, Y., Yao, X., Shi, Z., Liang, F., Kang, J.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether concomitant Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, reflected by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, has an impact on dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in terms of clinical presentation, cognitive decline, nursing home admittance and survival. PARTICIPANTS: We selected 111 patients with probable DLB and CSF available from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. On the basis of the AD biomarker profile (CSF tau/amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta42) ratio >0.52), we divided patients into a DLB/AD+ and DLB/AD- group. Of the 111 patients, 42 (38%) had an AD CSF biomarker profile. We investigated differences between groups in memory, attention, executive functions, language and visuospatial functions. Difference in global cognitive decline (repeated Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)) was investigated using linear mixed models. Cox proportional hazard analyses were used to investigate the effects of the AD biomarker profile on time to nursing home admittance and time to death. RESULTS: Memory performance was worse in DLB/AD+ patients compared with DLB/AD- patients (p<0.01), also after correction for age and sex. Hallucinations were more frequent in DLB/AD+ (OR=3.34, 95% CI 1.22-9.18). There was no significant difference in the rate of cognitive decline. DLB/AD+ patients had a higher mortality risk (HR=3.13, 95% CI 1.57 to 6.24) and nursing home admittance risk (HR=11.70, 95% CI 3.74 to 36.55) compared with DLB/AD- patients. CONCLUSIONS: DLB-patients with a CSF AD profile have a more severe manifestation of the disease and a higher risk of institutionalisation and mortality. In clinical practice, CSF biomarkers may aid in predicting prognosis in DLB. In addition, DLB-patients with positive AD biomarkers could benefit from future treatment targeting AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by deficits in learning and memory abilities, as well as pathological changes of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque and neurofibrillary tangle formation in the brain. Insulin has been identified as a modulator of the neuronal pathways involved in learning and memory, and is also implicated as a modulator of Abeta and tau metabolism. Disrupted insulin signaling pathways are evident in AD patients and it is understood that type 2 diabetes can increase the risk of developing AD, suggesting a possible link between metabolic disorders and neurodegeneration. SH2B1 is a key protein in the insulin signaling pathway involved in regulating the activity of the insulin receptor. To further identify the role of the insulin signaling pathway in the pathology of AD, SH2B (dSH2B homologue in flies) in neurons was partially knocked out or overexpressed in an AD Drosophila model expressing Abeta42. Partial knockout of neuronal SH2B in the Abeta42-expressing Drosophila had a detrimental effect on mobility and neurotransmission, and increased levels and intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta42, as assessed by ELISA and immunostaining. Alternatively, partial overexpression of neuronal SH2B in the Abeta42-expressing Drosophila improved lifespan, mobility, and neurotransmission, as well as decreased levels and intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta42. Thus, SH2B1 may be an upstream modulator of Abeta metabolism, acting to inhibit Abeta accumulation, and has a role in the pathogenesis of AD. SH2B1 may therefore have potential as a therapeutic target for this common form of dementia.",

    "abstract": "The clinical heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease is not reflected in the rather diffuse cortical deposition of amyloid-beta. We assessed the relationship between clinical symptoms, in vivo tau pathology, amyloid distribution, and hypometabolism in variants of Alzheimer's disease using novel multimodal PET imaging techniques. Tau pathology was primarily observed in brain regions related to clinical symptoms and overlapped with areas of hypometabolism. In contrast, amyloid-beta deposition was diffusely distributed over the entire cortex. Tau PET imaging may thus serve as a valuable biomarker for the localization of neuronal injury in vivo and may help to validate atypical subtypes of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are a type of glia from the mammalian olfactory system, with neuroprotective and regenerative properties. beta-Amyloid peptides are a major component of the senile plaques characteristic of the Alzheimer brain. The amyloid beta (Abeta) precursor protein is cleaved to amyloid peptides, and Abeta25-35 is regarded to be the functional domain of Abeta, responsible for its neurotoxic properties. It has been reported that Abeta25-35 triggers reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative damage, altering the structure and function of mitochondria, leading to the activation of the mitochondrial intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Our goal is to investigate the effects of OECs on the toxicity of aggregated Abeta25-35, in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. For such purpose, SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with Abeta25-35 and OEC-conditioned medium (OECCM). OECCM promoted the cell viability and reduced the apoptosis, and decreased the intracellular ROS and the lipid peroxidation. In the presence of OECCM, mRNA and protein levels of antioxidant enzymes (SOD1 and SOD2) were upregulated. Concomitantly, OECCM decreased mRNA and the protein expression levels of cytochrome c, caspase-9, caspase-3, and Bax in SH-SY5Y cells, and increased mRNA and the protein expression level of Bcl-2. However, OECCM did not alter intracellular Ca2+ concentration in SH-SY5Y cells. Taken together, our data suggest that OECCM ameliorates Abeta25-35-induced oxidative damage in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells by inhibiting the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway. These data provide new insights into the functional actions of OECCM on oxidative stress-induced cell damage.",

    "abstract": "In response to changes of the central nervous system environment, microglia are capable of acquiring diverse phenotypes for cytotoxic or immune regulation and resolution of injury. Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology also induces several microglial activations, resulting in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species or clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) through phagocytosis. We previously demonstrated that microglial activation and increase in oxidative stress started from the middle age in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, and hypothesized that M1 activation occurs in middle-aged AD mice by Abeta stimulation. In the present study, we analyzed in vivo expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines (M1 microglial markers), M2 microglial markers, and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family, and examined the microglial phenotypic profile in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Then we compared the in vitro gene expression patterns of Abeta- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated primary-cultured microglia. Microglia in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice exhibited an M1-like phenotype, expressing tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) but not interleukin 6 (IL6). Abeta-stimulated primary-cultured microglia also expressed TNFalpha but not IL6, whereas LPS-stimulated primary-cultured microglia expressed both pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, both microglia in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice and Abeta-stimulated primary-cultured microglia expressed SOCS3. Reduction of SOCS3 expression in Abeta-challenged primary-cultured microglia resulted in upregulation of IL6 expression. Our findings indicate that SOCS3 suppresses complete polarization to M1 phenotype through blocking IL6 production, and Abeta-challenged primary-cultured microglia replicate the in vivo gene expression pattern of microglia in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Abeta may induce the M1-like phenotype through blocking of IL6 by SOCS3.",

Here we investigated the mechanism and antioxidative function of KHG26693 in the hippocampus of Abeta-treated mice. KHG26693 significantly attenuated Abeta-induced TNF-alpha and IL-1beta enhancements. KHG26693 decreased Abeta-mediated malondialdehyde formation, protein oxidation, and reactive oxygen species by decreasing the iNOS level. KHG26693 suppressed Abeta-induced oxidative stress through a mechanism involving glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and GSH attenuation. Abeta-induced MMP-2, cPLA2, and pcPLA2 expressions were almost completely attenuated by KHG26693 treatment, suggesting that Abeta-induced oxidative stress reduction by KHG26693 is, at least partly, caused by the downregulation of MMP-2 and cPLA2 activation. Compared with Abeta treatment, KHG26693 treatment upregulated Nrf2 and HO-1 expressions, suggesting that KHG26693 protects the brain from Abeta-induced oxidative damage, likely by maintaining redox balance through Nrf2/HO-1 pathway regulation.

    "abstract": "Prion diseases are associated with conversion of cellular prion protein (PrPC) into an abnormally folded and infectious scrapie isoform (PrPSc). We previously showed that peptides derived from the unprocessed N-termini of mouse and bovine prion proteins, mPrP1-28 and bPrP1-30, function as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), and destabilize model membrane systems, which could explain the infectivity and toxicity of prion diseases. However, subsequent studies revealed that treatment with mPrP1-28 or bPrP1-30 significantly reduce PrPSc levels in prion-infected cells. To explain these seemingly contradictory results, we correlated the aggregation, membrane perturbation and cytotoxicity of the peptides with their cellular uptake and intracellular localization. Although the peptides have a similar primary sequence, mPrP1-28 is amyloidogenic, whereas bPrP1-30 forms smaller oligomeric or non-fibrillar aggregates. Surprisingly, bPrP1-30 induces much higher cytotoxicity than mPrP1-28, indicating that amyloid formation and toxicity are independent. The toxicity is correlated with prolonged residence at the plasma membrane and membrane perturbation. Both ordered aggregation and toxicity of the peptides are inhibited by low pH. Under non-toxic conditions, the peptides are internalized by lipid-raft dependent macropinocytosis and localize to acidic lysosomal compartments. Our results shed light on the antiprion mechanism of the prion protein-derived CPPs and identify a potential site for PrPSc formation.",

    "abstract": "Despite existing knowledge about the role of the A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) as the alpha-secretase involved in the non-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch signalling we have only limited information about its regulation. In this study, we have identified ADAM10 interactors using a split ubiquitin yeast two hybrid approach. Tetraspanin 3 (Tspan3), which is highly expressed in the murine brain and elevated in brains of Alzheimer s disease (AD) patients, was identified and confirmed to bind ADAM10 by co-immunoprecipitation experiments in mammalian cells in complex with APP and the gamma-secretase protease presenilin. Tspan3 expression increased the cell surface levels of its interacting partners and was mainly localized in early and late endosomes. In contrast to the previously described ADAM10-binding tetraspanins, Tspan3 did not affect the endoplasmic reticulum to plasma membrane transport of ADAM10. Heterologous Tspan3 expression significantly increased the appearance of carboxy-terminal cleavage products of ADAM10 and APP, whereas N-cadherin ectodomain shedding appeared unaffected. Inhibiting the endocytosis of Tspan3 by mutating a critical cytoplasmic tyrosine-based internalization motif led to increased surface expression of APP and ADAM10. After its downregulation in neuroblastoma cells and in brains of Tspan3-deficient mice, ADAM10 and APP levels appeared unaltered possibly due to a compensatory increase in the expression of Tspans 5 and 7, respectively. In conclusion, our data suggest that Tspan3 acts in concert with other tetraspanins as a stabilizing factor of active ADAM10, APP and the gamma-secretase complex at the plasma membrane and within the endocytic pathway.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta-peptide (Abeta) is considered to be the toxic species in AD and causes cell death in the affected areas of patient's brain. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) has been reported to attenuate Abeta toxicity in neuronal cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective function of IGF-1 remain largely unknown. In the present study, we for the first time demonstrated that IGF-1 protects against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity via inhibition of PUMA expression and Bax activation. We found that IGF-1 could activate Akt, which in turn inhibited Abeta-induced FOXO3a nuclear translocation and thus decreased the binding ability of FOXO3a to PUMA promoter, leading to decreased PUMA expression. In addition, IGF-1 inhibited the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria induced by Abeta. Notably, addition of wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI3K, significantly abolished the neuroprotective effect of IGF-1, suggesting that IGF-1 exerts its anti-apoptotic effect depend on PI3K activity. Our findings may provide new insights into molecular mechanisms mediated by IGF-1 in cell survival against Abeta-induced apoptosis.",

However, the connection between these factors is unclear. We aimed to provide an extensive characterization of the gene expression profiles of the amyloidosis APP23 model for AD and control mice and to evaluate the effect of aging on these profiles. We also correlated our findings to changes in soluble Abeta-levels and other pathological and symptomatic features of the model. We observed a clear biphasic expression profile. The first phase displayed a maturation profile, which resembled features found in young carriers of familial AD mutations. The second phase reflected aging processes and showed similarities to the progression of human AD pathology. During this phase, the model displayed a clear upregulation of microglial activation and lysosomal pathways and downregulation of neuron differentiation and axon guidance pathways. Interestingly, the changes in expression were all correlated to aging in general, but appeared more extensive/accelerated in APP23 mice.",

    "title": "Association of Amyloid Pathology With Myelin Alteration in Preclinical Alzheimer Disease.",
    "abstract": "Importance: The accumulation of aggregated beta-amyloid and tau proteins into plaques and tangles is a central feature of Alzheimer disease (AD). While plaque and tangle accumulation likely contributes to neuron and synapse loss, disease-related changes to oligodendrocytes and myelin are also suspected of playing a role in development of AD dementia. Still, to our knowledge, little is known about AD-related myelin changes, and even when present, they are often regarded as secondary to concomitant arteriosclerosis or related to aging. Objective: To assess associations between hallmark AD pathology and novel quantitative neuroimaging markers while being sensitive to white matter myelin content. Design, Setting, and Participants: Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at an academic research neuroimaging center on a cohort of 71 cognitively asymptomatic adults enriched for AD risk. Lumbar punctures were performed and assayed for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD pathology, including beta-amyloid 42, total tau protein, phosphorylated tau 181, and soluble amyloid precursor protein. We measured whole-brain longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates as well as the myelin water fraction from each of these individuals. Main Outcomes and Measures: Automated brain mapping algorithms and statistical models were used to evaluate the relationships between age, CSF biomarkers of AD pathology, and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging relaxometry measures, including the longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates and the myelin water fraction. Results: The mean (SD) age for the 19 male participants and 52 female participants in the study was 61.6 (6.4) years. Widespread age-related changes to myelin were observed across the brain, particularly in late myelinating brain regions such as frontal white matter and the genu of the corpus callosum. Quantitative relaxometry measures were negatively associated with levels of CSF biomarkers across brain white matter and in areas preferentially affected in AD. Furthermore, significant age-by-biomarker interactions were observed between myelin water fraction and phosphorylated tau 181/beta-amyloid 42, suggesting that phosphorylated tau 181/beta-amyloid 42 levels modulate age-related changes in myelin water fraction. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest amyloid pathologies significantly influence white matter and that these abnormalities may signify an early feature of the disease process. We expect that clarifying the nature of myelin damage in preclinical AD may be informative on the disease's course and lead to new markers of efficacy for prevention and treatment trials.",

Its deposition on plasma and intracellular membranes and aggregation into amyloid plaques can disturb the composition and physiological function of neurons. Whether a physical property of cells, such as stiffness, is altered by endogenously overexpressed Abeta has not yet been investigated. In this study, we used human neuroblastoma cells stably overexpressing amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its Swedish mutant form (APPswe) to measure the changes in cell stiffness. Our results showed that the stiffness of cells overexpressing APP or APPswe was higher than that of control SH-SY5Y cells. Either reducing levels of Abeta with the gamma secretase inhibitor DAPT or blocking the membrane calcium channel formed by Abeta with tromethamine decreased cell stiffness to a level close to the control SH-SY5Y cells. Our results suggested that Abeta, not APP, contributed to increased cell stiffness and that closure of calcium channels formed by Abeta can alleviate the effects of Abeta on membrane stiffness.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder leading to cognitive decline, neuropsychiatric symptoms, disability, caregiver burden, and premature death. It represents the most prevalent cause of dementia, and its incidence rates exponentially increase with increasing age. The number of Americans living with AD is rapidly increasing. An estimated 5.4 million Americans of all ages have AD in 2016. One in nine people aged 65 and older has AD, and by midcentury, someone in the United States will develop the disease every 33 sec. It is now accepted that neuroinflammation is a common feature of neurological disease. Inflammasomes, which are a multiprotein complex part of the innate immune system, induce inflammation in response to various stimuli, such as pathogens and stress. Inflammasomes activate proinflammatory caspases, such as caspase-1, leading to the activation of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-18, and IL-33, which promote neuroinflammation and brain pathologies. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is the best characterized in neurodegenerative diseases, in particular AD. Recent research suggests that NLRP3 could possibly be used in targeted therapies to alleviate neuroinflammation. Modulation of endogenous cellular defense mechanisms may be an innovative approach to therapeutic intervention in AD and other disorders associated with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Herein, we introduce the hormetic dose-response concept and present possible mechanisms and applications to neuroprotection. We summarize the mechanisms involved in activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its role in neuroinflammation. We also address and propose the potential therapeutic utility of the nutritional antioxidants sulforaphane and hydroxytyrosol against particular signs and symptoms of AD.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: Epidemiological evidence implicates polyphenols as potential natural therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD). To investigate this prospect, five anthoxanthin polyphenols were characterized for their ability to reduce amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomer-induced neuronal responses by two mechanisms of action, modulation of oligomerization and antioxidant activity, as well as the synergy between these two mechanisms. METHODS: Anthoxanthin oligomerization modulation and antioxidant capabilities were evaluated and correlated with anthoxanthin attenuation of oligomer-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase activation using human neuroblastoma cell treatments designed to isolate these mechanisms of action and to achieve dual-action. RESULTS: While modulation of oligomerization resulted in only minor reductions to neuronal responses, anthoxanthin antioxidant action significantly attenuated oligomer-induced intracellular ROS and caspase activation. Kaempferol uniquely exhibited synergism when the two mechanisms functioned in concert, leading to a pronounced reduction in both ROS and caspase activation. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings identify the dominant mechanism by which these anthoxanthins attenuate Abeta oligomer-induced neuronal responses, elucidate their prospective synergy, and demonstrate the potential of anthoxanthin polyphenols as natural AD therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Herbal medicines have been recently employed in research and clinical studies for the potential treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other types of dementia. The present study investigates the effect of trans-crocetin, an active constituent of Crocus sativus L., to restore in vitro the reduced ability of AD patients' monocytes to degrade amyloid-beta(1-42) (Abeta42). CD14+ monocytes from 22 sporadic AD patients with moderate cognitive impairment were isolated; then, the role of trans-crocetin, purified from saffron extracts, was evaluated in terms of Abeta42 degradation rate through flow cytometry, as well as expression of cathepsin B by Western blotting. We observed that low micromolar doses of trans-crocetin enhanced Abeta42 degradation in AD monocytes through the upregulation of the lysosomal protease cathepsin B. CA074Me, a potent and selective cathepsin B inhibitor, counteracted such trans-crocetin-induced effect. These data suggest that the carotenoid trans-crocetin improves in vitro the clearance of Abeta42 through the involvement of cathepsin B, and this could be of value in developing a new anti-amyloid strategy in AD.",

We estimated rates of clinical progression and tested whether associations between clinical progression and Alzheimer's disease neuropathology (ADNP) were modified by co-occurring Lewy body disease (LBD) or vascular brain injury (VBI). METHODS: Linear mixed effects models evaluated longitudinal trends in the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes on 2046 autopsied participants seen at a U.S. Alzheimer's Disease Center. RESULTS: Annual clinical progression was slightly faster for ADNP + LBD compared with ADNP only (P = .06) and slightly slower for ADNP + VBI (P = .003). Differences in progression were less than expected if each neuropathology independently contributed to progression; ADNP interacted with LBD (P = .002) and VBI (P = .003). In secondary models, the effect of additional pathologies on clinical progression was greater in those with intermediate compared with high levels of ADNP. DISCUSSION: The impact of co-occurring pathologies on progression may depend on severity of ADNP.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an imbalance between production and clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) species. Abeta peptides can transform structurally from monomers into beta-stranded fibrils via multiple oligomeric states. Among the various Abeta species, structured oligomers are proposed to be more toxic than fibrils; however, the identification of Abeta oligomers has been challenging due to their heterogeneous and metastable nature. Multiple techniques have recently helped us gain a better understanding of oligomers' assembly details and structural properties. Moreover, some progress on elucidating the mechanisms of oligomer-triggered toxicity has been made. Based on the collection of current findings, there is growing consensus that control of toxic Abeta oligomers could be a valid approach to regulate Abeta-associated toxicity, which could advance development of new diagnostics and therapeutics for amyloid-related diseases. In this review, we summarize the recent understanding of Abeta oligomers' assembly, structural properties, and toxicity, along with inhibitors against Abeta aggregation, including oligomerization.",

    "abstract": "Transcellular propagation of tau aggregates may underlie the progression of pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Braak staging (B1, B2, B3) is based on phospho-tau accumulation within connected brain regions: entorhinal cortex (B1); hippocampus/limbic system (B2); and frontal and parietal lobes (B3). We previously developed a specific and sensitive assay that uses flow cytometry to quantify tissue seeding activity based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in cells that stably express tau reporter proteins. In a tauopathy mouse model, we have detected seeding activity far in advance of histopathological changes. It remains unknown whether individuals with AD also develop seeding activity prior to accumulation of phospho-tau. We measured tau seeding activity across four brain regions (hippocampus, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and cerebellum) in 104 fresh-frozen human AD brain samples from all Braak stages. We observed widespread seeding activity, notably in regions predicted to be free of phospho-tau deposition, and in detergent-insoluble fractions that lacked tau detectable by ELISA. Seeding activity correlated positively with Braak stage and negatively with MMSE. Our results are consistent with early transcellular propagation of tau seeds that triggers subsequent development of neuropathology. The FRET-based seeding assay may also complement standard neuropathological classification of tauopathies.",

Abeta sequence and lipid composition are essential variables to consider when elucidating the impact of biological membranes on Abeta structure and the effect of Abeta on membrane integrity. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations testing two Abeta sequences, human and rat Abeta (HAbeta and RAbeta, respectively), and five lipid types were performed to assess the effect of these variables on membrane perturbation and potential link to AD phenotype differences based on differences in sequence. All metrics agree insomuch that monomeric HAbeta and RAbeta contribute to membrane perturbation by causing a more rigid, gel-like lipid phase. Differences between HAbeta and RAbeta binding on degree of membrane perturbation were based on lipid headgroup properties. Cholesterol was found to moderate the amount of perturbation caused by HAbeta and RAbeta in a model raft membrane. The difference in position of an arginine residue between HAbeta and RAbeta influenced peptide-membrane interactions and was determined to be the mediating factor in observed differences in lipid affinity and degree of membrane disruption. Overall, this work increases our understanding of the influence of sequence and lipid type on Abeta-membrane interactions and their relationship to AD.",

    "abstract": "Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) shows protective effect against Abeta-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly characterized. The present study was conducted to explore the mechanisms involved in the beneficial effect of IGF-1 against Abeta-induced apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. We found that pretreatment with IGF-1 attenuated Abeta25-35-induced loss of cell viability and apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, IGF-1 inhibited the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased the antioxidant activity in Abeta25-35-treated cells. Further, IGF-1 significantly promoted the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, and upregulated the expression of its downstream gene heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Moreover, LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitor, was found to completely abolish the protective effect of IGF-1 on Abeta25-35-induced apoptosis and ROS generation. Together, our findings suggest that IGF-1 protects SH-SY5Y cells against Abeta25-35-induced cell injury by scavenging ROS via the PI3K/Akt-Nrf2 signaling pathway.",

These peptides play a role in Alzheimer's and other dementia-related diseases. The cargo binding domain of the kinesin-1 light chain motor protein (KLC1) may be responsible for transporting APP either directly or via interaction with C-jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein 1 (JIP1). However, to date there has been no direct experimental or computational assessment of such binding at the atomistic level. We used molecular dynamics and free energy estimations to gauge the affinity for the binary complexes of KLC1, APP, and JIP1. We find that all binary complexes (KLC1:APP, KLC1:JIP1, and APP:JIP1) contain conformations with favorable binding free energies. For KLC1:APP the inclusion of approximate entropies reduces the favorability. This is likely due to the flexibility of the 42-residue APP protein. In all cases we analyze atomistic/residue driving forces for favorable interactions. Proteins 2017; 85:221-234.   2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "title": "A Comparison of the Prevalence of Dementia in the United States in 2000 and 2012.",
    "abstract": "Importance: The aging of the US population is expected to lead to a large increase in the number of adults with dementia, but some recent studies in the United States and other high-income countries suggest that the age-specific risk of dementia may have declined over the past 25 years. Clarifying current and future population trends in dementia prevalence and risk has important implications for patients, families, and government programs. Objective: To compare the prevalence of dementia in the United States in 2000 and 2012. Design, Setting, and Participants: We used data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative, population-based longitudinal survey of individuals in the United States 65 years or older from the 2000 (n = 10 546) and 2012 (n = 10 511) waves of the HRS. Main Outcomes and Measures: Dementia was identified in each year using HRS cognitive measures and validated methods for classifying self-respondents, as well as those represented by a proxy. Logistic regression was used to identify socioeconomic and health variables associated with change in dementia prevalence between 2000 and 2012. Results: The study cohorts had an average age of 75.0 years (95% CI, 74.8-75.2 years) in 2000 and 74.8 years (95% CI, 74.5-75.1 years) in 2012 (P = .24); 58.4% (95% CI, 57.3%-59.4%) of the 2000 cohort was female compared with 56.3% (95% CI, 55.5%-57.0%) of the 2012 cohort (P < .001). Dementia prevalence among those 65 years or older decreased from 11.6% (95% CI, 10.7%-12.7%) in 2000 to 8.8% (95% CI, 8.2%-9.4%) (8.6% with age- and sex-standardization) in 2012 (P < .001). More years of education was associated with a lower risk for dementia, and average years of education increased significantly (from 11.8 years [95% CI, 11.6-11.9 years] to 12.7 years [95% CI, 12.6-12.9 years]; P < .001) between 2000 and 2012. The decline in dementia prevalence occurred even though there was a significant age- and sex-adjusted increase between years in the cardiovascular risk profile (eg, prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity) among older US adults. Conclusions and Relevance: The prevalence of dementia in the United States declined significantly between 2000 and 2012. An increase in educational attainment was associated with some of the decline in dementia prevalence, but the full set of social, behavioral, and medical factors contributing to the decline is still uncertain. Continued monitoring of trends in dementia incidence and prevalence will be important for better gauging the full future societal impact of dementia as the number of older adults increases in the decades ahead.",

Perivascular localization of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) facilitates the clearance of interstitial solutes, including amyloid-beta, through the brainwide network of perivascular pathways termed the glymphatic system, which may be compromised in the aging brain. Objectives: To determine whether alterations in AQP4 expression or loss of perivascular AQP4 localization are features of the aging human brain and to define their association with AD pathology. Design, Setting, and Participants: Expression of AQP4 was analyzed in postmortem frontal cortex of cognitively healthy and histopathologically confirmed individuals with AD by Western blot or immunofluorescence for AQP4, amyloid-beta 1-42, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Postmortem tissue and clinical data were provided by the Oregon Health and Science University Layton Aging and Alzheimer Disease Center and Oregon Brain Bank. Postmortem tissue from 79 individuals was evaluated, including cognitively intact \"young\" individuals aged younger than 60 years (range, 33-57 years), cognitively intact \"aged\" individuals aged older than 60 years (range, 61-96 years) with no known neurological disease, and individuals older than 60 years (range, 61-105 years) of age with a clinical history of AD confirmed by histopathological evaluation. Forty-eight patient samples (10 young, 20 aged, and 18 with AD) underwent histological analysis. Sixty patient samples underwent Western blot analysis (15 young, 24 aged, and 21 with AD). Main Outcomes and Measures: Expression of AQP4 protein, AQP4 immunoreactivity, and perivascular AQP4 localization in the frontal cortex were evaluated. Results: Expression of AQP4 was associated with advancing age among all individuals (R2 = 0.17; P = .003). Perivascular AQP4 localization was significantly associated with AD status independent of age (OR, 11.7 per 10% increase in localization; z = -2.89; P = .004) and was preserved among eldest individuals older than 85 years of age who remained cognitively intact. When controlling for age, loss of perivascular AQP4 localization was associated with increased amyloid-beta burden (R2 = 0.15; P = .003) and increasing Braak stage (R2 = 0.14; P = .006). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, altered AQP4 expression was associated with aging brains. Loss of perivascular AQP4 localization may be a factor that renders the aging brain vulnerable to the misaggregation of proteins, such as amyloid-beta, in neurodegenerative conditions such as AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in the brain, which is produced by the proteolysis of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Recently, the mitochondrial transcription factor 4 (MTERF4), a member of the MTERF family, was implicated in regulating mitochondrial DNA transcription and directly in controlling mitochondrial ribosomal translation. The present study identified a novel role for MTERF4 in shifting APP processing toward the amyloidogenic pathway. The levels of MTERF4 protein were significantly increased in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. In addition, the overexpression of MTERF4 induced a significant increase in the levels of APP protein and secreted Abeta42 in HEK293-APPswe cells compared with control cells. Further, MTERF4 overexpression shifted APP processing from alpha-to beta-cleavage, as indicated by decreased C83 levels and elevated C99 levels. Finally, the MTERF4 overexpression suppressed a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) expression via a transcriptional mechanism. Taken together, these results suggest that MTERF4 promotes the amyloidogenic processing of APP by inhibiting ADAM10 in HEK293-APPswe cells; therefore, MTERF4 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD.",

Two late-onset AD risk factors, Bin1 and CD2AP, are regulators of endocytic trafficking, but it is unclear how their endocytic function regulates Abeta generation in neurons. We identify a novel neuron-specific polarisation of Abeta generation controlled by Bin1 and CD2AP We discover that Bin1 and CD2AP control Abeta generation in axonal and dendritic early endosomes, respectively. Both Bin1 loss of function and CD2AP loss of function raise Abeta generation by increasing APP and BACE1 convergence in early endosomes, however via distinct sorting events. When Bin1 levels are reduced, BACE1 is trapped in tubules of early endosomes and fails to recycle in axons. When CD2AP levels are reduced, APP is trapped at the limiting membrane of early endosomes and fails to be sorted for degradation in dendrites. Hence, Bin1 and CD2AP keep APP and BACE1 apart in early endosomes by distinct mechanisms in axon and dendrites. Individuals carrying variants of either factor would slowly accumulate Abeta in neurons increasing the risk for late-onset AD.",

A water-soluble VIEgen with a red fluorescence emission shows a pronounced, blue-shifted emission with Abeta peptide monomers and fibrils. The enhancement in blue fluorescence can be ascribed to the restriction of the molecular vibration by selectively binding to Abeta. We determine an increasing blue-to-red emission ratio of the VIEgen with both the concentration and fibrogenesis time of Abeta, thereby enabling a ratiometric detection of Abeta in its different morphological forms. Importantly, the VIEgen was proven to be suitable for the fluorescence imaging of small Abeta plaques in the hippocampus of a transgenic mouse brain (five months old), with the blue and red emissions well overlapped on the Abeta. This research offers a new rationale to design molecular VIE probes for biological applications.",

    "title": "The Brain's Structural Connectome Mediates the Relationship between Regional Neuroimaging Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), one of the most common causes of dementia in adults, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder exhibiting well-defined neuropathological hallmarks. It is known that disease pathology involves misfolded amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau proteins, and exhibits a relatively stereotyped progression over decades. The relationship between AD neuropathological hallmarks (Abeta, hypometabolism, and tau proteins) and imaging biomarkers (MRI, AV-45/FDG-PET) is not fully understood. In addition, biomarker pathologies are oftentimes discordant, wherein it may show varying levels of abnormality across brain regions. Evidence based on recent elucidation of trans-neuronal \"prion-like\" transmission and other available data already suggests that disease spread follows the brain's fiber connectivity network. Thereby, the brain's connectome information can be used to predict the process of disease spread in AD. A recently established mathematical model of AD pathology spread using a connectome-based network diffusion model was successful in encapsulating neurodegenerative progression. Motivated by these network-based findings, the current study explores whether and how network connectivity mediates the interactions between various AD biomarkers. We hypothesized that the structural connectivity matrix will mediate the cross-sectional association between regional AD-associated hypometabolism and Abeta deposition. Given recent reports of inherent or lifetime activity of brain regions as strong predictors of Abeta deposition in patients, we also tested whether healthy metabolism exerts a network-mediated effect on Abeta deposition and hypometabolism in AD patients. We found that regional Abeta deposition is best predicted by a linear combination of both regional healthy local metabolism and connectome-mediated regional healthy metabolism.",

    "title": "Efficacy and Safety of Plasma Exchange with 5% Albumin to Modify Cerebrospinal Fluid and Plasma Amyloid-beta Concentrations and Cognition Outcomes in Alzheimer's Disease Patients: A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies conducted in animal models and humans suggest the presence of a dynamic equilibrium of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma compartments. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether plasma exchange (PE) with albumin replacement was able to modify Abeta concentrations in CSF and plasma as well as to improve cognition in patients with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized, patient- and rater-blind, controlled, parallel-group, phase II study, 42 AD patients were assigned (1 : 1) to PE treatment or control (sham) groups. Treated patients received a maximum of 18 PE with 5% albumin (Albutein , Grifols) with three different schedules: two PE/weekly (three weeks), one PE/weekly (six weeks), and one PE/bi- weekly (12 weeks), plus a six-month follow-up period. Plasma and CSF Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 levels, as well as cognitive, functional, and behavioral measures were determined. RESULTS: CSF Abeta1-42 levels after the last PE compared to baseline were marginally higher in PE-treated group versus controls (adjusted means of variation: 75.3 versus -45.5 pg/mL; 95% CI: -19.8, 170.5 versus 135.1, 44.2; p = 0.072). Plasma Abeta1-42 levels were lower in the PE-treated group after each treatment period (p < 0.05). Plasma Abeta1-40 levels showed a saw-tooth pattern variation associated with PE. PE-treated patients scored better in the Boston Naming Test and Semantic Verbal Fluency (p < 0.05) throughout the study. Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores were higher in controls during the PE phase (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: PE with human albumin modified CSF and plasma Abeta1-42 levels. Patients treated with PE showed improvement in memory and language functions, which persisted after PE was discontinued.",

    "abstract": "Nitric oxide can attack thiol groups of cysteine residues in proteins and induce protein cysteine S-nitrosylation. Cholinergic and glutamatergic systems are dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease. Vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) are important in packaging acetylcholine and glutamate into vesicles, which is an important step for neurotransmission. Previously we found that VAChT and VGLUT1 can be nitrosylated and that S-nitrosylation of these transporters inhibits vesicular uptake of acetylcholine and glutamate. To understand the role of VAChT and VGLUT1 nitrosylation in the pathophysiological development of Alzheimer's disease, we analyzed nitrosylation of VAChT and VGLUT1 in brain of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) double transgenic mice, an animal model for Alzheimer's disease. Using a Morris water maze test, we found that 9- and 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice showed memory deficit, compared to wild type mice. We further found that total protein nitrosylation was increased in frontal cortex and hippocampus of 9- and 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice. Although nitrosylation of VAChT and VGLUT1 was not changed in hippocampus of 9- and 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice, nitrosylation of VAChT and VGLUT1 was significantly increased in frontal cortex of APP/PS1 mice at these ages. We also found that nitrosylation of VAChT and VGLUT1 was increased in hippocampus (but not frontal cortex) of 3-month-old APP/PS1 mice. These findings suggest that nitrosylation of VAChT and VGLUT1 may be associated with dysfunctional acetylcholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Cholinergic Modification of Neurogenesis and Gliosis Improves the Memory of AbetaPPswe/PSEN1dE9 Alzheimer's Disease Model Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet.",
    "abstract": "We previously reported that neuroinflammation contributes to the amnesia of AbetaPPswe/PSEN1dE9 Alzheimer's disease model mice fed a high-fat diet to induce type-2 diabetes (T2DM-AD mice), but the underlying mechanism for the memory decline remained unclear. Recent studies have suggested that cholinergic modulation is involved in neuroinflammatory cellular reactions including neurogenesis and gliosis, and in memory improvement. In this study, we administered a broad-spectrum cholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine (2 mg/kg/day, s.c.), into T2DM-AD mice for 6 weeks, and evaluated their memory performance, neurogenesis, and neuroinflammatory reactions. By two hippocampal-dependent memory tests, the Morris water maze and contextual fear conditioning, rivastigmine improved the memory deterioration of the T2DM-AD mice (n = 8, p < 0.01). The number of newborn neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was 1138+-324 (Ave+-SEM) in wild-type littermates, 2573+-442 in T2DM-AD-Vehicle, and 2165+-300 in T2DM-AD-Rivastigmine mice, indicating that neurogenesis was accelerated in the two T2DM-AD groups (n = 5, p < 0.05). The dendritic maturation of new neurons in T2DM-AD-Vehicle mice was severely abrogated, and rivastigmine treatment reversed this retarded maturation. In addition, the hippocampus of T2DM-AD-Vehicle mice showed increased proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha and gliosis, and rivastigmine treatment blocked these inflammatory reactions. Rivastigmine did not change the insulin abnormality or amyloid pathology in these mice. Thus, cholinergic modulation by rivastigmine treatment led to enhanced neurogenesis and the suppression of gliosis, which together ameliorated the memory decline in T2DM-AD model mice.",

    "title": "Increased Transforming Growth Factor beta2 in the Neocortex of Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies is Correlated with Disease Severity and Soluble Abeta42 Load.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Of the three transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta isoforms known, TGFbeta1 deficits have been widely reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and studied as a potential therapeutic target. In contrast, the status of TGFbeta2, which has been shown to mediate amyloid-beta (Abeta)-mediated neuronal death, are unclear both in AD and in Lewy body dementias (LBD) with differential neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle burden. OBJECTIVE: To measure neocortical TGFbeta2 levels and their correlations with neuropathological and clinical markers of disease severity in a well-characterized cohort of AD as well as two clinical subtypes of LBD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), known to manifest relatively high and low Abeta plaque burden, respectively. METHODS: Postmortem samples from temporal cortex (BA21) were measured for TGFbeta2 using a Luminex-based platform, and correlated with scores for neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, alpha-synuclein pathology, dementia severity (as measured by annual decline of Mini-Mental State Examination scores) as well as soluble and total fractions of brain Abeta42. RESULTS: TGFbeta2 was significantly increased in AD and DLB, but not in PDD. TGFbeta2 also correlated with scores for neurofibrillary tangles, Lewy bodies (within the LBD group), dementia severity, and soluble Abeta42 concentration, but not with neuritic plaque scores, total Abeta42, or monomeric alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity. CONCLUSIONS: TGFbeta2 is increased in the temporal cortex of AD and DLB, and its correlations with neuropathological and clinical markers of disease severity as well as with soluble Abeta42 load suggest a potential pathogenic role in mediating the neurotoxicity of non-fibrillar Abeta. Our study also indicates the potential utility of targeting TGFbeta2 in pharmacotherapeutic approaches to AD and DLB.",

Herein, we describe the computational approach for the assessment of inhibitory activity against Abeta aggregation. The influence of novel inhibitors on amyloid Abeta17-42 was studied by employing of molecular docking and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We found that the number of intermolecular backbone hydrogen bonds at the end of 100ns MD simulation was correlated with the level of anti-aggregation potency of studied compounds.

    "title": "Differential copper binding to alpha-synuclein and its disease-associated mutants affect the aggregation and amyloid formation.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Copper is an essential trace element required for the proper functioning of various enzymes present in the central nervous system. An imbalance in the copper homeostasis results in the pathology of various neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's Disease. Hence, residue specific interaction of Cu2+ to alpha-Syn along with the familial mutants H50Q and G51D needs to be studied in detail. METHODS: We investigated the residue specific mapping of Cu2+ binding sites and binding strength using solution-state NMR and ITC respectively. The aggregation kinetics, secondary structural changes, and morphology of the formed fibrils in the presence and absence of Cu2+ were studied using fluorescence, CD, and AFM respectively. RESULTS: Copper binding to alpha-Syn takes place at three different sites with a higher affinity for the region 48-53. While one of the sites got abolished in the case of H50Q, the mutant G51D showed a binding pattern similar to WT. The aggregation kinetics of these proteins in the presence of Cu2+ showed an enhanced rate of fibril formation with a pronounced effect for G51D. CONCLUSION: Cu2+ binding results in the destabilization of long-range tertiary interactions in alpha-Syn leading to the exposure of highly amyloidogenic NAC region which results in the increased rate of fibril formation. Although the residues 48-53 have a stronger affinity for Cu2+ in case of WT and G51D, the binding is not responsible for enhancing the rate of fibril formation in case of H50Q. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These findings will help in the better understanding of Cu2+ catalyzed aggregation of synucleins.",

However, understanding how these genes are involved in the pathophysiology of AD is one of the main challenges of the \"post-GWAS\" era. At least 123 genes are located within the 19 susceptibility loci; hence, a conventional approach (studying the genes one by one) would not be time- and cost-effective. We therefore developed a genome-wide, high-content siRNA screening approach and used it to assess the functional impact of gene under-expression on APP metabolism. We found that 832 genes modulated APP metabolism. Eight of these genes were located within AD susceptibility loci. Only FERMT2 (a beta3-integrin co-activator) was also significantly associated with a variation in cerebrospinal fluid Abeta peptide levels in 2886 AD cases. Lastly, we showed that the under-expression of FERMT2 increases Abeta peptide production by raising levels of mature APP at the cell surface and facilitating its recycling. Taken as a whole, our data suggest that FERMT2 modulates the AD risk by regulating APP metabolism and Abeta peptide production.",

We introduce an approach to study the influence of systematic sidechain modification at this residue, employing chirality as a structural probe. Circular dichroism experiments reveal that charge-preserving alterations of the amino acid sidechain attenuate the characteristic random coil to beta-sheet transition associated with the wildtype peptide. Removal of the negative charge from residue 22, a trait observed with all known familial mutations at this residue, gives rise to a peptide with limited random coil propensity and high beta-sheet characteristics.

Therefore, we were looking for an assay system that can be used for heme concentration determination. From a biochemical point of view the peroxidase activity of the Abeta-heme complex seemed quite attractive to pursue this goal. As a consequence, a peptide that is able to increase the readout even in the case of a low heme concentration is favorable. The examination of Abeta- and non-Abeta-derived peptides in complex with heme revealed that the peroxidase-like activity significantly depends on the peptide sequence and length. A 23mer His-based peptide derived from human fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 in complex with heme exhibited a significantly higher peroxidase activity than Abeta(40)-heme. Structural modeling of both complexes demonstrated that heme binding via a histidine can be supported by hydrogen bond interactions of a basic residue near the propionate carboxyl function of protoporphyrin IX. Furthermore, the interplay of Abeta-heme and the lipoprotein LDL as a potential physiological effector of Abeta was examined.",

    "title": "Neuropathological and genetic correlates of survival and dementia onset in synucleinopathies: a retrospective analysis.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Great heterogeneity exists in survival and the interval between onset of motor symptoms and dementia symptoms across synucleinopathies. We aimed to identify genetic and pathological markers that have the strongest association with these features of clinical heterogeneity in synucleinopathies. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we examined symptom onset, and genetic and neuropathological data from a cohort of patients with Lewy body disorders with autopsy-confirmed alpha synucleinopathy (as of Oct 1, 2015) who were previously included in other studies from five academic institutions in five cities in the USA. We used histopathology techniques and markers to assess the burden of tau neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, alpha-synuclein inclusions, and other pathological changes in cortical regions. These samples were graded on an ordinal scale and genotyped for variants associated with synucleinopathies. We assessed the interval from onset of motor symptoms to onset of dementia, and overall survival in groups with varying levels of comorbid Alzheimer's disease pathology according to US National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association neuropathological criteria, and used multivariate regression to control for age at death and sex. FINDINGS: On the basis of data from 213 patients who had been followed up to autopsy and met inclusion criteria of Lewy body disorder with autopsy-confirmed alpha synucleinopathy, we identified 49 (23%) patients with no Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, 56 (26%) with low-level Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, 45 (21%) with intermediate-level Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, and 63 (30%) with high-level Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. As levels of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology increased, cerebral alpha-synuclein scores were higher, and the interval between onset of motor and dementia symptoms and disease duration was shorter (p<0 0001 for all comparisons). Multivariate regression showed independent negative associations of cerebral tau neurofibrillary tangles score with the interval between onset of motor and dementia symptoms (beta -4 0, 95% CI -5 5 to -2 6; p<0 0001; R2 0 22, p<0 0001) and with survival (-2 0, -3 2 to -0 8; 0 003; 0 15, <0 0001) in models that included age at death, sex, cerebral neuritic plaque scores, cerebral alpha-synuclein scores, presence of cerebrovascular disease, MAPT haplotype, and APOE genotype as covariates. INTERPRETATION: Alzheimer's disease neuropathology is common in synucleinopathies and confers a worse prognosis for each increasing level of neuropathological change. Cerebral neurofibrillary tangles burden, in addition to alpha-synuclein pathology and amyloid plaque pathology, are the strongest pathological predictors of a shorter interval between onset of motor and dementia symptoms and survival. Diagnostic criteria based on reliable biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease neuropathology in synucleinopathies should help to identify the most appropriate patients for clinical trials of emerging therapies targeting tau, amyloid-beta or alpha synuclein, and to stratify them by level of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology.

    "title": "Distribution of cellular HSV-1 receptor expression in human brain.",
    "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a neurotropic virus linked to a range of acute and chronic neurological disorders affecting distinct regions of the brain. Unusually, HSV-1 entry into cells requires the interaction of viral proteins glycoprotein D (gD) and glycoprotein B (gB) with distinct cellular receptor proteins. Several different gD and gB receptors have been identified, including TNFRSF14/HVEM and PVRL1/nectin 1 as gD receptors and PILRA, MAG, and MYH9 as gB receptors. We investigated the expression of these receptor molecules in different areas of the adult and developing human brain using online transcriptome databases. Whereas all HSV-1 receptors showed distinct expression patterns in different brain areas, the Allan Brain Atlas (ABA) reported increased expression of both gD and gB receptors in the hippocampus. Specifically, for PVRL1, TNFRFS14, and MYH9, the differential z scores for hippocampal expression, a measure of relative levels of increased expression, rose to 2.9, 2.9, and 2.5, respectively, comparable to the z score for the archetypical hippocampus-enriched mineralocorticoid receptor (NR3C2, z = 3.1). These data were confirmed at the Human Brain Transcriptome (HBT) database, but HBT data indicate that MAG expression is also enriched in hippocampus. The HBT database allowed the developmental pattern of expression to be investigated; we report that all HSV1 receptors markedly increase in expression levels between gestation and the postnatal/adult periods. These results suggest that differential receptor expression levels of several HSV-1 gD and gB receptors in the adult hippocampus are likely to underlie the susceptibility of this brain region to HSV-1 infection.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta is one of the peptides involved in the onset of Alzheimer's disease, yet the structure of the toxic species and its underlying mechanism remain elusive on account of the dynamic nature of the Abeta oligomerisation process. While it has been reported that incubation of Amyloid beta (1-42) sequences (Abeta42) lead to formation of aggregates that vary in morphology and toxicity, we demonstrate that addition of a discrete macrocyclic host molecule, cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]), substantially reduces toxicity in the neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y. The macrocycle preferentially targets Phe residues in Abeta42 complexing them in a 2 : 1 fashion in neighboring peptide strands. A small but significant structural 'switch' occurs, which induces an increased aggregation rate, suggesting a different cell-uptake mechanism for Abeta42 in the presence of CB[8]. Dramatically increasing the rate of Abeta42 aggregation with CB[8] bypasses the toxic, oligomeric state offering an alternative approach to counter Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Decrease of Amyloid-beta Levels by Curcumin Derivative via Modulation of Amyloid-beta Protein Precursor Trafficking.",
    "abstract": "The abnormal production and deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is a pathologic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Abeta is generated from amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) by two sequential proteolytic cleavage steps involving beta- and gamma-secretases in the trans-Golgi network and endosomes. Since direct inhibition of secretase could induce undesirable side-effects due to inadvertent inhibition of unrelated secretase substrates, it is important to establish methods for inhibiting Abeta production that do not affect secretase activity. It has been suggested that curcumin may have potent anti-amyloidogenic effect. In the present study, we evaluate the effect of curcumin derivatives on Abeta production in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and in CHO cells which stably express human AbetaPP (CHO-AbetaPP). We found that the curcumin derivative CU6 was more effective than curcumin itself in reducing Abeta secretion. We further found that in SH-SY5Y cells CU6 inhibited neither beta- nor gamma-secretase activity, and that increased amounts of immature forms of AbetaPP accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We also found that CU6 induced expression of the ER chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), and enhanced formation of the AbetaPP/GRP78 complex. These results suggest that CU6 downregulates intracellular AbetaPP trafficking, resulting in suppression of Abeta production independently of secretase activity.",

    "title": "Hypoxia/ischemia activate processing of Amyloid Precursor Protein: impact of vascular dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with deficiencies in cerebrovascular functions, e.g. reduced cerebral blood flow and capillary amyloid angiopathy, both of which are evident during the early phase of AD, thus local hypoxia/ischemia could augment the pathogenesis of AD. There is abundant literature revealing that exposures to hypoxia/ischemia increase the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) leading to the accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides in brain. This hypoxia-induced response has been attributed to a significant increase in the activities of beta- and gamma-secretases, whereas alpha-secretase activity decreases in hypoxia. Recent studies have indicated that hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) stimulates the transcription of the beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) gene through the hypoxia-response element in the BACE1 promoter. Moreover, HIF-1alpha protein can directly interact with the gamma-secretase complex and increase its activity in a non-transcriptional manner. Hypoxia/ischemia also trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress and impair autophagy in brain, which consequently can stimulate the expression of presenilin 1 (PS1) and activate gamma-secretase. Subsequently, PS1 protein can stabilize HIF-1alpha protein and in addition, APP intracellular domain peptide is able to induce the expression of HIF-1alpha. The activation of beta- and gamma-secretases is an evolutionarily conserved hypoxia response, e.g. it is also present in zebrafish. Given that beta- and gamma-secretases have many substrates in addition to APP, one could postulate that AD pathology is a byproduct of the rescue process mediated by these two aspartyl proteinases under hypoxic/ischemic conditions. We will review the recent evidence indicating that vascular dysfunctions can provoke AD pathology by activating beta- and gamma-secretases.",

    "title": "Associations Between beta-Amyloid Kinetics and the beta-Amyloid Diurnal Pattern in the Central Nervous System.",
    "abstract": "Importance: Recent studies found that the concentration of amyloid-beta (Abeta) fluctuates with the sleep-wake cycle. Although the amplitude of this day/night pattern attenuates with age and amyloid deposition, to our knowledge, the association of Abeta kinetics (ie, production, turnover, and clearance) with this oscillation has not been studied. Objective: To determine the association between Abeta kinetics, age, amyloid levels, and the Abeta day/night pattern in humans. Design, Setting, and Participants: We measured Abeta concentrations and kinetics in 77 adults aged 60 to 87 years with and without amyloid deposition by a novel precise mass spectrometry method at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, Missouri. We compared findings of 2 orthogonal methods, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and mass spectrometry, to validate the day/night patterns and determine more precise estimates of the cosinor parameters. In vivo labeling of central nervous system proteins with stable isotopically labeled leucine was performed, and kinetics of Abeta40 and Abeta42 were measured. Interventions: Serial cerebrospinal fluid collection via indwelling lumbar catheter over 36 to 48 hours before, during, and after in vivo labeling, with a 9-hour primed constant infusion of 13C6-leucine. Main Outcomes and Measures: The amplitude, linear increase, and other cosinor measures of each participant's serial cerebrospinal fluid Abeta concentrations and Abeta turnover rates. Results: Of the 77 participants studied, 46 (59.7%) were men, and the mean (range) age was 72.6 (60.4-87.7) years. Day/night patterns in Abeta concentrations were more sharply defined by the precise mass spectrometry method than by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (mean difference of SD of residuals: Abeta40, -7.42 pM; P < .001; Abeta42, -3.72 pM; P < .001). Amyloid deposition diminished day/night amplitude and linear increase of Abeta42 but not of Abeta40. Increased age diminished day/night amplitude of both Abeta40 and Abeta42. After controlling for amyloid deposition, amplitude of Abeta40 was positively associated with production rates (r = 0.42; P < .001), while the linear rise was associated with turnover rates (r = 0.28; P < .05). The amplitude and linear rise of Abeta42 were both associated with turnover (r = -0.38; P < .001) and production (r = 0.238; P < .05) rates. Conclusions and Relevance: Amyloid deposition is associated with premature loss of normal Abeta42 day/night patterns in older adults, suggesting the previously reported effects of age and amyloid on Abeta42 amplitude at least partially affect each other. Production and turnover rates suggest that day/night Abeta patterns are modulated by both production and clearance mechanisms active in sleep-wake cycles and that amyloid deposition may impair normal circadian patterns. These findings may be important for the designs of future secondary prevention trials for Alzheimer disease.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence implicates antiretroviral (ARV) drugs as potential contributors to the persistence and evolution of clinical and pathological presentation of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in the post-ARV era. Based on their ability to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in various cell types, we hypothesized that ARV-mediated ER stress in the central nervous system resulted in chronic dysregulation of the unfolded protein response and altered amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. We used in vitro and in vivo models to show that HIV protease inhibitor (PI) class ARVs induced neuronal damage and ER stress, leading to PKR-like ER kinase-dependent phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha and enhanced translation of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1). In addition, PIs induced beta-amyloid production, indicative of increased BACE1-mediated APP processing, in rodent neuroglial cultures and human APP-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells. Inhibition of BACE1 activity protected against neuronal damage. Finally, ARVs administered to mice and SIV-infected macaques resulted in neuronal damage and BACE1 up-regulation in the central nervous system. These findings implicate a subset of PIs as potential mediators of neurodegeneration in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is most common neurodegenerative disorder and is characterized by increased production of soluble amyloid-beta oligomers, the main toxic species predominantly formed from aggregation of monomeric amyloid-beta (Abeta). Increased production of Abeta invokes a cascade of oxidative damages to neurons and eventually leads to neuronal death. This study was aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of a beta-sheet breaker alpha/beta-hybrid peptide (BSBHp) and the underlying mechanisms against Abeta40 -induced neurotoxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Cells were pretreated with the peptide Abeta40 to induce neurotoxicity. Assays for cell viability, cell membrane damage, cellular apoptosis, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), intracellular free Ca2+ , and key apoptotic protein levels were performed in vitro. Our results showed that pretreatment with BSBHp significantly attenuates Abeta40 -induced toxicity by retaining cell viability, suppressing generation of ROS, Ca2+ levels, and effectively protects neuronal apoptosis by suppressing pro-apoptotic protein Bax and up-regulating antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. These results suggest that alpha/beta-hybrid peptide has neuroprotective effects against Abeta40 -induced oxidative stress, which might be a potential therapeutic agent for treating or preventing neurodegenerative diseases.",

These proteins undergo a spontaneous transition from a soluble, often partially folded form, into insoluble amyloid fibrils that are rich in beta-sheets. Increasing evidence suggests that highly dynamic, polydisperse folding intermediates, which occur during fibril formation, are the toxic species in the amyloid-related diseases. Traditional condensed-phase methods are of limited use for characterizing these states because they typically only provide ensemble averages rather than information about individual oligomers. Here we report the first direct secondary-structure analysis of individual amyloid intermediates using a combination of ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry and gas-phase infrared spectroscopy. Our data reveal that oligomers of the fibril-forming peptide segments VEALYL and YVEALL, which consist of 4-9 peptide strands, can contain a significant amount of beta-sheet. In addition, our data show that the more-extended variants of each oligomer generally exhibit increased beta-sheet content.",

    "abstract": "Calnuc is a ubiquitously expressed protein of the EF-hand Ca2+-binding superfamily. Previous studies have implicated it in Ca2+-sensitive physiological processes, whereas details of its function and involvement in human diseases are lacking. Drawing upon the sequence homology of calnuc with calreticulin, we propose it functions as a molecular chaperone-like protein. In cells under thermal, chemical [urea and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl)], and acidic stress, calnuc exhibits properties similar to those of established chaperone-like proteins (GRP78, spectrin, and alpha-crystallin), effectively demonstrated by its ability to suppress aggregation of malate dehydrogenase (MDH), alcohol dehydrogenase, and catalase. Calnuc aids in refolding of MDH with retention of 80% of its enzymatic activity. In HEK293 cells subjected to heat shock, calnuc chaperones luciferase, protecting its activity. Our in vitro and cell culture results establish the ability of calnuc to inhibit fibrillation of insulin and lysozyme and validate its neuroprotective role in cells treated with amyloid fibrils. Calnuc also rescues cells from fibrillar toxicity (caused by misfolded or aggregated proteins), providing a plausible explanation for the previous observation of its low level of expression in brains affected by Alzheimer's disease. We propose that calnuc is possibly involved in controlling protein unfolding diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), prion disease, and type II diabetes.",

    "title": "Stabilization, Assembly, and Toxicity of Trimers Derived from Abeta.",
    "abstract": "Oligomers of the beta-amyloid peptide Abeta have emerged as important contributors to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Mounting evidence suggests that Abeta trimers and higher-order oligomers derived from trimers have special significance in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Elucidating the structures of these trimers and higher-order oligomers is paramount for understanding their role in neurodegeneration. This paper describes the design, synthesis, X-ray crystallographic structures, and biophysical and biological properties of two stabilized trimers derived from the central and C-terminal regions of Abeta. These triangular trimers are stabilized through three disulfide cross-links between the monomer subunits. The X-ray crystallographic structures reveal that the stabilized trimers assemble hierarchically to form hexamers, dodecamers, and annular porelike structures. Solution-phase biophysical studies reveal that the stabilized trimers assemble in solution to form oligomers that recapitulate some of the higher-order assemblies observed crystallographically. The stabilized trimers share many of the biological characteristics of oligomers of full-length Abeta, including toxicity toward a neuronally derived human cell line, activation of caspase-3 mediated apoptosis, and reactivity with the oligomer-specific antibody A11. These studies support the biological significance of the triangular trimer assembly of Abeta beta-hairpins and may offer a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease.",

The objective of this study was to test the effectiveness of T1w/T2w image ratios as an easily accessible biomarker for amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation. We performed the T1w/T2w analysis in cognitively normal elderly individuals. We applied [11C] Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET to the same individuals, and Abeta deposition was quantified by its binding potential (PiB-BPND). The subjects were divided into low and high PiB-BPND groups, and group differences in regional T1w/T2w values were evaluated. In the regions where we found a significant group difference, we conducted a correlation analysis between regional T1w/T2w values and PiB-BPND. Subjects with high global cortical PiB-BPND showed a significantly higher regional T1w/T2w ratio in the frontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. We found a significant positive relationship between the regional T1w/T2w ratio and Abeta accumulation. Moreover, with a T1w/T2w ratio of 0.55 in the medial frontal regions, we correctly discriminated subjects with high PiB-BPND from the entire subject population with a sensitivity of 84.6% and specificity of 80.0%. Our results indicate that early Abeta-induced pathological changes can be detected using the T1w/T2w ratio on MRI. We believe that the T1w/T2w ratio is a prospective stable biological marker of early Abeta accumulation in cognitively normal individuals. The availability of such an accessible marker would improve the efficiency of clinical trials focusing on the initial disease stages by reducing the number of subjects who require screening by Abeta-PET scan or lumbar puncture.",

Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation triggered by Abeta is responsible for retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction in the onset of AMD; however, the detailed molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the involvement of NADPH oxidase- and mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the process of Abeta1-40 -induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LPS-primed ARPE-19 cells. The results showed that Abeta1-40 could induce excessive ROS generation, MAPK/NF-kappaB signaling activation and subsequently NLRP3 inflammasome activation in LPS-primed ARPE-19 cells. Furthermore, the inductive effect of Abeta1-40 on NLRP3 inflammasome activation was mediated in a manner dependent on NADPH oxidase- and mitochondria-derived ROS. Our findings may provide a novel insight into the molecular mechanism by which Abeta contributes to the early-stage AMD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by deposition of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation. In order to study microglial contribution to amyloid plaque phagocytosis, we developed a novel ex vivo model by co-culturing organotypic brain slices from up to 20-month-old, amyloid-bearing AD mouse model (APPPS1) and young, neonatal wild-type (WT) mice. Surprisingly, co-culturing resulted in proliferation, recruitment, and clustering of old microglial cells around amyloid plaques and clearance of the plaque halo. Depletion of either old or young microglial cells prevented amyloid plaque clearance, indicating a synergistic effect of both populations. Exposing old microglial cells to conditioned media of young microglia or addition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was sufficient to induce microglial proliferation and reduce amyloid plaque size. Our data suggest that microglial dysfunction in AD may be reversible and their phagocytic ability can be modulated to limit amyloid accumulation. This novel ex vivo model provides a valuable system for identification, screening, and testing of compounds aimed to therapeutically reinforce microglial phagocytosis.",

    "title": "Tribbles Pseudokinase 3 Induces Both Apoptosis and Autophagy in Amyloid-beta-induced Neuronal Death.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced neuron death is considered central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among several death modalities, autophagy and apoptosis play important roles in Abeta-induced neuron death suggesting that there may be regulatory mechanisms that initiate both cell death pathways. However, molecules that govern both pathways have not been identified. Here, we report that, upon Abeta treatment, tribbles pseudokinase 3 (Trib3, an ortholog of Drosophila Tribbles) is up-regulated in neurons both in vivo and in vitro Increased Trib3 levels inhibited the activity of the kinase Akt by interacting with it. As a result, forkhead box O1 (FoxO1), a transcription factor that is negatively regulated by Akt, was activated, translocated to the nucleus, and induced the pro-apoptotic gene BCL2-like 11 (Bim). Conversely, FoxO1 responded to Abeta insult by binding to the Trib3 gene promoter, enhancing its expression. Our investigations further revealed that Trib3 also induces autophagy. We found that Trib3 indirectly activates unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase1 (Ulk1) by impeding phosphorylation of, and thus inactivating, a negative regulator of Ulk1, mechanistic target of rapamycin. Ulk1 activation augmented autophagosome formation and reduced autophagy flux. Thus, Trib3 was required for formation of autophagosomes, which accumulated in neurons as autophagic flux was thwarted. Most importantly, silencing endogenous Trib3 strongly protected neurons from Abeta insult. Our results suggest that a self-amplifying feed-forward loop among Trib3, Akt, and FoxO1 in Abeta-treated neurons induces both apoptosis and autophagy, culminating in neuron death. Thus, Trib3 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for AD.",

The use of chemical kinetics has recently enabled highly accurate quantifications of the effects of small molecules on specific microscopic steps in Abeta42 aggregation. Here, we exploit this approach to develop a rational drug discovery strategy against Abeta42 aggregation that uses as a read-out the changes in the nucleation and elongation rate constants caused by candidate small molecules. We thus identify a pool of compounds that target specific microscopic steps in Abeta42 aggregation. We then test further these small molecules in human cerebrospinal fluid and in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of AD. Our results show that this strategy represents a powerful approach to identify systematically small molecule lead compounds, thus offering an appealing opportunity to reduce the attrition problem in drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition, neurofibrillary tangles and cognitive decline. Clinical data suggests that both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are risk factors for AD-related dementia and several clinical studies have demonstrated that AD patients show alterations in peripheral glucose regulation characterized by insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemia) or hypoinsulinemia. Whether animal models of AD exhibit a pre-diabetic phenotype without additional dietary or experimental manipulation is unclear however, with contradictory data available. Further, most studies have not examined the time course of potential pre-diabetic changes relative to AD pathogenesis and cognitive decline. Thus, in this study we tested the hypothesis that a pre-diabetic phenotype (peripheral metabolic dysregulation) exists in the APP/PS1 transgenic model of AD under normal conditions and precedes AD-related pathology. Specifically, we examined glucose tolerance in male APP/PS1 mice on a C57BL/6J congenic background at 2, 4-6 and 8-9months of age by assessing fasting glucose levels, glucose tolerance, plasma insulin levels and insulin sensitivity as well as the development of pathological characteristics of AD and verified that our APP/PS1 mice develop cognitive impairment. Here we show that APP/PS1 mice, compared to wild-type controls, exhibit a significant impairment in glucose tolerance during an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (ipGTT) and a trend for increased fasting plasma insulin concentrations as early as 2months of age, while extracellular Abeta1-42 deposition occurs later and cognitive decline exists at 8-9months of age. Moreover, APP/PS1 mice did not respond as well to exogenous insulin as the wild-type controls during an intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test (ipITT). Taken together, these data reveal that male APP/PS1 mice on a C57BL/6J congenic background exhibit a pre-diabetic phenotype prior to the development of AD-like pathology and that this metabolic deficit persists when they exhibit neuropathology and cognitive decline. This raises the question of whether altered glucose regulation and insulin production/secretion could contribute to AD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to stress during the sensitive period of early-life increases the risk to develop cognitive impairments and psychopathology later in life. In addition, early-life stress (ES) exposure, next to genetic causes, has been proposed to modulate the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), however evidence for this hypothesis is currently lacking. We here tested whether ES modulates progression of AD-related neuropathology and assessed the possible contribution of neuroinflammatory factors in this. We subjected wild-type (WT) and transgenic APP/PS1 mice, as a model for amyloid neuropathology, to chronic ES from postnatal day (P)2 to P9. We next studied how ES exposure affected; 1) amyloid beta (Abeta) pathology at an early (4month old) and at a more advanced pathological (10month old) stage, 2) neuroinflammatory mediators immediately after ES exposure as well as in adult WT mice, and 3) the neuroinflammatory response in relation to Abeta neuropathology. ES exposure resulted in a reduction of cell-associated amyloid in 4month old APP/PS1 mice, but in an exacerbation of Abeta plaque load at 10months of age, demonstrating that ES affects Abeta load in the hippocampus in an age-dependent manner. Interestingly, ES modulated various neuroinflammatory mediators in the hippocampus of WT mice as well as in response to Abeta neuropathology. In WT mice, immediately following ES exposure (P9), Iba1-immunopositive microglia exhibited reduced complexity and hippocampal interleukin (IL)-1beta expression was increased. In contrast, microglial Iba1 and CD68 were increased and hippocampal IL-6 expression was decreased at 4months, while these changes resolved by 10months of age. Finally, Abeta neuropathology triggered a neuroinflammatory response in APP/PS1 mice that was altered after ES exposure. APP/PS1 mice exhibited increased CD68 expression at 4months, which was further enhanced by ES, whereas the microglial response to Abeta neuropathology, as measured by Iba1 and CD11b, was less prominent after ES at 10months of age. Finally, the hippocampus appears to be more vulnerable for these ES-induced effects, since ES did not affect Abeta neuropathology and neuroinflammation in the entorhinal cortex of adult ES exposed mice. Overall, our results demonstrate that ES exposure has both immediate and lasting effects on the neuroinflammatory response. In the context of AD, such alterations in neuroinflammation might contribute to aggravated neuropathology in ES exposed mice, hence altering disease progression. This indicates that, at least in a genetic context, ES could aggravate AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "Polymorphism of amyloid-beta (Abeta) fibrils, implying different fibril structures, may play important pathological roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Morphologies of Abeta fibrils were found to be sensitive to fibrillation conditions. Herein, the Ser8-phosphorylated Abeta (pAbeta), which is assumed to specially associate with symptomatic AD, is reported to modify the morphology, biophysical properties, cellular toxicity, and structures of Abeta fibrils. Under the same fibrillation conditions, pAbeta favors the formation of fibrils (Fpbeta), which are different from the wild-type Abeta fibrils (Fbeta). Both Fbeta and Fpbeta fibrils show single predominant morphologies. Compared with Fbeta, Fpbeta exhibits higher propagation efficiency and higher neuronal cell toxicity. The residue-specific structural differences between the Fbeta- and Fpbeta-seeded Abeta fibrils were identified using magic angle spin NMR. Our results suggest a potential regulatory mechanism of phosphorylation on Abeta fibril formation in AD and imply that the post-translationally modified Abeta, especially the phosphorylated Abeta, may be an important target for the diagnosis or treatment of AD at specific stages.",

In this study, we generated iPSCs from skin fibroblasts obtained from a healthy individual, as well as sporadic (sAD) and familial AD (fAD, PSEN1-A246E mutation) patients. iPSC lines were differentiated into neuronal precursors (iPSC-NPCs) and neurons that were subjected to amyloid beta (Abeta) toxicity assays. We found that neurons derived from the fAD patient have a higher susceptibility to Abeta1-42 oligomers compared with neurons coming from healthy and sAD individuals.

    "abstract": "Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a nutrient sensor and central controller of cell growth and proliferation, is altered in various models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Even less studied or understood in AD is mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) that influences cellular metabolism, in part through the regulations of Akt/PKB and SGK. Dysregulation of insulin/PI3K/Akt signaling is another important feature of AD pathogenesis. We found that both total mTORC1 and C2 protein levels and individual C1 and C2 enzymatic activities were decreased in human AD brain samples. In two rodent AD models, mTORC1 and C2 activities were also decreased. In a neuronal culture model of AD characterized by accumulation of cellular amyloid-beta (Abeta)42, mTORC1 activity was reduced. Autophagic vesicles and markers were correspondingly increased and new protein synthesis was inhibited, consistent with mTORC1 hypofunction. Interestingly, mTORC2 activity in neural culture seemed resistant to the effects of intracellular amyloid. In various cell lines, Abeta expression provoked insulin resistance, characterized by inhibition of stimulated Akt phosphorylation, and an increase in negative mTORC1 regular, p-AMPK, itself a nutrient sensor. Rapamycin decreased phospho-mTOR and to lesser degree p-Rictor. This further suppression of mTORC1 activity protected cells from Abeta-induced toxicity and insulin resistance. More striking, Rictor over-expression fully reversed the Abeta-effects on primary neuronal cultures. Finally, using in vitro assay, Rictor protein addition completely overcame oligomeric Abeta-induced inhibition of the PDK-Akt activation step. We conclude that striking a new balance by restoring mTORC2 abundance and/or inhibition of mTORC1 has therapeutic potential in AD.",

The worldwide effort to develop peptide-based inhibitors of amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregation can be considered an unplanned combinatorial experiment. An understanding of what has been done and achieved may advance our understanding of AD pathology and the discovery of effective therapeutic agents. We review here the history of such peptide-based inhibitors, including those based on the Abeta sequence and those not derived from that sequence, containing both natural and unnatural amino acid building blocks. Peptide-based aggregation inhibitors hold significant promise for future AD therapy owing to their high selectivity, effectiveness, low toxicity, good tolerance, low accumulation in tissues, high chemical and biological diversity, possibility of rational design, and highly developed methods for analyzing their mode of action, proteolytic stability (modified peptides), and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability.",

    "abstract": "Incipient Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by a slow onset of clinical symptoms, with pathological brain changes starting several years earlier. Consequently, it is necessary to first understand and differentiate age-related changes in brain regions in the absence of disease, and then to support early and accurate AD diagnosis. However, there is poor understanding of the initial stage of AD; seemingly healthy elderly brains lose matter in regions related to AD, but similar changes can also be found in non-demented subjects having mild cognitive impairment (MCI). By using a Linear Mixed Effects approach, we modelled the change of 166 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based biomarkers available at a 5-year follow up on healthy elderly control (HC, n = 46) subjects. We hypothesized that, by identifying their significant variant (vr) and quasi-variant (qvr) brain regions over time, it would be possible to obtain an age-based null model, which would characterize their normal atrophy and growth patterns as well as the correlation between these two regions. By using the null model on those subjects who had been clinically diagnosed as HC (n = 161), MCI (n = 209) and AD (n = 331), normal age-related changes were estimated and deviation scores (residuals) from the observed MRI-based biomarkers were computed. Subject classification, as well as the early prediction of conversion to MCI and AD, were addressed through residual-based Support Vector Machines (SVM) modelling. We found reductions in most cortical volumes and thicknesses (with evident gender differences) as well as in sub-cortical regions, including greater atrophy in the hippocampus. The average accuracies (ACC) recorded for men and women were: AD-HC: 94.11%, MCI-HC: 83.77% and MCI converted to AD (cAD)-MCI non-converter (sMCI): 76.72%. Likewise, as compared to standard clinical diagnosis methods, SVM classifiers predicted the conversion of cAD to be 1.9 years earlier for females (ACC:72.5%) and 1.4 years earlier for males (ACC:69.0%).",

    "abstract": "Fibrillogenesis of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in human brain has been implicated as the main cause of Alzheimer's disease. A few small molecules from natural sources have been discovered for their inhibition effects on Abeta fibrillation, of which (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is one of the most broadly investigated compounds for its potent inhibitory activity. However, in vivo applicability of the inhibitors is largely limited by their low transmembrane efficiency. Hence, it is of great significance to develop inhibition systems that function at low concentrations. In this work, a dual-inhibitor system containing EGCG and negatively charged polymeric nanoparticles (NP10), which was also demonstrated effective on the inhibition of Abeta aggregation, was developed and comprehensively studied by extensive biophysical and biological assays. It was found that the dual-inhibitor system at low concentrations was more effective on the inhibition and detoxification of Abeta (Abeta42 and Abeta40) fibrillation than the additive effects of these two agents working individually. Namely, there was a synergistic effect of the two inhibitors. The synergism factor reached 1.25 with 5muM EGCG and 5mug/mL NP10. Kinetic studies with Abeta40 revealed that the two inhibitors functioned in different Abeta assembling stages: NP10 mainly inhibited primary nucleation, while EGCG suppressed fibril elongation and changed the fibril structure to make it show less seeding activities in the secondary nucleation. NP10 might also help EGCG binding to Abeta, leading to its enhanced inhibitory effects on fibril elongation and secondary nucleation. The synergistic effect observed in the dual-inhibitor system offered new insight into the development of potent inhibitor systems against amyloid neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides into fibrils or other self-assembled states is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Fibrils formed in vitro by 40- and 42-residue amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta40 and Abeta42) are polymorphic, with variations in molecular structure that depend on fibril growth conditions. Recent experiments suggest that variations in amyloid-beta fibril structure in vivo may correlate with variations in Alzheimer's disease phenotype, in analogy to distinct prion strains that are associated with different clinical and pathological phenotypes. Here we investigate correlations between structural variation and Alzheimer's disease phenotype using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) measurements on Abeta40 and Abeta42 fibrils prepared by seeded growth from extracts of Alzheimer's disease brain cortex. We compared two atypical Alzheimer's disease clinical subtypes-the rapidly progressive form (r-AD) and the posterior cortical atrophy variant (PCA-AD)-with a typical prolonged-duration form (t-AD). On the basis of ssNMR data from 37 cortical tissue samples from 18 individuals, we find that a single Abeta40 fibril structure is most abundant in samples from patients with t-AD and PCA-AD, whereas Abeta40 fibrils from r-AD samples exhibit a significantly greater proportion of additional structures. Data for Abeta42 fibrils indicate structural heterogeneity in most samples from all patient categories, with at least two prevalent structures. These results demonstrate the existence of a specific predominant Abeta40 fibril structure in t-AD and PCA-AD, suggest that r-AD may relate to additional fibril structures and indicate that there is a qualitative difference between Abeta40 and Abeta42 aggregates in the brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Tau Isoforms Imbalance Impairs the Axonal Transport of the Amyloid Precursor Protein in Human Neurons.",
    "abstract": "Tau, as a microtubule (MT)-associated protein, participates in key neuronal functions such as the regulation of MT dynamics, axonal transport, and neurite outgrowth. Alternative splicing of exon 10 in the tau primary transcript gives rise to protein isoforms with three (3R) or four (4R) MT binding repeats. Although tau isoforms are balanced in the normal adult human brain, imbalances in 3R:4R ratio have been tightly associated with the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Several studies exploiting tau overexpression and/or mutations suggested that perturbations in tau metabolism impair axonal transport. Nevertheless, no physiological model has yet demonstrated the consequences of altering the endogenous relative content of tau isoforms over axonal transport regulation. Here, we addressed this issue using a trans-splicing strategy that allows modulating tau exon 10 inclusion/exclusion in differentiated human-derived neurons. Upon changes in 3R:4R tau relative content, neurons showed no morphological changes, but live imaging studies revealed that the dynamics of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) were significantly impaired. Single trajectory analyses of the moving vesicles showed that predominance of 3R tau favored the anterograde movement of APP vesicles, increasing anterograde run lengths and reducing retrograde runs and segmental velocities. Conversely, the imbalance toward the 4R isoform promoted a retrograde bias by a significant reduction of anterograde velocities. These findings suggest that changes in 3R:4R tau ratio has an impact on the regulation of axonal transport and specifically in APP dynamics, which might link tau isoform imbalances with APP abnormal metabolism in neurodegenerative processes. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The tau protein has a relevant role in the transport of cargos throughout neurons. Dysfunction in tau metabolism underlies several neurological disorders leading to dementia. In the adult human brain, two tau isoforms are found in equal amounts, whereas changes in such equilibrium have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated the role of tau in human neurons in culture and found that perturbations in the endogenous balance of tau isoforms were sufficient to impair the transport of the Alzheimer's disease-related amyloid precursor protein (APP), although neuronal morphology was normal. Our results provide evidence of a direct relationship between tau isoform imbalance and defects in axonal transport, which induce an abnormal APP metabolism with important implications in neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in brain. In the present study, two familial Abeta42 mutations, namely A2V (harmful) and A2T (protective) have been analyzed and compared with the wild-type (WT) by performing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in the absence and presence of curcumin, a well-known inhibitor of Abeta plaque formation. Mutant A2V was found to exhibit highest stability followed by WT and mutant A2T in the absence of curcumin. This stability trend was found to be reversed in the presence of curcumin, suggesting a significant change in the conformational landscape of Abeta42 folding. Due to significant differences in the folding and interaction patterns of the mutants A2V and A2T, curcumin exhibited higher binding affinity for mutant A2T as compared to that of A2V. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the effect of curcumin binding on structural landscapes of the two contrasting point mutants providing an understanding of the basis of Abeta plaque formation and its prevention by curcumin.",

    "abstract": "Findings from Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models showed that amylin treatment improved AD pathology and enhanced amyloid-beta (Abeta) brain to blood clearance; however, the mechanism was not investigated. Using the Tg2576 AD mouse model, a single intraperitoneal injection of amylin significantly increased Abeta serum levels, and the effect was abolished by AC253, an amylin receptor antagonist, suggesting that amylin effect could be mediated by its receptor. Subsequent mechanistic studies showed amylin enhanced Abeta transport across a cell-based model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), an effect that was abolished when the amylin receptor was inhibited by two amylin antagonists and by siRNA knockdown of amylin receptor Ramp3. To explain this finding, amylin effect on Abeta transport proteins expressed at the BBB was evaluated. Findings indicated that cells treated with amylin induced LRP1 expression, a major receptor involved in brain Abeta efflux, in plasma membrane fraction, suggesting intracellular translocation of LRP1 from the cytoplasmic pool. Increased LRP1 in membrane fraction could explain, at least in part, the enhanced uptake and transport of Abeta across the BBB. Collectively, our findings indicated that amylin induced Abeta brain to blood clearance through amylin receptor by inducing LRP1 subcellular translocation to the plasma membrane of the BBB endothelium.",

Modeling of this pathology in vitro may be useful for studying this phenomenon. In this study, we analyzed three different cultures of neural cells carrying trisomy of chromosome 21, which were generated by directed differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). We report here that in vitro generated DS neural cells have abnormal metabolism of amyloid-beta (Abeta) manifested by increased secretion and accumulation of Abeta granules of Abeta42 pathological isoform with upregulated expression of the APP gene. Additionally, we found increased expression levels of genes that are considered to be associated with AD (BACE2, RCAN1, ETS2, TMED10), as compared to healthy controls. Thus, the neural cells generated from induced pluripotent stem cells with DS reproduce initial cellular signs of AD-type pathology and can be useful tools for modeling and studying this variant of AD in vitro.",

The replicating amyloid (prion) theory, based upon data from studies of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), has been challenged since the prion can be separated from TSE infectivity, and spiroplasma, a wall-less bacterium, has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of CJD. Further support for a microbial cause for AD comes from occurrence of mixed CJD/AD cases involving up to 15% of AD brains submitted to brain banks. The association of CJD with AD suggests a common etiology rather than simply being a medical curiosity. A co-infection with the transmissible agent of CJD, which we propose to be a Spiroplasma sp., would explain the diversity of bacteria shown to be associated with cases of AD.",

However, the molecular basis and mechanism of amyloid aggregation are not completely understood. For many amyloidogenic proteins, certain oligomeric intermediates that form in the early aggregation phase appear to be the principal cause of cellular toxicity. Recent computational studies have suggested the importance of nonspecific interactions for the initiation of the oligomerization process prior to the structural conversion steps and template seeding, particularly at low protein concentrations. Here, using advanced single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging of a model SH3 domain, we obtained direct evidence that nonspecific aggregates are required in a two-step nucleation mechanism of amyloid aggregation. We identified three different oligomeric types according to their sizes and compactness and performed a full mechanistic study that revealed a mandatory rate-limiting conformational conversion step. We also identified the most cytotoxic species, which may be possible targets for inhibiting and preventing amyloid aggregation.",

This provides a window of opportunity to initiate preventive treatment. However, this emphasizes the necessity for biomarkers that identify individuals at risk for developing AD later in life. In this cross-sectional study, originating from three epidemiologic studies in Sweden (n=1428), the objective was to examine whether amyloid pathology, as determined by low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of the 42 amino acid form of beta-amyloid (Abeta42), is associated with biomarker evidence of other pathological changes in cognitively healthy elderly. A total of 129 patients were included and CSF levels of Abeta42, total tau, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau), neurogranin, VILIP-1, VEGF, FABP3, Abeta40, neurofilament light, MBP, orexin A, BDNF and YKL-40 were measured. Among these healthy elderly, 35.6% (N=46) had CSF Abeta42 levels below 530 pg ml-1. These individuals displayed significantly higher CSF concentrations of t-tau (P<0.001), p-tau (181) (P<0.001), neurogranin (P=0.009) and FABP3 (P=0.044) compared with amyloid-negative individuals. Our study indicates that there is a subpopulation among healthy older individuals who have amyloid pathology along with signs of ongoing neuronal and synaptic degeneration, as well as tangle pathology. Previous studies have demonstrated that increase in CSF tau and p-tau is a specific sign of AD progression that occurs downstream of the deposition of Abeta. On the basis of this, our data suggest that these subjects are at risk for developing AD. We also confirm the association between APOE e4 and amyloid pathology in healthy older individuals.",

    "abstract": "One of the most challenging issues in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) caused by HIV-1 virotoxins and drug abuse is the lack of understanding the underlying mechanisms that are commonly associated with disorders of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which mainly consists of brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC). Here, we hypothesized that Glycoprotein 120 (gp120), methamphetamine (METH) and nicotine (NT) can enhance amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation in BMEC through Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 nAChR). Both in vitro (human BMEC) (HBMEC) and in vivo (mice) models of BBB were used to dissect the role of alpha7 nAChR in up-regulation of Abeta induced by gp120, METH and NT. Abeta release from and transport across HBMEC were significantly increased by these factors. Methyllycaconitine (MLA), an antagonist of alpha7 nAChR, could efficiently block these pathogenic effects. Furthermore, our animal data showed that these factors could significantly increase the levels of Abeta, Tau and Ubiquitin C-Terminal Hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) in mouse cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and Abeta in the mouse brains. These pathogenicities were significantly reduced by MLA, suggesting that alpha7 nAChR may play an important role in neuropathology caused by gp120, METH and NT, which are the major pathogenic factors contributing to the pathogenesis of HAND.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression studies suggest that aging of the human brain is determined by a complex interplay of molecular events, although both its region- and cell-type-specific consequences remain poorly understood. Here, we extensively characterized aging-altered gene expression changes across ten human brain regions from 480 individuals ranging in age from 16 to 106 years. We show that astrocyte- and oligodendrocyte-specific genes, but not neuron-specific genes, shift their regional expression patterns upon aging, particularly in the hippocampus and substantia nigra, while the expression of microglia- and endothelial-specific genes increase in all brain regions. In line with these changes, high-resolution immunohistochemistry demonstrated decreased numbers of oligodendrocytes and of neuronal subpopulations in the aging brain cortex. Finally, glial-specific genes predict age with greater precision than neuron-specific genes, thus highlighting the need for greater mechanistic understanding of neuron-glia interactions in aging and late-life diseases.",

    "title": "Relationship between 18F-Flutemetamol uptake and RBANS performance in non-demented community-dwelling older adults.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) has been used extensively for clinical care and in research for patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, relatively few studies have evaluated the relationship between RBANS performance and AD imaging biomarkers. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the association between a relatively new amyloid positron emission tomography imaging biomarker and performance on the RBANS. METHODS: Twenty-seven nondemented community-dwelling adults over the age of 65 underwent 18F-Flutemetamol amyloid- positron emission tomography imaging, along with cognitive testing using the RBANS and select behavioral measures. Partial correlation coefficients were used to identify relationships between the imaging and behavioral markers. RESULTS: After controlling for age and education, amyloid deposition and RBANS Indexes of Immediate Memory, Delayed Memory, and Total Scale score were significantly correlated (p's < .001, r's = -.73 to -.77, d's = 2.13-2.39), with greater amyloid burden being associated with lower RBANS scores. The Delayed Memory Index was particularly highly associated with 18F-Flutemetamol binding (r2 = .59, p < .001, d = 2.39). Neither 18F-Flutemetamol binding nor RBANS performance was significantly correlated with levels of depression, subjective cognitive difficulties, or premorbid intellect. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the limited use of amyloid imaging in clinical settings due to high cost and lack of reimbursement, these findings suggest that in particular RBANS Delayed Memory Index may be a cost-efficient tool to identify early signs of AD pathology, and its use may enlighten clinical decision-making regarding potential progression to dementia due to AD.",

    "title": "Vitamin D3 protects against Abeta peptide cytotoxicity in differentiated human neuroblastoma SH- SY5Y cells: A role for S1P1/p38MAPK/ATF4 axis.",
    "abstract": "Besides its classical function of bone metabolism regulation, 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), acts on a variety of tissues including the nervous system, where the hormone plays an important role as neuroprotective, antiproliferating and differentiating agent. Sphingolipids are bioactive lipids that play critical and complex roles in regulating cell fate. In the present paper we have investigated whether sphingolipids are involved in the protective action of 1,25(OH)2D3. We have found that 1,25(OH)2D3 prevents amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta(1-42)) cytotoxicity both in differentiated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells and in vivo. In differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, Abeta(1-42) strongly reduces the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)/ceramide (Cer) ratio while 1,25(OH)2D3 partially reverts this effect. 1,25(OH)2D3 reverts also the Abeta(1-42)-induced reduction of sphingosine kinase activity. We have also studied the crosstalk between 1,25(OH)2D3 and S1P signaling pathways downstream to the activation of S1P receptor subtype S1P1. Notably, we found that 1,25(OH)2D3 prevents the reduction of S1P1 expression promoted by Abeta(1-42) and thereby it modulates the downstream signaling leading to ER stress damage (p38MAPK/ATF4). Similar effects were observed by using ZK191784. In addition, chronic treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 protects from aggregated Abeta(1-42)-induced damage in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus and promotes cell proliferation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of adult mice. In conclusion, these results represent the first evidence of the role of 1,25(OH)2D3 and its structural analogue ZK191784 in counteracting the Abeta(1-42) peptide-induced toxicity through the modulation of S1P/S1P1/p38MAPK/ATF4 pathway in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells.",

Characteristic for preeclampsia is the involvement of multiple proteins of which fragments of SERPINA1 and beta-amyloid co-aggregate in urine and placenta of preeclamptic women. To explore the biophysical basis of this interaction, we investigated the multidimensional efficacy of the FVFLM sequence in SERPINA1, as a model inhibitory agent of beta-amyloid aggregation. After studying the oligomerization of FVFLM peptides using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with the GROMOS43a1 force field and explicit water, we report that FVFLM can aggregate and its aggregation is spontaneous with a remarkably faster rate than that recorded for KLVFF (aggregation \"hot-spot\" from beta-amyloid). The fast kinetics of FVFLM aggregation was found to be driven primarily by core-like aromatic interactions originating from the anti-parallel orientation of complementarily uncharged strands. The conspicuously stable aggregation mechanism observed for FVFLM peptides is found not to conform to the popular 'dock-lock' scheme. We also found high propensity of FVFLM for KLVFF binding. When present, FVFLM disrupts the beta-amyloid aggregation pathway and we propose that FVFLM-like peptides might be used to prevent the assembly of full-length Abeta or other pro-amyloidogenic peptides into amyloid fibrils.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. There is no test for its definitive diagnosis in routine clinical practice. Although phase III clinical trials have failed, only symptomatic treatment is currently available; a possible reason for these failed trials is that intervention commenced at an advanced stage of the disease. The hallmarks of an AD brain include plaques comprising of extracellular beta-amyloid (Abeta) protein aggregates and intracellular hyperphosphorylated neurofibrillary tangles of tau. Research into the preclinical diagnosis of AD has provided considerable evidence regarding early neuropathological changes using brain Abeta imaging and the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, Abeta and tau. Both these approaches have limitations that are expensive, invasive or time consuming and thus preclude them from screening at-risk population. Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of Abeta plaques in the eyes of AD subjects, which is positively associated with their brain Abeta burden. Thus ocular biomarkers point to a potential avenue for an earlier, relatively low-cost diagnosis in order for therapeutic interventions to be effective. Here we review the literature that spans the investigation for the presence of Abeta in aging eyes and the significance of its deposition in relation to AD pathology. We discuss clinical studies investigating in vivo imaging of Abeta in the eye and its association with brain Abeta burden and therapies that target ocular Abeta. Finally, we focus on the need to characterize AD-specific retinal Abeta to differentiate Abeta found in some eye diseases. Based on the current evidence, we conclude that integration of ocular biomarkers that can correctly predict brain Abeta burden would have an important role as a non-invasive, yet economical surrogate marker in the diagnostic process of AD.",

    "title": "Zinc and Copper Differentially Modulate Amyloid Precursor Protein Processing by gamma-Secretase and Amyloid-beta Peptide Production.",
    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests involvement of biometal homeostasis in the pathological mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease (AD). For example, increased intracellular copper or zinc has been linked to a reduction in secreted levels of the AD-causing amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). However, little is known about whether these biometals modulate the generation of Abeta. In the present study we demonstrate in both cell-free and cell-based assays that zinc and copper regulate Abeta production by distinct molecular mechanisms affecting the processing by gamma-secretase of its Abeta precursor protein substrate APP-C99. We found that Zn2+ induces APP-C99 dimerization, which prevents its cleavage by gamma-secretase and Abeta production, with an IC50 value of 15 mum Importantly, at this concentration, Zn2+ also drastically raised the production of the aggregation-prone Abeta43 found in the senile plaques of AD brains and elevated the Abeta43:Abeta40 ratio, a promising biomarker for neurotoxicity and AD. We further demonstrate that the APP-C99 histidine residues His-6, His-13, and His-14 control the Zn2+-dependent APP-C99 dimerization and inhibition of Abeta production, whereas the increased Abeta43:Abeta40 ratio is substrate dimerization-independent and involves the known Zn2+ binding lysine Lys-28 residue that orientates the APP-C99 transmembrane domain within the lipid bilayer. Unlike zinc, copper inhibited Abeta production by directly targeting the subunits presenilin and nicastrin in the gamma-secretase complex. Altogether, our data demonstrate that zinc and copper differentially modulate Abeta production. They further suggest that dimerization of APP-C99 or the specific targeting of individual residues regulating the production of the long, toxic Abeta species, may offer two therapeutic strategies for preventing AD.",

    "abstract": "Low molecular weight oligomers of amyloid-beta (Abeta) have emerged as the primary toxic agents in the etiology of Alzheimer disease (AD). Polymorphism observed within the aggregation end products of fibrils are known to arise due to microstructural differences among the oligomers. Diversity in aggregate morphology correlates with the differences in AD, cementing the idea that conformational strains of oligomers could be significant in phenotypic outcomes. Therefore, it is imperative to determine the ability of strains to faithfully propagate their structure. Here we report fibril propagation of an Abeta42 dodecamer called large fatty acid-derived oligomers (LFAOs). The LFAO oligomeric strain selectively induces acute cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in neonatally-injected transgenic CRND8 mice. Propagation in-vitro occurs as a three-step process involving the association of LFAO units. LFAO-seeded fibrils possess distinct morphology made of repeating LFAO units that could be regenerated upon sonication. Overall, these data bring forth an important mechanistic perspective into strain-specific propagation of oligomers that has remained elusive thus far.",

    "abstract": "Reactive astrocytes are strongly induced by central nervous system (CNS) injury and disease, but their role is poorly understood. Here we show that a subtype of reactive astrocytes, which we termed A1, is induced by classically activated neuroinflammatory microglia. We show that activated microglia induce A1 astrocytes by secreting Il-1alpha, TNF and C1q, and that these cytokines together are necessary and sufficient to induce A1 astrocytes. A1 astrocytes lose the ability to promote neuronal survival, outgrowth, synaptogenesis and phagocytosis, and induce the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes. Death of axotomized CNS neurons in vivo is prevented when the formation of A1 astrocytes is blocked. Finally, we show that A1 astrocytes are abundant in various human neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. Taken together these findings help to explain why CNS neurons die after axotomy, strongly suggest that A1 astrocytes contribute to the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes in neurodegenerative disorders, and provide opportunities for the development of new treatments for these diseases.",

The ECM and cell surface partners of Abeta42 and its supramolecular forms were identified with protein and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) arrays (81 molecules in triplicate) probed by surface plasmon resonance imaging. The number of partners of Abeta42 increased upon its multimerization, ranging from 4 for the peptide up to 53 for the fibrillar aggregates. The peptide interacted only with ECM proteins but their percentage among Abeta42 partners decreased upon multimerization. Abeta42 and its supramolecular forms recognized different molecular features on their partners, and the partners of Abeta42 fibrillar forms were enriched in laminin IV-A, N-terminal, and EGF-like domains. Abeta42 oligomerization triggered interactions with receptors, whereas Abeta42 fibrillogenesis promoted binding to GAGs, proteoglycans, enzymes, and growth factors and the ability to interact with perineuronal nets. Fibril aggregation bind to further membrane proteins including tumor endothelial marker-8, syndecan-4, and discoidin-domain receptor-2. The partners of the Abeta42 supramolecular forms are enriched in proteins contributing to cell growth and/or maintenance, involved in integrin cell surface interactions and expressed in kidney cancer, preadipocytes, and dentin. In conclusion, the supramolecular assembly of Abeta42 governs its ability to interact in vitro with ECM proteins, remodeling and crosslinking ECM enzymes, proteoglycans, and receptors.",

    "abstract": "The presence of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque and tau protein hyperphosphorylation in brain tissue is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). At least some Abeta neurotoxicity is caused by the presence of excess glutamate that has been induced by Abeta accumulation. Memantine is currently the only NMDA receptor inhibitor approved for treating moderate-to-severe AD patients. We utilized primary cortical neurons and DiBAC4(3), a slow-response voltage sensitive fluorescence dye, to create a novel system for screening herbal medicines that allows the identification of pure compounds able to ameliorate Abeta-induced abnormal depolarization. The intensity of DiBAC4(3) fluorescence was increased when primary neurons were stimulated by Abeta; furthermore, pre-treatment with memantine abolished this change. Using this system, we identified six crude extracts made from herbal medicines that effectively alleviated this Abeta-induced abnormal depolarization. Among these herbal medicines, one pure compound, baicalein, which was known to be present in Scutellaria baricalensis and is known to improve memory using an AD mouse model, was identified by our assay. However, the compound's molecular mechanism remained unknown. We found that baicalein, in addition to inhibiting Abeta-induced depolarization, possibly functions as an antagonist of AMPA and NMDA receptors. Taken together, we have established a system/platform to identify herbal medicines that ameliorate Abeta-induced depolarization of neurons. Equally important, baicalein is a candidate drug with great potential for the treatment of AD patients.",

Here we show in a transgenic mouse model expressing mutant human tau predominantly in the EC that the formation of mature tangles in old mice was associated with excitatory cell loss and deficits in grid cell function, including destabilized grid fields and reduced firing rates, as well as altered network activity. Overt tau pathology in the aged mice was accompanied by spatial memory deficits. Therefore, tau pathology initiated in the entorhinal cortex could lead to deficits in grid cell firing and underlie the deterioration of spatial cognition seen in human AD.",

    "abstract": "Both amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposition and neuroinflammation are considered to be early events that play pivotal roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and its associated cognitive impairment. Prophylactic anti-Abeta active immunotherapy is a promising therapeutic strategy for AD, if the Abeta-specific autoimmune responses to self T cell epitopes of Abeta can be avoided. This can be achieved by the use of antigen, which contains the B cell epitope of Abeta and excludes the Abeta-specific T cell epitope. In this study, we developed a novel peptide epitope vaccine, Abeta3-10-KLH, by coupling the B cell epitope Abeta3-10 to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as the carrier protein, and subcutaneously injected it into 2.5-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Abeta3-10-KLH immunization induced high levels of anti-Abeta antibodies and significantly improved cognitive ability in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence revealed that Abeta3-10-KLH immunization significantly reduced cerebral amyloid plaque formation and alleviated gliosis. The results indicate that Abeta3-10-KLH immunization successfully rescued cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 transgenic mice via decreasing cerebral Abeta deposition and neuroinflammation. Abeta3-10-KLH may potentially be safe and effective for prevention and treatment of AD.",

    "title": "Innate Immunity Stimulation via Toll-Like Receptor 9 Ameliorates Vascular Amyloid Pathology in Tg-SwDI Mice with Associated Cognitive Benefits.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of parenchymal amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and neurofibrillary tangles. Currently there are no effective treatments for AD. Immunotherapeutic approaches under development are hampered by complications related to ineffectual clearance of CAA. Genome-wide association studies have demonstrated the importance of microglia in AD pathogenesis. Microglia are the primary innate immune cells of the brain. Depending on their activation state and environment, microglia can be beneficial or detrimental. In our prior work, we showed that stimulation of innate immunity with Toll-like receptor 9 agonist, class B CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), can reduce amyloid and tau pathologies without causing toxicity in Tg2576 and 3xTg-AD mouse models. However, these transgenic mice have relatively little CAA. In the current study, we evaluated the therapeutic profile of CpG ODN in a triple transgenic mouse model, Tg-SwDI, with abundant vascular amyloid, in association with low levels of parenchymal amyloid deposits. Peripheral administration of CpG ODN, both before and after the development of CAA, negated short-term memory deficits, as assessed by object-recognition tests, and was effective at improving spatial and working memory evaluated using a radial arm maze. These findings were associated with significant reductions of CAA pathology lacking adverse effects. Together, our extensive evidence suggests that this innovative immunomodulation may be a safe approach to ameliorate all hallmarks of AD pathology, supporting the potential clinical applicability of CpG ODN. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Recent genetic studies have underscored the emerging role of microglia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Microglia lose their amyloid-beta-clearing capabilities with age and as AD progresses. Therefore, the ability to modulate microglia profiles offers a promising therapeutic avenue for reducing AD pathology. Current immunotherapeutic approaches have been limited by poor clearance of a core AD lesion, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The present study used Tg-SwDI mice, which have extensive CAA. We found that stimulation of the innate immune system and microglia/macrophage activation via Toll-like receptor 9 using CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) leads to cognitive improvements and CAA reduction, without associated toxicity. Our data indicate that this novel concept of immunomodulation represents a safer method to reduce all aspects of AD pathology and provide essential information for potential clinical use of CpG ODN.",

    "abstract": "Proteins in the proximity of inorganic surfaces and nanoparticles may undergo profound adjustments that trigger biomedically relevant processes, such as protein fibrillation. The mechanisms that govern protein-surface interactions at the molecular level are still poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the adsorption onto a gold surface, in water, of an amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, which is the amyloidogenic peptide involved in Alzheimer's disease. The entire adsorption process, from the peptide in bulk water to its conformational relaxation on the surface, is explored by large-scale atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We start by providing a description of the conformational ensemble of Abeta in solution by a 22 mus temperature replica exchange MD simulation, which is consistent with previous results. Then, we obtain a statistical description of how the peptide approaches the gold surface by multiple MD simulations, identifying the preferential gold-binding sites and giving a kinetic picture of the association process. Finally, relaxation of the Abeta conformations at the gold/water interface is performed by a 19 mus Hamiltonian-temperature replica exchange MD simulation. We find that the conformational ensemble of Abeta is strongly perturbed by the presence of the surface. In particular, at the gold/water interface the population of the conformers akin to amyloid fibrils is significantly enriched, suggesting that this extended contact geometry may promote fibrillation.",

    "abstract": "Fingolimod, also known as FTY720, is an analogue of the sphingolipid sphingosine, which has been proved to be neuroprotective in rodent models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several cellular and molecular targets underlying the neuroprotective effects of FTY720 have been recently identified. However, whether the drug directly protects neurons from toxicity of amyloid-beta (Abeta) still remains poorly defined. Using a combination of biochemical assays, live imaging and electrophysiology we demonstrate that FTY720 induces a rapid increase in GLUN2A-containing neuroprotective NMDARs on the surface of dendritic spines in cultured hippocampal neurons. In addition, the drug mobilizes extrasynaptic GLUN2B-containing NMDARs, which are coupled to cell death, to the synapses. Altered ratio of synaptic/extrasynaptic NMDARs decreases calcium responsiveness of neurons to neurotoxic soluble Abeta 1-42 and renders neurons resistant to early alteration of calcium homeostasis. The fast defensive response of FTY720 occurs through a Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1P-R) -dependent mechanism, as it is lost in the presence of S1P-R1 and S1P-R3 antagonists. We propose that rapid synaptic relocation of NMDARs might have direct impact on amelioration of cognitive performance in transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mice upon sub-chronic treatment with FTY720.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive reserve (CR) prevents cognitive decline and delays neurodegeneration. Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that lifelong bilingualism may act as CR delaying the onset of dementia by ~4.5 y. Much controversy surrounds the issue of bilingualism and its putative neuroprotective effects. We studied brain metabolism, a direct index of synaptic function and density, and neural connectivity to shed light on the effects of bilingualism in vivo in Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Eighty-five patients with probable AD and matched for disease duration (45 German-Italian bilingual speakers and 40 monolingual speakers) were included. Notably, bilingual individuals were on average 5 y older than their monolingual peers. In agreement with our predictions and with models of CR, cerebral hypometabolism was more severe in the group of bilingual individuals with AD. The metabolic connectivity analyses crucially supported the neuroprotective effect of bilingualism by showing an increased connectivity in the executive control and the default mode networks in the bilingual, compared with the monolingual, AD patients. Furthermore, the degree of lifelong bilingualism (i.e., high, moderate, or low use) was significantly correlated to functional modulations in crucial neural networks, suggesting both neural reserve and compensatory mechanisms. These findings indicate that lifelong bilingualism acts as a powerful CR proxy in dementia and exerts neuroprotective effects against neurodegeneration. Delaying the onset of dementia is a top priority of modern societies, and the present in vivo neurobiological evidence should stimulate social programs and interventions to support bilingual or multilingual education and the maintenance of the second language among senior citizens.",

    "title": "Aging and amyloid beta oligomers enhance TLR4 expression, LPS-induced Ca2+ responses, and neuron cell death in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are transmembrane pattern-recognition receptors of the innate immune system recognizing diverse pathogen-derived and tissue damage-related ligands. It has been suggested that TLR signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of age-related, neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is associated to oligomers of the amyloid beta peptide (Abetao) that cause intracellular Ca2+ dishomeostasis and neuron cell death in rat hippocampal neurons. Here we assessed the interplay between inflammation and Abetao in long-term cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, an in vitro model of neuron aging and/or senescence. METHODS: Ca2+ imaging and immunofluorescence against annexin V and TLR4 were applied in short- and long-term cultures of rat hippocampal neurons to test the effects of TLR4-agonist LPS and Abetao on cytosolic [Ca2+] and on apoptosis as well as on expression of TLR4. RESULTS: LPS increases cytosolic [Ca2+] and promotes apoptosis in rat hippocampal neurons in long-term culture considered aged and/or senescent neurons, but not in short-term cultured neurons considered young neurons. TLR4 antagonist CAY10614 prevents both effects. TLR4 expression in rat hippocampal neurons is significantly larger in aged hippocampal cultures. Treatment of aged hippocampal cultures with Abetao increases TLR4 expression and enhances LPS-induced Ca2+ responses and neuron cell death. CONCLUSIONS: Aging and amyloid beta oligomers, the neurotoxin involved in Alzheimer's disease, enhance TLR4 expression as well as LPS-induced Ca2+ responses and neuron cell death in rat hippocampal neurons aged in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Background: Changes in beta-amyloids (Abeta) and tau proteins have been noted in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and patients with both Down syndrome (DS) and AD. However, reports of changes in the early stage of regression, such as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), in DS are sparse. Methods: Seventy-eight controls, 62 patients with AD, 35 with DS and 16 with DS with degeneration (DS_D), including 9 with BPSD and 7 with dementia, were enrolled. The levels of beta-amyloids 40 and 42 (Abeta-40, Abeta-42) and tau protein in the blood were analyzed using immunomagnetic reduction (IMR). The Adaptive Behavior Dementia Questionnaire (ABDQ) was used to evaluate the clinical status of the degeneration. Results: The Abeta-40 and tau levels were higher and the Abeta-42 level and Abeta-42/Abeta-40 ratio were lower in DS than in the controls (all p < 0.001). Decreased Abeta-40 and increased Abeta-42 levels and Abeta-42/40 ratios were observed in DS_D compared with DS without degeneration (all p < 0.001). The ABDQ score was negatively correlated with the Abeta-40 level (rho = -0.556) and the tau protein level (rho = -0.410) and positively associated with the Abeta-42 level (rho = 0.621) and the Abeta-42/40 ratio (rho = 0.544; all p < 0.05). Conclusions: The Abeta-40 and Abeta-42 levels and the Abeta-42/Abeta-40 ratio are considered possible biomarkers for the early detection of degeneration in DS. The elevated Abeta-40 and tau levels in DS may indicate early neurodegeneration. The increased Abeta-42 in DS_D may reflect the neurotoxicity of Abeta-42. The paradox of the tau decreases in DS_D could be explained by a burnout phenomenon during long-term neurodegeneration. The different patterns of the plasma beta amyloids and tau protein may imply a different pathogenesis between DS with degeneration and AD in the general population, in spite of their common key pathological features.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder linked to protein aggregation, like more than twenty other human pathologies. One major protein incriminated in AD is the 42-residue amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta1-42) which aggregates to form neurotoxic oligomers and fibrils. While, low molecular weight oligomers have been evidenced as neurotoxic species, only scarce methods raise the challenge to monitor the beginning of the aggregation process, called oligomerization. We propose here an innovative and fast monitoring of the time-dependent Abeta1-42 oligomerization pattern by electrospray differential mobility analysis (ES-DMA). We developed a non-denaturing method based on ES-DMA to afford a real-time and direct characterization of the early, metastable and neurotoxic species. This technique provided their size distribution over time. At the beginning of the in vitro oligomerization process of Abeta1-42, the size distribution is characterized by two populations with modal diameters around 3.5 and 4nm, corresponding to Monomer and Small oligomers. After few hours, larger species around 10nm are observed. The results were correlated to those obtained by capillary electrophoresis. We also demonstrated the ability of our method to evaluate Abeta1-42 kinetics modulators. Thereby, ES-DMA provides new insights on Abeta1-42 oligomerization in the presence of sugar-based peptidomimetic analogs which were recently described as modulators of Abeta1-42 self-assembly and neurotoxicity inhibitors.",

However, the early events in the onset of the pathology are yet to be fully elucidated. A cell model system in which LAN5 neuroblastoma cells were incubated for a short time with a recombinant form of Abeta42 was utilized. Proteins extracted from these cells were subjected to shotgun proteomics analysis by LTQ-Orbitrap-MS followed by label-free quantitation. By bioinformatics tools we found that the most significant of those found to be up-regulated were related to cytoskeletal dynamics (Rho related) and membrane-related processes. The most significant of the down-regulated proteins were hnRNP-related. In particular, hnRNPs involved in ribosomal biogenesis and in splicing were down-regulated. The latter of these processes stood out as it was highlighted ubiquitously and with the highest significance in the results of every analysis. Furthermore, our findings revealed down-regulation at every stage of the splicing process through down-regulation of every subunit of the spliceosome. Dysregulation of the spliceosome was also confirmed using a Western blot. In conclusion, these data suggest dysregulation of the proteins and processes identified as early events in pathogenesis of AD following Abeta accumulation.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides play a key role in synaptic damage and memory deficits in the early pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abnormal accumulation of Abeta at nerve terminals leads to synaptic pathology and ultimately to neurodegeneration. beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the major neuronal beta-secretase for Abeta generation. However, the mechanisms regulating BACE1 distribution in axons and beta cleavage of APP at synapses remain largely unknown. Here, we reveal that dynein-Snapin-mediated retrograde transport regulates BACE1 trafficking in axons and APP processing at presynaptic terminals. BACE1 is predominantly accumulated within late endosomes at the synapses of AD-related mutant human APP (hAPP) transgenic (Tg) mice and patient brains. Defective retrograde transport by genetic ablation of snapin in mice recapitulates late endocytic retention of BACE1 and increased APP processing at presynaptic sites. Conversely, overexpressing Snapin facilitates BACE1 trafficking and reduces synaptic BACE1 accumulation by enhancing the removal of BACE1 from distal AD axons and presynaptic terminals. Moreover, elevated Snapin expression via stereotactic hippocampal injections of adeno-associated virus particles in mutant hAPP Tg mouse brains decreases synaptic Abeta levels and ameliorates synapse loss, thus rescuing cognitive impairments associated with hAPP mice. Altogether, our study provides new mechanistic insights into the complex regulation of BACE1 trafficking and presynaptic localization through Snapin-mediated dynein-driven retrograde axonal transport, thereby suggesting a potential approach of modulating Abeta levels and attenuating synaptic deficits in AD.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT beta-Site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) trafficking and synaptic localization significantly influence its beta secretase activity and amyloid-beta (Abeta) production. In AD brains, BACE1 is accumulated within dystrophic neurites, which is thought to augment Abeta-induced synaptotoxicity by Abeta overproduction. However, it remains largely unknown whether axonal transport regulates synaptic APP processing. Here, we demonstrate that Snapin-mediated retrograde transport plays a critical role in removing BACE1 from presynaptic terminals toward the soma, thus reducing synaptic Abeta production. Adeno-associated virus-mediated Snapin overexpression in the hippocampus of mutant hAPP mice significantly decreases synaptic Abeta levels, attenuates synapse loss, and thus rescues cognitive deficits. Our study uncovers a new pathway that controls synaptic APP processing by enhancing axonal BACE1 trafficking, thereby advancing our fundamental knowledge critical for ameliorating Abeta-linked synaptic pathology.",

    "abstract": "An large body of evidence indicates that leptin has protective role against Alzheimer's disease, where it reduces beta-amyloid (Abeta) production in both cell culture and animal models. Our previous studies revealed that geniposide could attenuate the production of Abeta1-42 and antagonize the neurotoxicity of Abeta1-42 in neurons. However, the mechanism that underlies these effects remains to be clarified. To investigate whether leptin signaling is involved in regulating the production of Abeta1-42 by geniposide, we treated primary neurons with leptin antagonist (LA), and determined the influence of LA on the activities of leptin signaling molecules and the expressions of secretases associated with the production of Abeta1-42. The finding showed that, accompanied with the inhibition on the level of Abeta1-42 in primary neurons and APP/PS1 transgenic mice, geniposide induced the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3, regulated the expression level of alpha- and beta-secretase, and all of these could be prevented by the pre-incubation with LA. The results of this study suggest that geniposide may regulate the production of Abeta1-42 via leptin signaling.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by loss of intellectual functioning of brain and memory loss. According to amyloid cascade hypothesis, aggregation of amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42) peptide can generate toxic oligomers and their accumulation in the brain is responsible for the onset of AD. In spite of carrying out a large number of experimental studies on inhibition of Abeta42 aggregation by small molecules, the detailed inhibitory mechanism remains elusive. In the present study, comparable molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of a sulfonamide inhibitor C1 (2,5-dichloro-N-(4-piperidinophenyl)-3-thiophenesulfonamide), reported for its in vitro and in vivo anti-aggregation activity against Abeta42. MD simulations reveal that C1 stabilizes native alpha-helix conformation of Abeta42 by interacting with key residues in the central helix region (13-26) with hydrogen bonds and pi-pi interactions. C1 lowers the solvent-accessible surface area of the central hydrophobic core (CHC), KLVFF (16-20), that confirms burial of hydrophobic residues leading to the dominance of helical conformation in the CHC region. The binding free energy analysis with MM-PBSA demonstrates that Ala2, Phe4, Tyr10, Gln15, Lys16, Leu17, Val18, Phe19, Phe20, Glu22, and Met35 contribute maximum to binding free energy (-43.1 kcal/mol) between C1 and Abeta42 monomer. Overall, MD simulations reveal that C1 inhibits Abeta42 aggregation by stabilizing native helical conformation and inhibiting the formation of aggregation-prone beta-sheet conformation. The present results will shed light on the underlying inhibitory mechanism of small molecules that show potential in vitro anti-aggregation activity against Abeta42.",

    "abstract": "beta-2-Microglobulin (beta2m) forms amyloid fibrils in the joints of patients undergoing dialysis treatment as a result of kidney failure. One of the ways in which beta2m can be induced to form amyloid fibrils in vitro is via incubation with stoichiometric amounts of Cu(II). To better understand the structural changes caused by Cu(II) binding that allow beta2m to form amyloid fibrils, we compared the effect of Ni(II) and Zn(II) binding, which are two similarly sized divalent metal ions that do not induce beta2m amyloid formation. Using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX/MS) and covalent labeling MS, we find that Ni(II) has little effect on beta2m structure, despite binding in the same region of the protein as Cu(II). This observation indicates that subtle differences in the organization of residues around Cu(II) cause distant changes that are necessary for oligomerization and eventual amyloid formation. One key difference that we find is that only Cu(II), not Ni(II) or Zn(II), is able to cause the cis-trans isomerization of Pro32 that is an important conformational switch that initiates beta2m amyloid formation. By comparing HDX/MS data from the three metal-beta2m complexes, we also discover that increased dynamics in the beta-sheet formed by the A, B, D, and E beta strands of the protein and repositioning of residues in the D-E loop are necessary aspects of beta2m forming an amyloid-competent dimer. Altogether, our results reveal new structural insights into the unique effect of Cu(II) in the metal-induced amyloid formation of beta2m.",

    "abstract": "To elucidate whether a permanent reduction of the GluN2B subunit affects the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we cross-bred mice heterozygous for GluN2B receptors in the forebrain (hetGluN2B) with a mouse model for AD carrying a mutated amyloid precursor protein with the Swedish and Arctic mutation (mAPP) resulting in a hetGluN2B/mAPP transgenic. By means of voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) in the di-synaptic hippocampal pathway and the recording of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), hippocampal slices of all genotypes (WT, hetGluN2B, mAPP and hetGluN2B/mAPP, age 9-18 months) were tested for spatiotemporal activity propagation and long-term potentiation (LTP) induction. CA1-LTP induced by high frequency stimulation (HFS; 100 Hz/1s) was not different in all genotypes. Abeta1-42 (50 nM)-application reduced potentiation of fEPSP in WT and hetGluN2B/mAPP mice, LTP in mAPP and hetGluN2B mice was not affected. For VSDI a fast depolarization signal was evoked in the granule cell layer and propagation was analysed in hippocampal CA3 and CA1 region before and after theta stimulation (100pulses/5 Hz). LTP was not significantly different between all genotypes. In mAPP mice theta-stim produced an epileptiform activity reflected in a pronounced prolongation of the FDS compared to the other genotypes. In slices of hetGluN2B/mAPP and GluN2B mice, however, these parameters were similar to WT mice indicating a reversal effect of the attenuated GluN2B expression. The induction of a hetGluN2B mutation in the mAPP reversed some pathophysiological changes on hippocampal LTP and provide further evidence for the involvement of the glutamatergic system in AD and emphasize the GluN2B subunit as a potential target for AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are long and unbranched polysaccharides that are abundant in the extracellular matrix and basement membrane of multicellular organisms. These linear polyanionic macromolecules are involved in many physiological functions from cell adhesion to cellular signaling. Interestingly, amyloid fibrils extracted from patients afflicted with protein misfolding diseases are virtually always associated with GAGs. Amyloid fibrils are highly organized nanostructures that have been historically associated with pathological states, such as Alzheimer's disease and systemic amyloidoses. However, recent studies have identified functional amyloids that accomplish crucial physiological roles in almost all living organisms, from bacteria to insects and mammals. Over the last 2 decades, numerous reports have revealed that sulfated GAGs accelerate and (or) promote the self-assembly of a large diversity of proteins, both inherently amyloidogenic and non-aggregation prone. Despite the fact that many studies have investigated the molecular mechanism(s) by which GAGs induce amyloid assembly, the mechanistic elucidation of GAG-mediated amyloidogenesis still remains the subject of active research. In this review, we expose the contribution of GAGs in amyloid assembly, and we discuss the pathophysiological and functional significance of GAG-mediated fibrillization. Finally, we propose mechanistic models of the unique and potent ability of sulfated GAGs to hasten amyloid fibril formation.",

    "abstract": "People with Down syndrome (DS) have a neurodevelopmentally distinct brain and invariably developed amyloid neuropathology by age 50. This cross-sectional study aimed to provide a detailed account of DS brain morphology and the changes occuring with amyloid neuropathology. Forty-six adults with DS underwent structural and amyloid imaging-the latter using Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) to stratify the cohort into PIB-positive (n = 19) and PIB-negative (n = 27). Age-matched controls (n = 30) underwent structural imaging. Group differences in deep gray matter volumetry and cortical thickness were studied. PIB-negative people with DS have neurodevelopmentally atypical brain, characterized by disproportionately thicker frontal and occipitoparietal cortex and thinner motor cortex and temporal pole with larger putamina and smaller hippocampi than controls. In the presence of amyloid neuropathology, the DS brains demonstrated a strikingly similar pattern of posterior dominant cortical thinning and subcortical atrophy in the hippocampus, thalamus, and striatum, to that observed in non-DS Alzheimer's disease. Care must be taken to avoid underestimating amyloid-associated morphologic changes in DS due to disproportionate size of some subcortical structures and thickness of the cortex.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of neurodegenerative-disease associated proteins can be affected by many factors, including a variety of post-translational modifications. One such modification, O-GlcNAcylation, has been found on some of these aggregation prone proteins, including alpha-synuclein, the major protein that plays a causative role in synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease. We previously used synthetic protein chemistry to prepare alpha-synuclein bearing a homogeneous O-GlcNAc modification at threonine 72 and showed that this modification inhibits protein aggregation. However, the effects of the other eight O-GlcNAcylation sites that have been identified were unknown. Here, we use a similar synthetic strategy to investigate the consequences of this modification at one of these sites, serine 87. We show that O-GlcNAcylation at this site also inhibits alpha-synuclein aggregation but to a lesser extent than that for the same modification at threonine 72. However, we also find that this modification does not affect the membrane-binding properties of alpha-synuclein, which differentiates it from phosphorylation at the same site. These results further support the development of therapies that can elevate O-GlcNAcylation of alpha-synuclein to slow the progression of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic dysfunction and loss is the strongest pathological correlate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with increasing evidence implicating neuropathological tau protein in this process. Despite the knowledge that tau spreads through defined synaptic circuits, it is currently unknown whether synapse loss occurs before the accumulation of tau or as a consequence. To address this, we have used array tomography to examine an rTgTauEC mouse model expressing a P301L human tau transgene and a transgene labeling cytoplasm red (tdTomato) and presynaptic terminals green (Synaptophysin-EGFP). All transgenes are restricted primarily to the entorhinal cortex using the neuropsin promotor to drive tTA expression. It has previously been shown that rTgTauEC mice exhibit neuronal loss in the entorhinal cortex and synapse density loss in the middle molecular layer (MML) of the dentate gyrus at 24 months of age. Here, we observed the density of tau-expressing and total presynapses, and the spread of tau into the postsynapse in the MML of 3-6, 9, and 18 month old red-green-rTgTauEC mice. We observe no loss of synapse density in the MML up to 18 months even in axons expressing tau. Despite the maintenance of synapse density, we see spread of human tau from presynaptic terminals to postsynaptic compartments in the MML at very early ages, indicating that the spread of tau through neural circuits is not due to the degeneration of axon terminals and is an early feature of the disease process.",

    "abstract": "Deficiency in cerebral amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) clearance is implicated in the pathogenesis of the common late-onset forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accumulation of misfolded Abeta in the brain is believed to be a net result of imbalance between its production and removal. This in turn may trigger neuroinflammation, progressive synaptic loss, and ultimately cognitive decline. Clearance of cerebral Abeta is a complex process mediated by various systems and cell types, including vascular transport across the blood-brain barrier, glymphatic drainage, and engulfment and degradation by resident microglia and infiltrating innate immune cells. Recent studies have highlighted a new, unexpected role for peripheral monocytes and macrophages in restricting cerebral Abeta fibrils, and possibly soluble oligomers. In AD transgenic (ADtg) mice, monocyte ablation or inhibition of their migration into the brain exacerbated Abeta pathology, while blood enrichment with monocytes and their increased recruitment to plaque lesion sites greatly diminished Abeta burden. Profound neuroprotective effects in ADtg mice were further achieved through increased cerebral recruitment of myelomonocytes overexpressing Abeta-degrading enzymes. This review summarizes the literature on cellular and molecular mechanisms of cerebral Abeta clearance with an emphasis on the role of peripheral monocytes and macrophages in Abeta removal.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by excessive production and deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) proteins as well as synapse dysfunction and loss. While soluble Abeta oligomers (AbetaOs) have deleterious effects on synapse function and reduce synapse number, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Here we screened synaptic organizer proteins for cell-surface interaction with AbetaOs and identified a novel interaction between neurexins (NRXs) and AbetaOs. AbetaOs bind to NRXs via the N-terminal histidine-rich domain (HRD) of beta-NRX1/2/3 and alternatively-spliced inserts at splicing site 4 of NRX1/2. In artificial synapse-formation assays, AbetaOs diminish excitatory presynaptic differentiation induced by NRX-interacting proteins including neuroligin1/2 (NLG1/2) and the leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein LRRTM2. Although AbetaOs do not interfere with the binding of NRX1beta to NLG1 or LRRTM2, time-lapse imaging revealed that AbetaO treatment reduces surface expression of NRX1beta on axons and that this reduction depends on the NRX1beta HRD. In transgenic mice expressing mutated human amyloid precursor protein, synaptic expression of beta-NRXs, but not alpha-NRXs, decreases. Thus our data indicate that AbetaOs interact with NRXs and that this interaction inhibits NRX-mediated presynaptic differentiation by reducing surface expression of axonal beta-NRXs, providing molecular and mechanistic insights into how AbetaOs lead to synaptic pathology in AD.",

METHODS: Using data from the National Institute on Aging Genetics Initiative for Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease (National Institute on Aging-Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study), mixed regression models tested the association of familial LOAD with a GRS based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with LOAD. We modeled associations using unweighted and weighted scores with estimates derived from the literature. In secondary models, we adjusted subsequent models for presence of the APOE epsilon4 allele and further tested the interaction between APOE epsilon4 and the GRS. We constructed a similar GRS in a cohort of Caribbean Hispanic families multiply affected by LOAD by selecting the SNP with the strongest p value within the same regions. RESULTS: In the NIA-LOAD families, the GRS was significantly associated with LOAD (odds ratio [OR] 1.29; 95% confidence interval 1.21-1.37). The results did not change after adjusting for APOE epsilon4. In Caribbean Hispanic families, the GRS also significantly predicted LOAD (OR 1.73; 1.57-1.93). Higher scores were associated with lower age at onset in both cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: High GRS increases the risk of familial LOAD and lowers the age at onset, regardless of ethnic group.",

    "abstract": "In addition to coupling cell metabolism and excitability, ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) are involved in neural function and plasticity. Moreover, alterations in KATP activity and expression have been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and during amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced pathology. Thus, we tested whether KATP modulators can influence Abeta-induced deleterious effects on memory, hippocampal network function, and plasticity. We found that treating animals with subclinical doses (those that did not change glycemia) of a KATP blocker (Tolbutamide) or a KATP opener (Diazoxide) differentially restrained Abeta-induced memory deficit, hippocampal network activity inhibition, and long-term synaptic plasticity unbalance (i.e., inhibition of LTP and promotion of LTD). We found that the protective effect of Tolbutamide against Abeta-induced memory deficit was strong and correlated with the reestablishment of synaptic plasticity balance, whereas Diazoxide treatment produced a mild protection against Abeta-induced memory deficit, which was not related to a complete reestablishment of synaptic plasticity balance. Interestingly, treatment with both KATP modulators renders the hippocampus resistant to Abeta-induced inhibition of hippocampal network activity.

    "title": "Synaptic Compensation as a Probable Cause of Prolonged Mild Cognitive Impairment in Alzheimer's Disease: Implications from a Transgenic Mouse Model of the Disease.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slow, progressive neurodegenerative disease in which cognitive decline takes place over a period of several years with a very variable period of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and, in some cases, relatively long period before progression to dementia. The cognitive deficit during MCI is probably due to neuronal loss, an intermediate level of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and synaptosis, which is interrupted with a transient compensatory increase. We found impairment in reference memory accompanied by a decrease in the expression of synaptophysin, beta-III tubulin, and MAP2 and a trend for GluR1, at 12 weeks of age in 3xTg-AD mice (hAPPSwe, P301L tau, PS1 [M146V] knock-in), a widely used transgenic model of AD. Past 12 weeks, the cross-sectional analysis of different age groups showed a compensatory increase in synaptic markers relative to that in wild type animals in a topographic and time-dependent manner. When studied across time we found that in 3xTg-AD mice, the compensatory phenomenon occurred in parallel in different regions of the brain. However, this attempt of the brain to repair itself was able to only partially rescue cognitive impairment. These findings for the first time raise the intriguing possibility that AD causing mutated transgenes may initially cause an increase in synaptic and dendritic markers as a compensatory mechanism for synaptic deficit, and this phenomenon, though transient, could be the biological basis of the period of MCI seen in AD.",

    "abstract": "Secreted soluble amyloid-beta 1-37 (Abeta37) peptide is one of the prominent Abeta forms next to Abeta40, and is found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. Recent studies have shown the importance of quantitation of CSF Abeta37 levels in combination with Abeta38, Abeta40, and Abeta42 to support the diagnosis of patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the value of antibody to Abeta37 to facilitate drug discovery studies. However, the availability of reliable and specific monoclonal antibody to Abeta37 is very limited. Our aims were: 1) to generate and partially characterize rabbit monoclonal antibody (RabmAb) to Abeta37, and 2) to determine whether the antibody detects changes in Abeta37 levels produced by a gamma-secretase modulator (GSM). Our generated RabmAb to Abeta37 was found to be specific to Abeta37, since it did not react with Abeta36, Abeta38, Abeta39, Abeta40, and Abeta42 in an ELISA or immunoblotting. The epitope of the antibody was contained in the seven C-terminal residues of Abeta37. The antibody was sensitive enough to measure CSF and plasma Abeta37 levels in ELISA. Immunohistological studies showed the presence of Abeta37-positive deposits in the brain of AD, and Down syndrome persons diagnosed with AD. Our studies also showed that the antibody detected Abeta37 increases in CSF and brains of rodents following treatment with a GSM. Thus, our antibody can be widely applied to AD research, and in a panel based approach it may have potential to support the diagnosis of probable AD, and in testing the effect of GSMs to target AD.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical and neuropathological outcomes following a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Data were drawn from a large autopsy series (N = 1,337) of individuals followed longitudinally from normal or MCI status to death, derived from 4 Alzheimer Disease (AD) Centers in the United States. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 7.9 years. Of the 874 individuals ever diagnosed with MCI, final clinical diagnoses were varied: 39.2% died with an MCI diagnosis, 46.8% with a dementia diagnosis, and 13.9% with a diagnosis of intact cognition. The latter group had pathological features resembling those with a final clinical diagnosis of MCI. In terms of non-AD pathologies, both primary age-related tauopathy (p < 0.05) and brain arteriolosclerosis pathology (p < 0.001) were more severe in MCI than cognitively intact controls. Among the group that remained MCI until death, mixed AD neuropathologic changes (ADNC; >=1 comorbid pathology) were more frequent than \"pure\" ADNC pathology (55% vs 22%); suspected non-Alzheimer pathology comprised the remaining 22% of cases. A majority (74%) of subjects who died with MCI were without \"high\"-level ADNC, Lewy body disease, or hippocampal sclerosis pathologies; this group was enriched in cerebrovascular pathologies. Subjects who died with dementia and were without severe neurodegenerative pathologies tended to have cerebrovascular pathology and carry the MCI diagnosis for a longer interval. INTERPRETATION: MCI diagnosis usually was associated with comorbid neuropathologies; less than one-quarter of MCI cases showed \"pure\" AD at autopsy. Ann Neurol 2017;81:549-559.",

Antibodies towards soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) contained in IVIg were considered to be the major component contributing to the beneficial effect of the preparations in pilot studies. This study compared the antibody concentrations against Abeta in Octagam  IVIg (Octapharma) and 9 IVIg preparations from different Chinese manufacturers by ELISA, using Abeta40 monomer, Abeta40 soluble oligomers, Abeta42 monomer and Abeta42 soluble oligomers as the antigens. The results showed that each preparation contained different antibody levels against the four Abeta forms. The median values of the four antibody concentrations in Chinese IVIg preparations were 16.53, 8.47, 24.36 and 33.25mug/mL, which were remarkably higher than that in Octagam  IVIg (1.66, 2.07, 4.61 and 4.64mug/mL). Moreover, the anti-Abeta42 oligomer antibody levels in almost all IVIg preparations were higher than the anti-Abeta42 monomer antibody, and the concentrations of anti-Abeta42 antibodies in most of the IVIg preparations were significantly higher than that of anti-Abeta40 antibodies. These findings will contribute to an increased understanding of the uniqueness of Chinese IVIg preparations, and could provide support for a trial of a Chinese IVIg product in AD patients.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder among the elderly. Because the existing treatments for Alzheimer's disease only offer limited symptomatic alleviation, more efficient therapeutic agents are urgently needed. Date seed is a hepatoprotective and neuroprotective agent. Date seed extract (DSE) has bioactive components like phenolics, flavonoids, and vitamins. In view of the ameliorative effects of DSE against an oxidative injury, the current study was designed to reveal whether DSE has a neuroprotective resource in the rat model of Alzheimer's disease. In the current study, 24 adult male Sprague-Dawely rats were divided into three groups (n=8) of: Sham (Distilled Water, 3mul intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection), beta-Amyloid (beta-amyloid, 3mul ICV injection), and DSE-treated groups (80mg/kg, Intraperitoneal (IP) injection), for 12days. Twelve days after Alzheimer induction, behavioral analysis, the Morris Water Maze (MWM), as well as western blot and histological studies were performed to reveal the neuroprotective potential of DSE in rats. Administration of DSE significantly restored memory and learning impairments induced by Abeta in the MWM test. DSE significantly decreased the caspase-3 expression level in the treated group. In addition, DSE reduced the number of degenerated neurons in the hippocampal CA1 subfield of the DSE treated rats. These results demonstrate that DSE may have beneficial effects in the prevention of Abeta-induced Alzheimer in a rat model. Date seed extract may have advantageous effects in preventing Alzheimer's disease in male rats.",

We examined local (same region) and non-local (different region) associations between these 2 aggregated proteins in 46 normal older adults using [18F]AV-1451 (for tau) and [11C]PiB (for Abeta) positron emission tomography (PET) and 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. While local voxelwise analyses showed associations between PiB and AV-1451 tracer largely in the temporal lobes, k-means clustering revealed that some of these associations were driven by regions with low tracer retention. We followed this up with a whole-brain region-by-region (local and non-local) partial correlational analysis. We calculated each participant's mean AV-1451 and PiB uptake values within 87 regions of interest (ROI). Pairwise ROI analysis demonstrated many positive PiB-AV-1451 associations. Importantly, strong positive partial correlations (controlling for age, sex, and global gray matter fraction, p<.01) were identified between PiB in multiple regions of association cortex and AV-1451 in temporal cortical ROIs. There were also less frequent and weaker positive associations of regional PiB with frontoparietal AV-1451 uptake. Particularly in temporal lobe ROIs, AV-1451 uptake was strongly predicted by PiB across multiple ROI locations. These data indicate that Abeta and tau pathology show significant local and non-local regional associations among cognitively normal elderly, with increased PiB uptake throughout the cortex correlating with increased temporal lobe AV-1451 uptake. The spatial relationship between Abeta and tau accumulation does not appear to be specific to Abeta location, suggesting a regional vulnerability of temporal brain regions to tau accumulation regardless of where Abeta accumulates.",

Methods: In vitro binding characteristics were determined for Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration patient brain tissue slices using autoradiography studies. Ex vivo biodistribution studies were performed in mice. Radiometabolites were quantified in the brain and plasma of mice and in the plasma of a rhesus monkey using high-performance liquid chromatography. Dynamic small-animal PET studies were performed in rats and a rhesus monkey to evaluate tracer pharmacokinetics in the brain. Results: Mouse biodistribution studies showed moderate initial brain uptake and rapid brain washout. Radiometabolite analyses after injection of 18F-JNJ64349311 in mice showed the presence of a polar radiometabolite in plasma, but not in the brain. Semiquantitative autoradiography studies on postmortem tissue sections of human Alzheimer's disease brains showed highly displaceable binding to tau-rich regions. No specific binding was, however, found on human progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration brain slices. Small-animal PET scans of Wistar rats revealed moderate initial brain uptake (SUV, ~1.5 at 1 min after injection) and rapid brain washout. Gradual bone uptake was, however, also observed. Blocking and displacement did not affect brain time-activity curves, suggesting no off-target specific binding of the tracer in the healthy rat brain. A small-animal PET scan of a rhesus monkey revealed moderate initial brain uptake (SUV, 1.9 at 1 min after injection) with a rapid washout. In the monkey, no bone uptake was detected during the 120-min scan. Conclusion: This biologic evaluation suggests that 18F-JNJ64349311 is a promising tau PET tracer candidate, with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, as compared with 18F-AV1451.",

    "abstract": "Protein misfolding is a key pathological event in neurodegenerative diseases like prion diseases, synucleinopathies, and tauopathies that are collectively termed protein misfolding disorders. Prions are a prototypic model to study protein aggregation biology and therapeutic development. Attempts to develop anti-prion therapeutics have been impeded by the lack of screening models that faithfully replicate prion diseases and the lack of rapid, sensitive biological screening systems. Therefore, a sensitive model encompassing prion replication and neurotoxicity would be indispensable to the pursuit of intervention strategies. We present an ultra-sensitive screening system coupled to an ex vivo prion organotypic slice culture model to rapidly advance rationale-based high-throughput therapeutic strategies. This hybrid Organotypic Slice Culture Assay coupled with RT-QuIC (OSCAR) permits sensitive, specific and quantitative detection of prions from an infectious slice culture model on a reduced time scale. We demonstrate that the anti-prion activity of test compounds can be readily resolved based on the power and kinetics of seeding activity in the OSCAR screening platform and that the prions generated in slice cultures are biologically active. Collectively, our results imply that OSCAR is a robust model of prion diseases that offers a promising platform for understanding prion proteinopathies and advancing anti-prion therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is an upsurge in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), which aggravates damage to cellular components viz. lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids resulting in impaired cellular functions and neurological pathologies including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we have examined amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced oxidative stress responses, a major cause for AD, in the undifferentiated and differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Abeta1-42-induced oxidative damage was evaluated on lipids by lipid peroxidation; proteins by protein carbonyls; antioxidant status by SOD and GSH enzyme activities; and DNA and RNA damage levels by evaluating the number of AP sites and 8-OHG base damages produced. In addition, the neuro-protective role of the phytochemical ginkgolide B (GB) in countering Abeta1-42-induced oxidative stress was assessed. We report that the differentiated cells are highly vulnerable to Abeta1-42-induced oxidative stress events as exerted by the deposition of Abeta in AD. Results of the current study suggest that the pre-treatment of GB, followed by Abeta1-42 treatment for 24 h, displayed neuro-protective potential, which countered Abeta1-42-induced oxidative stress responses in both undifferentiated and differentiated SH-SY5Y neuronal cells by: 1) hampering production of ROS and RNS; 2) reducing lipid peroxidation; 3) decreasing protein carbonyl content; 4) restoring antioxidant activities of SOD and GSH enzymes; and 5) maintaining genome integrity by reducing the oxidative DNA and RNA base damages. In conclusion, Abeta1-42 induces oxidative damage to the cellular biomolecules, which are associated with AD pathology, and are protected by the pre-treatment of GB against Abeta-toxicity. Taken together, this study advocates for phytochemical-based therapeutic interventions against AD.",

Because findings may differ between study populations, data came from U.S. Alzheimer's Disease Centers contributing to the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (n = 2742) and from the population-based Adult Changes in Thought study (n = 499). Regardless of study population, over 50% of participants with ADNC had co-occurring LBD or VBI; the majority of whom had a clinical AD dementia diagnosis prior to death. Overlap of pathologies was similar between studies, especially after standardizing to the distribution of age and dementia status in the Adult Changes in Thought population. LBD, but not VBI, was positively associated with ADNC in both studies. Interestingly, cortical LBD was more common in those with intermediate ADNC compared to low or high ADNC, especially in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (p < 0.001). High prevalence of co-occurring neuropathologies among older adults with dementia has implications for accurate diagnosis of dementia etiologies and development of disease-modifying strategies.",

    "title": "Peripheral administration of the soluble TNF inhibitor XPro1595 modifies brain immune cell profiles, decreases beta-amyloid plaque load, and rescues impaired long-term potentiation in 5xFAD mice.",
    "abstract": "Clinical and animal model studies have implicated inflammation and peripheral immune cell responses in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Peripheral immune cells including T cells circulate in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of healthy adults and are found in the brains of AD patients and AD rodent models. Blocking entry of peripheral macrophages into the CNS was reported to increase amyloid burden in an AD mouse model. To assess inflammation in the 5xFAD (Tg) mouse model, we first quantified central and immune cell profiles in the deep cervical lymph nodes and spleen. In the brains of Tg mice, activated (MHCII+, CD45high, and Ly6Chigh) myeloid-derived CD11b+ immune cells are decreased while CD3+ T cells are increased as a function of age relative to non-Tg mice. These immunological changes along with evidence of increased mRNA levels for several cytokines suggest that immune regulation and trafficking patterns are altered in Tg mice. Levels of soluble Tumor Necrosis Factor (sTNF) modulate blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and are increased in CSF and brain parenchyma post-mortem in AD subjects and Tg mice. We report here that in vivo peripheral administration of XPro1595, a novel biologic that sequesters sTNF into inactive heterotrimers, reduced the age-dependent increase in activated immune cells in Tg mice, while decreasing the overall number of CD4+ T cells. In addition, XPro1595 treatment in vivo rescued impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) measured in brain slices in association with decreased Abeta plaques in the subiculum. Selective targeting of sTNF may modulate brain immune cell infiltration, and prevent or delay neuronal dysfunction in AD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Immune cells and cytokines perform specialized functions inside and outside the brain to maintain optimal brain health; but the extent to which their activities change in response to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration is not well understood. Our findings indicate that neutralization of sTNF reduced the age-dependent increase in activated immune cells in Tg mice, while decreasing the overall number of CD4+ T cells. In addition, impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) was rescued by XPro1595 in association with decreased hippocampal Abeta plaques. Selective targeting of sTNF holds translational potential to modulate brain immune cell infiltration, dampen neuroinflammation, and prevent or delay neuronal dysfunction in AD.",

However, in vitro culture of neurons deprives them of their natural environment. Here we transplanted human PSC-derived cortical neuronal precursors into the brain of a murine AD model. Human neurons differentiate and integrate into the brain, express 3R/4R Tau splice forms, show abnormal phosphorylation and conformational Tau changes, and undergo neurodegeneration. Remarkably, cell death was dissociated from tangle formation in this natural 3D model of AD. Using genome-wide expression analysis, we observed upregulation of genes involved in myelination and downregulation of genes related to memory and cognition, synaptic transmission, and neuron projection. This novel chimeric model for AD displays human-specific pathological features and allows the analysis of different genetic backgrounds and mutations during the course of the disease.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of extracellular amyloid beta (Abeta42) both in brain and in cerebral vessels characterizes Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Recently, the possibility to functionalize nanoparticles (NPs) surface with Abeta42 binding molecules, making them suitable tools for reducing Abeta42 burden has been shown effective in models of AD. Aim of this work consisted in proving that NPs might be effective in sequestering Abeta42 in biological fluids, such as CSF and plasma. This demonstration is extremely important considering that these Abeta42 pools are in continuum with the brain parenchyma with drainage of Abeta from interstitial brain tissue to blood vessel and plasma. In this work, liposomes (LIP) were functionalized as previously shown in order to promote high-affinity Abeta binding, i.e., either with, phosphatidic acid (PA), or a modified Apolipoprotein E-derived peptide (mApo), or with a curcumin derivative (TREG); Abeta42 levels were determined by ELISA in CSF and plasma samples. mApo-PA-LIP (25 and 250 muM) mildly albeit significantly sequestered Abeta42 proteins in CSF samples obtained from healthy subjects (p < 0.01). Analogously a significant binding (~20%) of Abeta42 (p < 0.001) was demonstrated following exposure to all functionalized liposomes in plasma samples obtained from selected AD or Down's syndrome patients expressing high levels of Abeta42. The same results were obtained by quantifying Abeta42 content after removal of liposome-bound Abeta by using gel filtration chromatography or ultracentrifugation on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. In conclusion, we demonstrate that functionalized liposomes significantly sequester Abeta42 in human biological fluids. These data may be critical for future in vivo administration tests using NPs for promoting sink effect.",

This disease is characterized, if not provoked, by amyloid aggregates formed from Abeta peptide that deposit inside the brain or are toxic to neuronal cells. We here used scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to determine the fibril network structure and interactions of Abeta fibrils within a cell culture model of Alzheimer's disease. STEM images taken from the formed Abeta amyloid deposits revealed three main types of fibril network structures, termed amorphous meshwork, fibril bundle and amyloid star. All three were infiltrated by different types of lipid inclusions from small-sized exosome-like structures (50-100 nm diameter) to large-sized extracellular vesicles (up to 300 nm). The fibrils also presented strong interactions with the surrounding cells such that fibril bundles extended into tubular invaginations of the plasma membrane. Amyloid formation in the cell model was previously found to have an intracellular origin and we show here that it functionally destroys the integrity of the intracellular membranes as it leads to lysosomal leakage. These data provide a mechanistic link to explain why intracellular fibril formation is toxic to the cell.",

This work identified leucine enkephalin as a potentially useful starting point for the discovery of peptide-related biotherapeutics for Alzheimer's disease. In order to better understand such complexes that are formed in vitro, we describe here the analysis of a series of site-directed amino acid substitution variants of both peptides, covering the leucine enkephalin sequence in its entirety and a large number of selected residues of amyloid beta 1-40 (residues: D1, E3, F4, R5, H6, Y10, E11, H13, H14, Q15, K16, E22, K28, and V40). Ion mobility-mass spectrometry measurements and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the hydrophobic C-terminus of leucine enkephalin (Phe-Leu, FL) is crucial for the formation of peptide complexes. As such, we explore here the interaction of the dipeptide FL with both wildtype and variant forms of amyloid beta in order to structurally characterize the complexes formed. We find that FL binds preferentially to amyloid beta oligomers and attaches to amyloid beta within the region between its N-terminus and its hydrophobic core, most specifically at residues Y10 and Q15. We further show that FL is able to prevent fibril formation.",

    "abstract": "Loss of proteostasis underlies ageing and neurodegeneration characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although many neurodegenerative-disease-associated proteins can be found in mitochondria, it remains unclear how mitochondrial dysfunction and protein aggregation could be related. In dividing yeast cells, protein aggregates that form under stress or during ageing are preferentially retained by the mother cell, in part through tethering to mitochondria, while the disaggregase Hsp104 helps to dissociate aggregates and thereby enables refolding or degradation of misfolded proteins. Here we show that, in yeast, cytosolic proteins prone to aggregation are imported into mitochondria for degradation. Protein aggregates that form under heat shock contain both cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins and interact with the mitochondrial import complex. Many aggregation-prone proteins enter the mitochondrial intermembrane space and matrix after heat shock, and some do so even without stress. Timely dissolution of cytosolic aggregates requires the mitochondrial import machinery and proteases. Blocking mitochondrial import but not proteasome activity causes a marked delay in the degradation of aggregated proteins. Defects in cytosolic Hsp70s leads to enhanced entry of misfolded proteins into mitochondria and elevated mitochondrial stress. We term this mitochondria-mediated proteostasis mechanism MAGIC (mitochondria as guardian in cytosol) and provide evidence that it may exist in human cells.",

The factor XII (FXII) -initiated contact system can trigger both vascular pathology and inflammation and is activated in AD patients and AD mice. We have investigated the role of the contact system in AD pathogenesis. Cleavage of high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK), a marker for activation of the inflammatory arm of the contact system, is increased in a mouse model of AD, and this cleavage is temporally correlated with the onset of brain inflammation. Depletion of FXII in AD mice inhibited HK cleavage in plasma and reduced neuroinflammation, fibrinogen deposition, and neurodegeneration in the brain. Moreover, FXII-depleted AD mice showed better cognitive function than untreated AD mice. These results indicate that FXII-mediated contact system activation contributes to AD pathogenesis, and therefore this system may offer novel targets for AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "More than 20 genetic loci have been associated with risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but reported genome-wide significant loci do not account for all the estimated heritability and provide little information about underlying biological mechanisms. Genetic studies using intermediate quantitative traits such as biomarkers, or endophenotypes, benefit from increased statistical power to identify variants that may not pass the stringent multiple test correction in case-control studies. Endophenotypes also contain additional information helpful for identifying variants and genes associated with other aspects of disease, such as rate of progression or onset, and provide context to interpret the results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We conducted GWAS of amyloid beta (Abeta42), tau, and phosphorylated tau (ptau181) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 3146 participants across nine studies to identify novel variants associated with AD. Five genome-wide significant loci (two novel) were associated with ptau181, including loci that have also been associated with AD risk or brain-related phenotypes. Two novel loci associated with Abeta42 near GLIS1 on 1p32.3 (beta = -0.059, P = 2.08 x 10-8) and within SERPINB1 on 6p25 (beta = -0.025, P = 1.72 x 10-8) were also associated with AD risk (GLIS1: OR = 1.105, P = 3.43 x 10-2), disease progression (GLIS1: beta = 0.277, P = 1.92 x 10-2), and age at onset (SERPINB1: beta = 0.043, P = 4.62 x 10-3). Bioinformatics indicate that the intronic SERPINB1 variant (rs316341) affects expression of SERPINB1 in various tissues, including the hippocampus, suggesting that SERPINB1 influences AD through an Abeta-associated mechanism. Analyses of known AD risk loci suggest CLU and FERMT2 may influence CSF Abeta42 (P = 0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively) and the INPP5D locus may affect ptau181 levels (P = 0.009); larger studies are necessary to verify these results.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease characterized by misfolding, aggregation, and accumulation of amyloid fibrils in an insoluble form in the brain, is often known as amyloidosis. The process of aggregation follows a mechanism of seeded polymerization. For decades, a great number of failures in Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug development, with both small molecules and immunotherapies failing to establish a drug/placebo difference or having an unacceptable toxicity have led to the therapeutic research interest towards a group of anti-amyloidogenic compounds originated from plants called biophenols. A number of in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that the plant biophenols bind with amyloid beta (Abeta) toxic oligomers and reducing the fibril formation and toxicity. The exact mechanism of biophenols action against Abeta toxicity is unknown, while studies have suggested the amyloid-binding affinity of biophenols affecting Abeta on various levels, e.g. by direct inhibiting fibril formation or steering oligomer formation into unstructured, inhibiting Abeta aggregation, and promoting nontoxic pathways. Furthermore, biophenols involved in the inhibition of Abeta progression (e.g., oxidative stress and neuroinflammation) and effecting the amyloid precursor protein processing through the direct or indirect inhibition of beta-secretase (BACE-1), gamma-secretase and/or activation of alpha-secretase. This critical review account for the biophenols as magic bullet targeting against Abeta, and simulation the results on how biophenols interact with the Abeta monomers and oligomers, highly desirable knowledge for predicting new efficient nutraceutical drugs.",

    "abstract": "Brain regions affected by Alzheimer disease (AD) display well-recognized early neuropathologic features in the endolysosomal and autophagy systems of neurons, including enlargement of endosomal compartments, progressive accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, and lysosomal dysfunction. Although the primary causes of these disturbances are still under investigation, a growing body of evidence suggests that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular C-terminal fragment beta (C99), generated by cleavage of APP by beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1), is the primary cause of the endosome enlargement in AD and the earliest initiator of synaptic plasticity and long-term memory impairment. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible relationship between the endolysosomal degradation pathway and autophagy on the proteolytic processing and turnover of C99. We found that pharmacologic treatments that either inhibit autophagosome formation or block the fusion of autophagosomes to endolysosomal compartments caused an increase in C99 levels. We also found that inhibition of autophagosome formation by depletion of Atg5 led to higher levels of C99 and to its massive accumulation in the lumen of enlarged perinuclear, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1)-positive organelles. In contrast, activation of autophagosome formation, either by starvation or by inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin, enhanced lysosomal clearance of C99. Altogether, our results indicate that autophagosomes are key organelles to help avoid C99 accumulation preventing its deleterious effects.-Gonzalez, A. E., Munoz, V. C., Cavieres, V.

    "abstract": "One major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is the deposition of extracellular senile plaques and vessel wall deposits composed of amyloid-beta (Abeta). In AD, degeneration of neurons is preceded by the formation of Abeta plaques, which show different morphological forms. Most of them are birefringent owing to the parallel arrangement of amyloid fibrils. Here, we present polarization sensitive optical coherence microscopy (PS-OCM) for imaging mature neuritic Abeta plaques based on their birefringent properties. Formalin-fixed, post-mortem brain samples of advanced stage AD patients were investigated. In several cortical brain regions, neuritic Abeta plaques were successfully visualized in tomographic and three-dimensional (3D) images. Cortical grey matter appeared polarization preserving, whereas neuritic plaques caused increased phase retardation. Consistent with the results from PS-OCM imaging, the 3D structure of senile Abeta plaques was computationally modelled for different illumination settings and plaque sizes. Furthermore, the birefringent properties of cortical and meningeal vessel walls in CAA were investigated in selected samples. Significantly increased birefringence was found in smaller vessels. Overall, these results provide evidence that PS-OCM is able to assess amyloidosis based on intrinsic birefringent properties.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that mutations in the gene coding for amyloid precursor protein are responsible for autosomal dominant forms of Alzheimer's disease. Proteolytic processing of the protein leads to a number of metabolites including the amyloid beta peptide. Although brain amyloid precursor protein expression and amyloid beta production are associated with the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, it is clear that amyloid precursor protein is expressed in numerous cell types and tissues. Here we demonstrate that amyloid precursor protein is involved in regulating the phenotype of both adipocytes and peripheral macrophages and is required for high fat diet-dependent weight gain in mice. These data suggest that functions of this protein include modulation of the peripheral immune system and lipid metabolism. This biology may have relevance not only to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease but also diet-associated obesity.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by extracellular senile plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal death. Aggregated amyloid-beta (Abeta) induces inflammation and oxidative stress, which have pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of AD. Hepcidin is a key regulator of systemic iron homeostasis. Recently, an anti-inflammatory response to hepcidin was reported in macrophages. Under the hypothesis that hepcidin mediates anti-inflammatory response in the brain, in this study, we evaluated the putative anti-inflammatory role of hepcidin on Abeta-activated astrocytes and microglia. Primary culture of astrocytes and microglia were treated with Abeta, with or without hepcidin, and cytokine levels were then evaluated. In addition, the toxicity of Abeta-treated astrocyte- or microglia-conditioned media was tested on neurons, evaluating cellular death and oxidative stress generation. Finally, mice were injected in the right lateral ventricle with Abeta, with or without hepcidin, and hippocampus glial activation and oxidative stress were evaluated. Pre-treatment with hepcidin reduced the expression and secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in astrocytes and microglia treated with Abeta. Hepcidin also reduced neurotoxicity and oxidative damage triggered by conditioned media obtained from astrocytes and microglia treated with Abeta. Stereotaxic intracerebral injection of hepcidin reduced glial activation and oxidative damage triggered by Abeta injection in mice. Overall, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that in astrocytes and microglia hepcidin down-regulates the inflammatory and pro-oxidant processes induced by Abeta, thus protecting neighboring neurons. This is a newly described property of hepcidin in the central nervous system, which may be relevant for the development of strategies to prevent the neurodegenerative process associated with AD.",

Using surface plasmon resonance, we show that at neutral pH the fibrillar forms of all His-Ala variants are destabilised by a factor of 4-12 compared to wild-type Abeta.

    "title": "Synthetic toxic Abeta1-42 oligomers can assemble in different morphologies.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease associated with aggregation of Abeta peptides. Abeta toxicity is mostly related to the capacity of intermediate oligomers to disrupt membrane integrity. We previously expressed Abeta1-42 in a eukaryotic cellular system and selected synthetic variants on their sole toxicity. The most toxic mutant G37C forms stable oligomers. METHODS: Different biophysical methods (Fluorescence spectroscopy, cross-linking, mass spectrometry (MS), Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), calcein leakage) were used. RESULTS: The oligomers are mostly populated by a 14mers resulting from the packing of homodimers. These homodimers come from the formation of a disulfide bridge between two monomers. This link stabilizes the multimers and prevents the assembly into amyloid fibrils. These oligomers affect the membrane integrity. The reduction of disulfide bonds leads to a rearrangement and redirects assembly of Abeta amyloid fibrils. CONCLUSION: The toxic synthetic AbetaG37C mutant can assemble into an amyloid of unusual morphology through the formation of anti-parallel beta-sheets. This pathway involves the formation of oligomers resulting from the arrangement of Abeta dimers linked by covalent di-sulfide link, being these oligomers harmful for the membranes. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The capacity to produce large amount of stable oligomers without additional detergents or extrinsic cross-linkers allow further structural and biophysical studies to understand their capacity to assemble and disrupt the membranes, a key event in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients suffer a disturbance in the balance between synaptic (GluN2A, mediating the protective pathway) and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) (GluN2B, mediating the excitotoxic pathway), and, therefore, restoring the balance of GluN2A and GluN2B should be beneficial for AD. In this study, the GluN2B-selective antagonist, ifenprodil, and the non-selective NMDAR agonist, NMDA, had little effect on amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced long-term potentiation deficits. Enhancing the activity of GluN2A had a protective effect against Abeta, and specific activation of GluN2A and inhibition of GluN2B showed a better protective effect. In Abeta ICV-injected animals, the combination of ifenprodil and D-cycloserine (a co-activator of NMDRs similar to D-serine) led to greater improvement in behavior tests (nest building, novel object recognition, and Morris water maze) than ifenprodil (Morris water maze) or D-cycloserine (nest building) alone. Signal pathway analysis showed that Abeta disturbed the GluN2A/GluN2B-related pathway. The ratio of GluN2A to GluN2B decreased in Abeta-treated animals, and TORC dephosphorylation and ERK1/2 activation, which could be initiated by GluN2A, also decreased in the hippocampal tissues of Abeta-treated animals. As a result, the activation of CREB and the content of brain-derived BDNF decreased. The combination of ifenprodil and D-cycloserine reversed the signal pathway more significantly than ifenprodil or D-cycloserine alone, indicating that Abeta-induced toxicology was mediated both by functionally inhibiting GluN2A and enhancing GluN2B. These results indicate that enhancing synaptic NMDARs and inhibiting extrasynaptic NMDARs concurrently showed protective effects against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity, suggesting that modulation of the balance between GluN2A and GluN2B could be a potential strategy for AD drug development and therapy.",

    "abstract": "Beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) induced neurotoxicity is considered as a hallmark of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study demonstrated the neuroprotective role of 5-HT6 receptors against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in PC-12 cells. The 5-HT6 receptor agonist EMD-386088 and antagonist SB-399885 were used as pharmacological tools. The NMDA receptor antagonist, memantine, was used as reference standard. The Abeta25-35 (50 microM) induced apoptosis, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and impaired neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells. Pre-treatment with 10 microM EMD-386088 and SB-399885 had significantly protected neuronal cell death by maintaining higher cell viability through attenuation of intracellular ROS. Further, both compounds significantly prevented Abeta25-35-induced impairment in neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells. Similarly, memantine prevented Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity in PC-12 cells. These findings suggest that 5-HT6 receptor ligands have protected neurons from Abeta25-35 induced toxicity by reducing ROS and through prevention of impairment in neurite outgrowth. Therefore, 5-HT6 receptor could be an important disease-modifying therapeutic target for AD.",

    "title": "Nitration of Tyrosine Residue Y10 of Abeta1-42 Significantly Inhibits Its Aggregation and Cytotoxicity.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta plaques and oxidative stress are the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Our previous study found that the heme-Abeta complex enhanced the catalytic effect of free heme on protein tyrosine nitration in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitrite (NO2-). Y10 in Abeta could be the first target to be nitrated. We also found that nitration of Abeta1-40 significantly decreased its aggregation. However, a contrary report showed that nitration of Abeta1-42 by peroxynitrite enhanced its aggregation. To rule out the interference of peroxynitrite caused Abeta oxidation, we used synthetic Y10 nitrated Abeta1-42 to study the influence of Y10 nitration on Abeta1-42's aggregation and cytotoxicity in this study. We confirmed that Abeta1-42 could be nitrated in the presence of H2O2, NO2-, and heme by dot blotting. CD spectroscopy showed an increase of beta-sheet structure of Abeta1-42 and its mutants. The thioflavin T (ThT) flourescence assay revealed that both nitration and chlorination significantly inhibited Abeta1-42 fibril formation. TEM and AFM observations of Abeta peptide aggregates further confirmed that Y10 modification inhibited Abeta1-42 fibril formation. The cytotoxicity study of native and modified Abeta peptides on SH-SY5Y cells revealed that nitration of Abeta1-42 remarkably decreased the neurotoxicity of Abeta1-42. On the basis of these results, we hypothesized that nitration of Y10 may block the pi-pi stacking interactions of Abeta1-42 so that it inhibit its aggregation and neurotoxicity. More importantly, considerable evidence suggested that the levels of nitrite plus nitrate significantly decreased in the brain of AD patients. Thus, we believe that these findings would be helpful for further understanding the function of Abeta in AD.",

    "title": "alpha-Helix Mimetics as Modulators of Abeta Self-Assembly.",
    "abstract": "A key molecular species in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the Abeta42 alloform of Abeta peptide, which is dominant in the amyloid plaques deposited in the brains of AD patients. Recent studies have decisively demonstrated that the prefibrillar soluble oligomers are the neurotoxic culprits and are associated with the pathology of AD. Nascent Abeta42 is predominantly disordered but samples alpha-helical conformations covering residues 15-24 and 29-35 in the presence of micelles and structure-inducing solvents. In this report, a focused library of oligopyridylamide based alpha-helical mimetics was designed to target the central alpha-helix subdomain of Abeta (Abeta13-26). A tripyridylamide, ADH-41, was identified as one of the most potent antagonists of Abeta fibrillation. Amyloid-assembly kinetics, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) show that ADH-41 wholly suppresses the aggregation of Abeta at a substoichiometric dose. Dot blot and ELISA assays demonstrate the inhibition of the putative neurotoxic Abeta oligomers. ADH-41 targets Abeta in a sequence and structure-specific manner, as it did not have any effect on the aggregation of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), a peptide which shares sequence similarity with Abeta. Spectroscopic studies using NMR and CD confirm induction of alpha-helicity in Abeta mediated by ADH-41. Calorimetric and fluorescence titrations yielded binding affinity in the low micromolar range. ADH-41 was also effective at inhibiting the seed-catalyzed aggregation of Abeta probably by modulating the Abeta conformation into a fiber incompetent structure. Overall, we speculate that ADH-41 directs Abeta into off-pathway structures, and thereby alters various solution based functions of Abeta. Cell-based assays to assess the effect of ADH-41 on Abeta are underway and will be presented in due course.",

    "abstract": "Recent experimental data revealed that small, soluble Amyloid beta (Abeta42) oligomers, especially dimers impair synaptic plasticity and memory leading to Alzheimer's disease. Here, we have studied dimerization of Abeta42/Abeta42 homo-dimer and Abeta40/Abeta42 hetero-dimer in terms of free energy profile by all-atom simulations using the ff99SB force field. We have found that in the presence of Abeta40 peptide, there exists a strong tendency to form a hetero-dimer with Abeta42 peptide, suggesting that a possible co-oligomerization. Furthermore, we have investigated the effects of Abeta40 on the Abeta42 peptide. Our study also shows that in presence of Abeta40, the beta-content of Abeta42 monomer is reduced. Additionally, certain residues important for bending in Abeta42 peptide attained an increased flexibility in the presence of Abeta40. The salt-bridge destabilization also manifested the impact of Abeta40 on Abeta42 peptide as a whole. Based on this, one may expect that Abeta40 inhibits the aggregation propensity of Abeta42. Moreover, the binding free energy obtained by the molecular mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann surface area method also revealed a strong affinity between the two isoforms thereby suggests that Abeta40 binding induces conformational change in Abeta42. Our results suggest that co-oligomerization of Abeta isoforms may play a substantial role in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: In the brain, amyloid-beta generation participates in the pathophysiology of cognitive disorders; in the bloodstream, the role of amyloid-beta is uncertain but may be linked to sterile inflammation and senescence. We explored the relationship between blood levels of amyloid-beta 1-40 peptide (Abeta40), cognition, and mortality (all-cause, cardiovascular, and heart failure [HF]-related) in ambulatory patients with HF. METHODS: Bloodstream Abeta40 was measured in 939 consecutive patients with HF. Cognition was evaluated with the Pfeiffer questionnaire (adjusted for educational level) at baseline and during follow-up. Multivariate Cox regression analyses and measurements of performance (discrimination, calibration, and reclassification) were used, with competing risk for specific causes of death. RESULTS: Over 5.1 +- 2.9 years, 471 patients died (all-cause): 250 from cardiovascular causes and 131 HF-related. The median Abeta40 concentration was 519.1 pg/mL [Q1-Q3: 361.8-749.9 pg/mL]. The Abeta40 concentration correlated with age, body mass index, renal dysfunction, and New York Heart Association functional class (all P < .001). There were no differences in Abeta40 in patients with and without cognitive impairment at baseline (P = .97) or during follow-up (P = .20). In multivariable analysis, including relevant clinical predictors and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, Abeta40 remained significantly associated with all-cause death (HR, 1.22; 95%CI, 1.10-1.35; P < .001) and cardiovascular death (HR, 1.18; 95%CI, 1.03-1.36; P = .02), but not with HF-related death (HR, 1.13; 95%CI, 0.93-1.37; P = .22). Circulating Abeta40 improved calibration and patient reclassification. CONCLUSIONS: Blood levels of Abeta40 are not associated with cognitive decline in HF. Circulating Abeta40 was predictive of mortality and may indicate systemic aging.",

    "abstract": "A series of novel ferulic acid-O-alkylamines derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as multitarget-directed ligands against Alzheimer's disease. In vitro studies displayed that all the synthesized target compounds showed impressive inhibitory activity against butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), significant inhibition/disaggregation of self-induced beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation and acted as potential antioxidants. Particularly, compound 7f, one of the most potent BuChE inhibitor (IC50 value of 0.021 muM for equine serum BuChE, 8.63 muM for ratBuChE and 0.07 muM for human serum BuChE), was found to be a good acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor (IC50 = 2.13 muM for electric eel AChE, 1.8 muM for ratAChE and 3.82 muM for human erythrocytes AChE), and the result of molecular docking provided an explanation for its selective BuChE inhibitory activity. Compound 7f also had noteworthy inhibitory effects on self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation (50.8 +- 0.82%) and was found to disaggregate self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation (38.7 +- 0.65%), which was further elucidated by the transmission electron microscopy. Meanwhile, compound 7f showed the modest antioxidant activity (0.55 eq of Trolox), good protective effect against H2O2-induced PC12 cell injury, with low toxicity. Moreover, compound 7f could cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro. Significantly, compound 7f did not exhibit any acute toxicity in mice at doses up to 1000 mg/kg, and the step-down passive avoidance test showed this compound significantly reversed scopolamine-induced memory deficit in mice. Taken together, the results indicated that compound 7f is a very promising multifunctional agent in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, particularly the advanced stages of AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The entorhinal cortex, a critical gateway between the neocortex and hippocampus, is one of the earliest regions affected by Alzheimer disease-associated neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Although our prior work has automatically delineated an MR imaging-based measure of the entorhinal cortex, whether antemortem entorhinal cortex thickness is associated with postmortem tangle burden within the entorhinal cortex is still unknown. Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between antemortem MRI measures of entorhinal cortex thickness and postmortem neuropathological measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 50 participants from the Rush Memory and Aging Project with antemortem structural T1-weighted MR imaging and postmortem neuropathologic assessments. Here, we focused on thickness within the entorhinal cortex as anatomically defined by our previously developed MR imaging parcellation system (Desikan-Killiany Atlas in FreeSurfer). Using linear regression, we evaluated the association between entorhinal cortex thickness and tangles and amyloid-beta load within the entorhinal cortex and medial temporal and neocortical regions. RESULTS: We found a significant relationship between antemortem entorhinal cortex thickness and entorhinal cortex (P = .006) and medial temporal lobe tangles (P = .002); we found no relationship between entorhinal cortex thickness and entorhinal cortex (P = .09) and medial temporal lobe amyloid-beta (P = .09). We also found a significant association between entorhinal cortex thickness and cortical tangles (P = .003) and amyloid-beta (P = .01). We found no relationship between parahippocampal gyrus thickness and entorhinal cortex (P = .31) and medial temporal lobe tangles (P = .051). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that entorhinal cortex-associated in vivo cortical thinning may represent a marker of postmortem medial temporal and neocortical Alzheimer disease pathology.",

    "title": "Overlapping but distinct TDP-43 and tau pathologic patterns in aged hippocampi.",
    "abstract": "Intracellular proteinaceous aggregates (inclusion bodies) are almost always detectable at autopsy in brains of elderly individuals. Inclusion bodies composed of TDP-43 and tau proteins often coexist in the same brain, and each of these pathologic biomarkers is associated independently with cognitive impairment. However, uncertainties remain about how the presence and neuroanatomical distribution of inclusion bodies correlate with underlying diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed data from the University of Kentucky AD Center autopsy series (n = 247); none of the brains had frontotemporal lobar degeneration. A specific question for this study was whether neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology outside of the Braak NFT staging scheme is characteristic of brains with TDP-43 pathology but lacking AD, that is those with cerebral age-related TDP-43 with sclerosis (CARTS). We also tested whether TDP-43 pathology is associated with comorbid AD pathology, and whether argyrophilic grains are relatively likely to be present in cases with, vs. without, TDP-43 pathology. Consistent with prior studies, hippocampal TDP-43 pathology was associated with advanced AD - Braak NFT stages V/VI. However, argyrophilic grain pathology was not more common in cases with TDP-43 pathology in this data set. In brains with CARTS (TDP-43[+]/AD[-] cases), there were more NFTs in dentate granule neurons than were seen in TDP-43[-]/AD[-] cases. These dentate granule cell NFTs could provide a proxy indicator of CARTS pathology in cases lacking substantial AD pathology. Immunofluorescent experiments in a subsample of cases found that, in both advanced AD and CARTS, approximately 1% of dentate granule neurons were PHF-1 immunopositive, whereas ~25% of TDP-43 positive cells showed colocalized PHF-1 immunoreactivity. We conclude that NFTs in hippocampal dentate granule neurons are often present in CARTS, and TDP-43 pathology may be secondary to or occurring in parallel with tauopathy.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-related diseases are characterized by protein conformational change and amyloid fibril deposition. Metal complexes are potential inhibitors of amyloidosis. Nitrogen-coordinated gold complexes have been used to disaggregate prion neuropeptide (PrP106-126) and human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP). However, the roles of metal complexes in peptide fibril formation and related bioactivity require further exploration. In this work, we investigated the interactions of amyloid peptides PrP106-126 and hIAPP with two tetracoordinated gold-sulfur complexes, namely, dichloro diethyl dithiocarbamate gold complex and dichloro pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate gold complex. We also determined the effects of these complexes on peptide-induced cytotoxicity. Thioflavin T assay, morphological characterization, and particle size analysis indicated that the two gold-sulfur complexes effectively inhibited the fibrillation of the amyloid peptides, which led to the formation of nanoscale particles. The complexes reduced the cytotoxicity induced by the amyloid peptides. Intrinsic fluorescence, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry revealed that the complexes interacted with PrP106-126 and hIAPP via metal coordination and hydrophobic interaction, which improved the inhibition and binding of the two gold-sulfur compounds. Our study provided new insights into the use of tetracoordinated gold-sulfur complexes as drug candidates against protein conformational disorders.",

    "title": "Humanin Specifically Interacts with Amyloid-beta Oligomers and Counteracts Their in vivo Toxicity.",
    "abstract": "The 24-residue peptide humanin (HN) has been proposed as a peptide-based inhibitor able to interact directly with amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers and interfere with the formation and/or biological properties of toxic Abeta species. When administered exogenously, HN, or its synthetic S14G-derivative (HNG), exerted multiple cytoprotective effects, counteracting the Abeta-induced toxicity. Whether these peptides interact directly with Abeta, particularly with the soluble oligomeric assemblies, remains largely unknown. We here investigated the ability of HN and HNG to interact directly with highly aggregating Abeta42, and interfere with the formation and toxicity of its oligomers. Experiments were run in cell-free conditions and in vivo in a transgenic C. elegans strain in which the Abeta toxicity was specifically due to oligomeric species. Thioflavin-T assay indicated that both HN and HNG delay the formation and reduce the final amount of Abeta42 fibrils. In vitro surface plasmon resonance studies indicated that they interact with Abeta42 oligomers favoring the formation of amorphous larger assemblies, observed with turbidity and electron microscopy. In vivo studies indicated that both HN and HNG decrease the relative abundance of A11-positive prefibrillar oligomers as well as OC-positive fibrillar oligomers and had similar protective effects. However, while HN possibly decreased the oligomers by promoting their assembly into larger aggregates, the reduction of oligomers caused by HNG can be ascribed to a marked decrease of the total Abeta levels, likely the consequence of the HNG-induced overexpression of the Abeta-degrading enzyme neprilysin. These findings provide information on the mechanisms underlying the anti-oligomeric effects of HN and HNG and illustrate the role of S14G substitution in regulating the in vivo mechanism of action.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease and a growing health problem worldwide. Because the drugs currently used to treat AD have certain drawbacks such as single targeting, there is a need to develop novel multi-target compounds, among which oxoisoaporphine alkaloid derivatives are promising candidates. In this study, the possible anti-AD activities of 14 novel oxoisoaporphine alkaloid derivatives that we synthesized were screened and evaluated. We found that, in the 14 novel derivatives, compound 8-1 significantly reduced Abeta1-42 secretion in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing the Swedish mutant form of human beta-amyloid precursor protein (APPsw). Next, we found that compound 8-1 could down-regulate the expression level of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in APPsw cells. Moreover, compound 8-1 significantly delayed paralysis in the Abeta1-42-transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans strain GMC101, which could be explained by the fact that compound 8-1 down-regulated acetylcholinesterase activity, protected against H2O2-induced acute oxidative stress and paraquat-induced chronic oxidative stress, and enhanced autophagy activity. Taken together, our data suggest that compound 8-1 could attenuate the onset and development of AD.",

    "abstract": "Reducing levels of the aggregation-prone Abeta peptide that accumulates in the brain with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been a major target of experimental therapies. An alternative approach may be to stabilize the physiological conformation of Abeta. To date, the physiological state of Abeta in brain remains unclear, since the available methods used to process brain tissue for determination of Abeta aggregate conformation can in themselves alter the structure and/or composition of the aggregates. Here, using synchrotron-based Fourier transform infrared micro-spectroscopy, non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and conformational specific antibodies we show that the physiological conformations of Abeta and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in brain of transgenic mouse models of AD are altered before formation of amyloid plaques. Furthermore, focal Abeta aggregates in brain that precede amyloid plaque formation localize to synaptic terminals. These changes in the states of Abeta and APP that occur prior to plaque formation may provide novel targets for AD therapy.",

Objective: To gain a better understanding of the factors that affect the natural history of progression in Alzheimer disease for the purpose of improving both clinical care and clinical trial design. Design, Setting, and Participants: A longitudinal cohort study of aging from 2005 to 2014 in the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center. Clinical evaluation of the participants was conducted in 31 National Institute on Aging's Alzheimer Disease Centers. Nine hundred eighty-four participants in the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center cohort study who died and underwent autopsy and met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Main Outcomes and Measures: We sought to model the possibility that knowledge of neurofibrillary tangle burden in the presence of moderate or frequent plaques would add to the ability to predict clinical rate of progression during the ensuing 2 to 3 years. We examined the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center autopsy data to evaluate the effect of different neurofibrillary tangle stages on the rates of progression on several standard clinical instruments: the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes, a verbal memory test (logical memory), and a controlled oral word association task (vegetable naming), implementing a reverse-time longitudinal modeling approach in conjunction with latent class estimation to adjust for unmeasured sources of heterogeneity. Results: Several correlations between clinical variables and neurocognitive performance suggest a basis for heterogeneity: Higher education level was associated with lower Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes (beta = -0.19; P < .001), and frequent vs moderate neuritic plaques were associated with higher Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes (beta = 1.64; P < .001) and lower logical memory score (beta = -1.07; P = .005). The rate of change of the clinical and cognitive scores varied depending on Braak stage, when adjusting for plaques, age of death, sex, education, and APOE genotype. For example, comparing high vs low Braak stage with other variables fixed, the logical memory score decreased a substantial 0.38 additional units per year (95% CI, -0.70 to -0.06; P = .02). Using these data, we estimate that a 300-participant clinical trial with end point of a 20% improvement in slope in rate of change of Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes has 89% power when all participants in the trial are from the high Braak stage, compared with 29% power if Braak stage had not used for eligibility. Conclusions and Relevance: We found that knowledge of neurofibrillary tangle stage, modeled as the sort of information that could be available from tau positron-emission tomography scans and its use to determine eligibility to a trial, could dramatically improve the power of clinical trials and equivalently reduce the required sample sizes of clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide plays a major role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and occurs in multiple forms, including pyroglutamylated Abeta (AbetapE). Identification and characterization of the most cytotoxic Abeta species is necessary for advancement in AD diagnostics and therapeutics. While in brain tissue multiple Abeta species act in combination, structure/toxicity studies and immunotherapy trials have been focused on individual forms of Abeta. As a result, the molecular composition and the structural features of \"toxic Abeta oligomers\" have remained unresolved. Here, we have used a novel approach, hydration from gas phase coupled with isotope-edited Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, to identify the prefibrillar assemblies formed by Abeta and AbetapE and to resolve the structures of both peptides in combination. The peptides form unusual beta-sheet oligomers stabilized by intramolecular H-bonding as opposed to intermolecular H-bonding in the fibrils. Time-dependent morphological changes in peptide assemblies have been visualized by atomic force microscopy. Abeta/AbetapE hetero-oligomers exert unsurpassed cytotoxic effect on PC12 cells as compared to oligomers of individual peptides or fibrils. These findings lead to a novel concept that Abeta/AbetapE hetero-oligomers, not just Abeta or AbetapE oligomers, constitute the main neurotoxic conformation. The hetero-oligomers thus present a new biomarker that may be targeted for development of more efficient diagnostic and immunotherapeutic strategies to combat AD.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in the pathological mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), which plays a central role in AD pathogenesis, is reported to accumulate within mitochondria. However, a question remains as to whether Abeta is generated locally from amyloid precursor protein (APP) within mitochondria. We investigated this issue by analyzing the expression patterns of APP, APP-processing secretases, and APP metabolites in mitochondria separated from human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and those expressing Swedish mutant APP. APP, BACE1, and PEN-2 protein levels were significantly lower in crude mitochondria than microsome fractions while those of ADAM10 and the other gamma-secretase complex components (presenilin 1, nicastrin, and APH-1) were comparable between fractions. The crude mitochondrial fraction containing substantial levels of cathepsin D, a lysosomal marker, was further separated via iodixanol gradient centrifugation to obtain mitochondria- and lysosome-enriched fractions. Mature APP, BACE1, and all gamma-secretase complex components (in particular, presenilin 1 and PEN-2) were scarcely present in the mitochondria-enriched fraction, compared to the lysosome-enriched fraction. Moreover, expression of the beta-C-terminal fragment (beta-CTF) of APP was markedly low in the mitochondria-enriched fraction. Additionally, immunocytochemical analysis showed very little co-localization between presenilin 1 and Tom20, a marker protein of mitochondria. In view of the particularly low expression levels of BACE1, gamma-secretase complex proteins, and beta-CTF in mitochondria, we propose that it is unlikely that Abeta generation from APP occurs locally within this organelle.",

    "abstract": "AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is a key player in energy sensing and metabolic reprogramming under cellular energy restriction. Several studies have linked impaired AMPK function to peripheral metabolic diseases such as diabetes. However, the impact of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer disease (AD), on AMPK function and downstream effects of altered AMPK activity on neuronal metabolism have been investigated only recently. Here, we report the impact of Abeta oligomers (AbetaOs), synaptotoxins that accumulate in AD brains, on neuronal AMPK activity. Short-term exposure of cultured rat hippocampal neurons or ex vivo human cortical slices to AbetaOs transiently decreased intracellular ATP levels and AMPK activity, as evaluated by its phosphorylation at threonine residue 172 (AMPK-Thr(P)172). The AbetaO-dependent reduction in AMPK-Thr(P)172 levels was mediated by glutamate receptors of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subtype and resulted in removal of glucose transporters (GLUTs) from the surfaces of dendritic processes in hippocampal neurons. Importantly, insulin prevented the AbetaO-induced inhibition of AMPK. Our results establish a novel toxic impact of AbetaOs on neuronal metabolism and suggest that AbetaO-induced, NMDA receptor-mediated AMPK inhibition may play a key role in early brain metabolic defects in AD.",

    "title": "Cerebrospinal Fluid Clearance in Alzheimer Disease Measured with Dynamic PET.",
    "abstract": "Evidence supporting the hypothesis that reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clearance is involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD) comes primarily from rodent models. However, unlike rodents, in which predominant extracranial CSF egress is via olfactory nerves traversing the cribriform plate, human CSF clearance pathways are not well characterized. Dynamic PET with 18F-THK5117, a tracer for tau pathology, was used to estimate the ventricular CSF time-activity as a biomarker for CSF clearance. We tested 3 hypotheses: extracranial CSF is detected at the superior turbinates; CSF clearance is reduced in AD; and CSF clearance is inversely associated with amyloid deposition. Methods: Fifteen subjects, 8 with AD and 7 normal control volunteers, were examined with 18F-THK5117. Ten subjects additionally underwent 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (11C-PiB) PET scanning, and 8 were 11C-PiB-positive. Ventricular time-activity curves of 18F-THK5117 were used to identify highly correlated time-activity curves from extracranial voxels. Results: For all subjects, the greatest density of CSF-positive extracranial voxels was in the nasal turbinates. Tracer concentration analyses validated the superior nasal turbinate CSF signal intensity. AD patients showed ventricular tracer clearance reduced by 23% and 66% fewer superior turbinate CSF egress sites. Ventricular CSF clearance was inversely associated with amyloid deposition. Conclusion: The human nasal turbinate is part of the CSF clearance system. Lateral ventricle and superior nasal turbinate CSF clearance abnormalities are found in AD. Ventricular CSF clearance reductions are associated with increased brain amyloid depositions. These data suggest that PET-measured CSF clearance is a biomarker of potential interest in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine whether improvements in aerobic capacity (VO2peak ) and strength after progressive resistance training (PRT) mediate improvements in cognitive function. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, double-sham, controlled trial. SETTING: University research facility. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling older adults (aged >=55) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (N = 100). INTERVENTION: PRT and cognitive training (CT), 2 to 3 days per week for 6 months. MEASUREMENTS: Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog); global, executive, and memory domains; peak strength (1 repetition maximum); and VO2peak . RESULTS: PRT increased upper (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.69, 95% confidence interval = 0.47, 0.91), lower (SMD = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.69-1.20) and whole-body (SMD = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.62-1.05) strength and percentage change in VO2peak (8.0%, 95% CI = 2.2-13.8) significantly more than sham exercise. Higher strength scores, but not greater VO2peak , were significantly associated with improvements in cognition (P < .05). Greater lower body strength significantly mediated the effect of PRT on ADAS-Cog improvements (indirect effect: beta = -0.64, 95% CI = -1.38 to -0.004; direct effect: beta = -0.37, 95% CI = -1.51-0.78) and global domain (indirect effect: beta = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.02-0.22; direct effect: beta = -0.003, 95% CI = -0.17-0.16) but not for executive domain (indirect effect: beta = 0.11, 95% CI = -0.04-0.26; direct effect: beta = 0.03, 95% CI = -0.17-0.23). CONCLUSION: High-intensity PRT results in significant improvements in cognitive function, muscle strength, and aerobic capacity in older adults with MCI. Strength gains, but not aerobic capacity changes, mediate the cognitive benefits of PRT. Future investigations are warranted to determine the physiological mechanisms linking strength gains and cognitive benefits.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to evaluate brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) using amyloid PET imaging and clarify the relationship between the annual change in Abeta deposition and disease progression. Forty-eight MCI patients underwent neuropsychological assessment and amyloid PET imaging using [11C]-PIB over a follow-up of 5.7+-1.5 years. Thirty-nine MCI patients who had an amyloid-positive scan were defined as MCI due to AD, and 9 MCI patients who had an amyloid-negative scan were included. Regions of interest were defined on co-registered MRI, and the PIB standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) on the same regions was used over follow-up. Annual change in PIB SUVR was calculated. Patients with MCI due to AD had higher baseline PIB SUVR (1.81+-0.32, n = 39, p < 0.01) and a greater annual rate of change in PIB SUVR (0.044+-0.027, n = 39, p < 0.01) compared to amyloid-negative MCI patients. Twenty-eight (71.8%) progressed to AD. In patients who progressed during a short duration of 1.7+-0.8 years, the annual rate of increase in PIB SUVR was 0.101+-0.094 (n = 16, p < 0.05), which was greater compared to patients with long conversion or stable patients. There was a negative correlation between the annual rate of increase in PIB SUVR and duration of progression to AD among individual MCI converters (r = -0.47, n = 28, p < 0.05). The patients defined as MCI due to AD could progress to AD with a shorter period if they have a greater increased annual rate in brain Abeta deposition.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sleep is an important physiological process and beneficial in the removal of brain metabolites and functional recovery. Prior studies have shown that sleep disorders are significant risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to characterize the effect of short-term total sleep deprivation (TSD) on plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) concentrations. METHODS: A clinical trial was conducted between March 1, 2016, and April 1, 2016. Twenty volunteers (age 27.3+-3.4 years) with normal cognitive function and sleeping habits were recruited from the local population. Participants underwent 24 h of TSD. Periprocedural blood samples were collected to compare the changes of plasma Abeta42, Abeta40, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (sLRP-1), soluble receptors for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), and serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malonaldehyde (MDA). RESULTS: TSD increased morning plasma Abeta40 levels by 32.6% (p < 0.001) and decreased the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio by 19.3% (p < 0.001). A positive relationship was found between TSD duration and plasma Abeta40 level (r = 0.51, p < 0.001) and Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio (r = 0.25, p = 0.003). Plasma concentrations of sLRP1 (p = 0.018) and sRAGE (p = 0.001) decreased significantly after TSD. Abeta40 and Abeta42 plasma concentrations correlated with plasma levels of sLRP1 and sRAGE. Serum SOD decreased after TSD (p = 0.005), whereas serum MDA was increased (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Sleep deprivation can lead to an elevation of plasma Abeta40 and decrease of the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio. The underlying mechanisms may be related to increased oxidative stress and impaired peripheral Abeta clearance as pathomechanisms of AD.",

This study aimed at investigating changes in neuroimaging biomarkers, according to the age of onset of the disease, in mild amnestic Alzheimer's disease patients with positive amyloid biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid. Both patient groups were impaired on tasks assessing verbal and visual recognition memory. EOAD patients showed greater executive and linguistic deficits, while LOAD patients showed greater semantic memory impairment. In EOAD and LOAD, hypometabolism involved the bilateral temporoparietal junction and the posterior cingulate cortex. In EOAD, atrophy was widespread, including frontotemporoparietal areas, whereas it was limited to temporal regions in LOAD. Atrophic volumes were greater in EOAD than in LOAD. Hypometabolic volumes were similar in the 2 groups. Greater extent of atrophy in EOAD, despite similar extent of hypometabolism, could reflect different underlying pathophysiological processes, different glucose-based compensatory mechanisms or distinct level of premorbid atrophic lesions.",

    "title": "Amyloid Precursor Protein in Drosophila Glia Regulates Sleep and Genes Involved in Glutamate Recycling.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid precursor protein (App) plays a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease via the production and deposition of toxic beta-amyloid peptides. App is heavily expressed in neurons, the focus of the vast majority of studies investigating its function. Meanwhile, almost nothing is known about App's function in glia, where it is also expressed, and can potentially participate in the regulation of neuronal physiology. In this report, we investigated whether Appl, the Drosophila homolog of App, could influence sleep-wake regulation when its function is manipulated in glial cells. Appl inhibition in astrocyte-like and cortex glia resulted in higher sleep amounts and longer sleep bout duration during the night, while overexpression had the opposite effect. These sleep phenotypes were not the result of developmental defects, and were correlated with changes in expression in glutamine synthetase (GS) in astrocyte-like glia and in changes in the gap-junction component innexin2 in cortex glia. Downregulating both GS and innexin2, but not either one individually, resulted in higher sleep amounts, similarly to Appl inhibition. Consistent with these results, the expression of GS and innexin2 are increased following sleep deprivation, indicating that GS and innexin2 genes are dynamically linked to vigilance states. Interestingly, the reduction of GS expression and the sleep phenotype observed upon Appl inhibition could be rescued by increasing the expression of the glutamate transporter dEaat1. In contrast, reducing dEaat1 expression severely disrupted sleep. These results associate glutamate recycling, sleep, and a glial function for the App family proteins.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The amyloid precursor protein (App) has been intensively studied for its implication in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The attributed functions of App are linked to the physiology and cellular biology of neurons where the protein is predominantly expressed. Consequences on glia in AD are generally thought to be secondary effects of the pathology in neurons. Researchers still do not know whether App plays a role in glia in nonpathological conditions. We report here that glial App plays a role in physiology and in the regulation of sleep/wake, which has been shown recently to be involved in AD pathology. These results also associate glutamate recycling and sleep regulation, adding further complexity to the physiological role of App and to its implication in AD.",

    "title": "Phases of Hyperconnectivity and Hypoconnectivity in the Default Mode and Salience Networks Track with Amyloid and Tau in Clinically Normal Individuals.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by two hallmark molecular pathologies: amyloid abeta1-42 and Tau neurofibrillary tangles. To date, studies of functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) in individuals with preclinical AD have relied on associations with in vivo measures of amyloid pathology. With the recent advent of in vivo Tau-PET tracers it is now possible to extend investigations on fcMRI in a sample of cognitively normal elderly humans to regional measures of Tau. We modeled fcMRI measures across four major cortical association networks [default-mode network (DMN), salience network (SAL), dorsal attention network, and frontoparietal control network] as a function of global cortical amyloid [Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET] and regional Tau (AV1451-PET) in entorhinal, inferior temporal (IT), and inferior parietal cortex. Results showed that the interaction term between PiB and IT AV1451 was significantly associated with connectivity in the DMN and salience. The interaction revealed that amyloid-positive (abeta+) individuals show increased connectivity in the DMN and salience when neocortical Tau levels are low, whereas abeta+ individuals demonstrate decreased connectivity in these networks as a function of elevated Tau-PET signal. This pattern suggests a hyperconnectivity phase followed by a hypoconnectivity phase in the course of preclinical AD.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This article offers a first look at the relationship between Tau-PET imaging with F18-AV1451 and functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) in the context of amyloid-PET imaging. The results suggest a nonlinear relationship between fcMRI and both Tau-PET and amyloid-PET imaging. The pattern supports recent conjecture that the AD fcMRI trajectory is characterized by periods of both hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity. Furthermore, this nonlinear pattern can account for the sometimes conflicting reports of associations between amyloid and fcMRI in individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Although amyloid beta protein (Abeta) has been recognized as one of the main pathological characteristics in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the effective strategies against Abeta neurotoxicity are still deficient up to now. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a natural gut hormone, was found to be effective in modulating insulin signaling and neural protection, but short half-life limited its clinical application in AD treatment. CJC-1131, a newly designed GLP-1 analogue with very longer half-life, has shown good effectiveness in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, it is unclear whether CJC-1131 could alleviate Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in cognitive behavior and electrophysiological property. The present study investigated the effects of CJC-1131 on the Abeta-induced impairments in spatial memory and synaptic plasticity of rats by using Morris water maze test and in vivo field potential recording. The results showed that Abeta1-42-induced increase in the escape latency of rats in hidden platform test and decrease in swimming time percent in target quadrant were effectively reversed by CJC-1131 pretreatment. Further, CJC-1131 prevented against Abeta1-42-induced suppression of hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP). In addition, Abeta1-42 injection resulted in a significant decrease of p-PKA in the hippocampus, which was effectively prevented by CJC-1131 treatment. These results indicated that CJC-1131 protected the cognitive function and synaptic plasticity of rats against Abeta-induced impairments, suggesting that GLP-1 analogue CJC-1131 might be potentially beneficial to the prevention and treatment of AD, especially those with T2DM or blood glucose abnormality.",

Objective: To examine patterns of neurodegeneration in individuals with SNAP compared with their Abeta+ counterparts. Design, Setting, and Participants: A longitudinal cohort study was conducted among individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal individuals receiving care at Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative sites in the United States and Canada for a mean follow-up period of 30.5 months from August 1, 2005, to June 30, 2015. Several neurodegeneration biomarkers and longitudinal cognitive function were compared between patients with distinct SNAP (Abeta- and neurodegeneration-positive [Abeta-N+]) subtypes and their Abeta+N+ counterparts. Main Outcomes and Measures: Participants were classified according to the results of their florbetapir F-18 (Abeta) positron emission tomography and their Alzheimer disease-associated neurodegeneration status (temporoparietal glucose metabolism determined by fluorodeoxyglucose F 18 [FDG]-labeled positron emission tomography and/or hippocampal volume [HV] determined by magnetic resonance imaging: participants with subthreshold HV values were regarded as exhibiting hippocampal volume atrophy [HV+], while subthreshold mean FDG values were considered as FDG hypometabolism [FDG+]). Results: The study comprised 265 cognitively normal individuals (135 women and 130 men; mean [SD] age, 75.5 [6.7] years) and 522 patients with MCI (225 women and 297 men; mean [SD] age, 72.6 [7.8] years). A total of 469 individuals with MCI had data on neurodegeneration biomarkers; of these patients, 107 were Abeta-N+ (22.8%; 63 FDG+, 82 HV+, and 38 FDG+HV+) and 187 were Abeta+N+ (39.9%; 135 FDG+, 147 HV+, and 95 FDG+HV+ cases). A total of 209 cognitively normal participants had data on neurodegeneration biomarkers; of these, 52 were Abeta-N+ (24.9%; 30 FDG+, 33 HV+, and 11 FDG+HV+) and 37 were Abeta+N+ (17.7%; 22 FDG+, 26 HV+, and 11 FDG+HV+). Compared with their Abeta+ counterparts, all patients with MCI SNAP subtypes displayed better preservation of temporoparietal FDG metabolism (mean [SD] FDG: Abeta-N+, 1.25 [0.11] vs Abeta+N+, 1.19 [0.11]), less severe atrophy of the lateral temporal lobe, and lower mean (SD) cerebrospinal fluid levels of tau (59.2 [32.8] vs 111.3 [56.4]). In MCI with SNAP, sustained glucose metabolism and gray matter volume were associated with disproportionately low APOE epsilon4 (Abeta-N+, 18.7% vs Abeta+N+, 70.6%) and disproportionately high APOE epsilon2 (18.7% vs 4.8%) carrier prevalence. Slower cognitive decline and lower rates of progression to Alzheimer disease (Abeta-N+, 6.5% vs Abeta+N+, 32.6%) were also seen in patients with MCI with SNAP subtypes compared with their Abeta+ counterparts. In cognitively normal individuals, neurodegeneration biomarkers did not differ between Abeta-N+ and Abeta+N+ cases. Conclusions and Relevance: In MCI with SNAP, low APOE epsilon4 and high APOE epsilon2 carrier prevalence may account for differences in neurodegeneration patterns between Abeta-N+ and Abeta+N+ cases independent from the neuroimaging biomarker modality used to define neurodegeneration associated with Alzheimer disease.",

The mitochondrial localization and interaction with APP (beta-amyloid precursor protein) suggest that HMGCS2 may play a role in the pathophysiology of AD (Alzheimer's disease). Here we report that overexpression of HMGCS2 decreased levels of APP and related CTFs (carboxy-terminal fragments), which was largely prevented by an autophagic inhibitor chloroquine. In addition, HMGCS2 enhancement of autophagic marker LC3II was diminished by rapamycin, an inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin. Moreover, deprivation of EBSS (Earle's Balanced Salt Solution) significantly augmented the effect of HMGCS2 on LC3II, while acetoacetate reversed the reduction of LC3II, APP and CTFs which was induced by HMGCS2 knockdown. In the presence of acetoacetate, rapamycin failed to induce further increase of LC3II, which mimicked the effect of HMGCS2 overexpression. Finally, HMGCS2 enhanced the antioxidant response. Collectively, HMGCS2 shares with ketone bodies common features in autophagic clearance of APP and CTFs, suggesting that ketone bodies play an important role in HMGCS2 regulation of the autophagy.",

METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) systematic review guidelines, we systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and PsycINFO databases from January 2000 to September 2015. RESULTS: Our search returned 492 articles, 34 of which met criteria for inclusion in the final selection. Most studies reported no significant relationships between amyloid beta and WMH burden across diagnostic groups. DISCUSSION: Findings of this systematic review suggest that amyloid accumulation and WMH are independent but additive processes. The limited number of independent cohorts, lack of longitudinal data, and exclusion of individuals with mixed dementia limit the generalizability of these findings. Further studies are required to elucidate the putative contributions of vascular processes to neurodegenerative pathology.",

    "title": "Monocular denervation of visual nuclei modulates APP processing and sAPPalpha production: A possible role on neural plasticity.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is essential to physiological processes such as synapse formation and neural plasticity. Sequential proteolysis of APP by beta- and gamma-secretases generates amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), the main component of senile plaques in Alzheimer Disease. Alternative APP cleavage by alpha-secretase occurs within Abeta domain, releasing soluble alpha-APP (sAPPalpha), a neurotrophic fragment. Among other functions, sAPPalpha is important to synaptogenesis, neural survival and axonal growth. APP and sAPPalpha levels are increased in models of neuroplasticity, which suggests an important role for APP and its metabolites, especially sAPPalpha, in the rearranging brain. In this work we analyzed the effects of monocular enucleation (ME), a classical model of lesion-induced plasticity, upon APP content, processing and also in secretases levels. Besides, we addressed whether alpha-secretase activity is crucial for retinotectal remodeling after ME. Our results showed that ME induced a transient reduction in total APP content. We also detected an increase in alpha-secretase expression and in sAPP production concomitant with a reduction in Abeta and beta-secretase contents. These data suggest that ME facilitates APP processing by the non-amyloidogenic pathway, increasing sAPPalpha levels. Indeed, the pharmacological inhibition of alpha-secretase activity reduced the axonal sprouting of ipsilateral retinocollicular projections from the intact eye after ME, suggesting that sAPPalpha is necessary for synaptic structural rearrangement. Understanding how APP processing is regulated under lesion conditions may provide new insights into APP physiological role on neural plasticity.",

    "title": "Genetic assessment of age-associated Alzheimer disease risk: Development and validation of a polygenic hazard score.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Identifying individuals at risk for developing Alzheimer disease (AD) is of utmost importance. Although genetic studies have identified AD-associated SNPs in APOE and other genes, genetic information has not been integrated into an epidemiological framework for risk prediction. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using genotype data from 17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP Stage 1), we identified AD-associated SNPs (at p < 10-5). We then integrated these AD-associated SNPs into a Cox proportional hazard model using genotype data from a subset of 6,409 AD patients and 9,386 older controls from Phase 1 of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), providing a polygenic hazard score (PHS) for each participant. By combining population-based incidence rates and the genotype-derived PHS for each individual, we derived estimates of instantaneous risk for developing AD, based on genotype and age, and tested replication in multiple independent cohorts (ADGC Phase 2, National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Center [NIA ADC], and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], total n = 20,680). Within the ADGC Phase 1 cohort, individuals in the highest PHS quartile developed AD at a considerably lower age and had the highest yearly AD incidence rate. Among APOE epsilon3/3 individuals, the PHS modified expected age of AD onset by more than 10 y between the lowest and highest deciles (hazard ratio 3.34, 95% CI 2.62-4.24, p = 1.0 x 10-22). In independent cohorts, the PHS strongly predicted empirical age of AD onset (ADGC Phase 2, r = 0.90, p = 1.1 x 10-26) and longitudinal progression from normal aging to AD (NIA ADC, Cochran-Armitage trend test, p = 1.5 x 10-10), and was associated with neuropathology (NIA ADC, Braak stage of neurofibrillary tangles, p = 3.9 x 10-6, and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease score for neuritic plaques, p = 6.8 x 10-6) and in vivo markers of AD neurodegeneration (ADNI, volume loss within the entorhinal cortex, p = 6.3 x 10-6, and hippocampus, p = 7.9 x 10-5). Additional prospective validation of these results in non-US, non-white, and prospective community-based cohorts is necessary before clinical use. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a PHS for quantifying individual differences in age-specific genetic risk for AD. Within the cohorts studied here, polygenic architecture plays an important role in modifying AD risk beyond APOE. With thorough validation, quantification of inherited genetic variation may prove useful for stratifying AD risk and as an enrichment strategy in therapeutic trials.",

    "title": "Reference region selection and the association between the rate of amyloid accumulation over time and the baseline amyloid burden.",
    "abstract": "Relative quantitative analysis of amyloid plaque burden in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients can be reported as standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) from positron emission tomography (PET). Here, the SUVR is the ratio of the mean amyloid radioligand retention in a composite (COMP) neocortical volume of interest (VOI) to that in a reference VOI, such as the cerebellum, brainstem (BST)/pons, or white matter (WM). Some longitudinal PET investigations show that the rate of amyloid accumulation to follow-up has an inverted U relationship with baseline amyloid SUVR relative to cerebellar or brainstem/pons reference VOIs. The corresponding association with SUVR relative to WM is unknown. To test the possible benefits of WM normalization, we analyzed [18F]-AV45 PET data from 404 subjects in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database at baseline and 2-year follow-up (144 cognitively normal controls, 225 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 35 AD patients). Reference regions included subcortical WM as well as conventional cerebellar gray matter (CBL), and BST. We tested associations between each subject's inter-session change ( ) of SUVR and their baseline SUVR by applying linear, logarithmic, and quadratic regression analyses. Unscaled standardized uptake values (SUVs) were correlated between VOIs at baseline and follow-up, and within VOIs in the longitudinal run. The association between  SUVR and baseline SUVR relative to WM reference was best described by an inverted U-shaped function. Correlation analyses demonstrated a high regional and temporal correlation between COMP and WM VOI SUVs. For WM normalization, we confirm that the rate of amyloid accumulation over time follows an inverted U-shaped function of baseline amyloid burden. Reference region selection, however, has substantial effects on SUVR results. This reflects the extent of covariance between SUVs in the COMP VOI and those in the various reference VOIs. We speculate that PET labeling of amyloid deposition within target regions is partially confounded by effects of longitudinal changes of cerebral blood flow (CBF) on tracer delivery. Indeed, CBF may be the leading factor influencing longitudinal SUV changes. We suggest that SUVR relative to WM may be more robust to changes in CBF, and thus fitter for sensitive detection of amyloid accumulation in intervention studies.",

    "abstract": "See Vandenberghe and Schaeverbeke (doi:10.1093/awx065) for a scientific commentary on this article. A long-term goal of our field is to determine the sequence of pathological events, which ultimately lead to cognitive decline and dementia. In this study, we first assessed the patterns of brain tau tangle accumulation (measured with the positron emission tomography tracer 18F-AV-1451) associated with well-established Alzheimer's disease factors in a cohort including cognitively healthy elderly individuals and individuals at early symptomatic stages of Alzheimer's disease. We then explored highly associated patterns of greater 18F-AV-1451 binding and increased annualized change in cortical amyloid-beta plaques measured as florbetapir positron emission tomography binding antecedent to 18F-AV-1451 positron emission tomography scans, and to what extent these multimodal pattern associations explained the variance in cognitive performance and clinical outcome measures, independently and jointly. We found that: (i) 18F-AV-1451 positron emission tomography retention was differentially associated with age, and cross-sectional florbetapir positron emission tomography retention, but not with years of education, gender, or APOE genotype; (ii) increased annualized change in florbetapir retention, antecedent to 18F-AV-1451 positron emission tomography scans, in the parieto-temporal and precuneus brain regions was associated with greater 18F-AV-1451 PET retention most prominently in the inferior temporal and inferior parietal regions in the full cohort, with florbetapir positive/negative-associated variability; and (iii) this 18F-AV-1451 positron emission tomography retention pattern significantly explained the variance in cognitive performance and clinical outcome measures, independent of the associated antecedent increased annualized change in florbetapir positron emission tomography retention. These findings are in agreement with the pathology literature, which suggests that tau tangles but not amyloid-beta plaques correlate with cognition and clinical symptoms. Furthermore, non-local associations linking increased amyloid-beta accumulation rates with increased tau deposition are of great interest and support the idea that the amyloid-beta pathology might have remote effects in disease pathology spread potentially via the brain's intrinsic connectivity networks.",

    "title": "Knockdown of APPL mimics transgenic Abeta induced neurodegenerative phenotypes in Drosophila.",
    "abstract": "A variety of Drosophila mutant lines have been established as potential disease-models to study various disease mechanisms including human neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The evolutionary conservation of APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein) and APPL (Amyloid Precursor Protein-Like) and the comparable detrimental effects caused by their metabolic products strongly implies the conservation of their normal physiological functions. In view of this milieu, a comparative analysis on the pattern of neurodegenerative phenotypes between Drosophila APPL-RNAi line and transgenic Drosophila line expressing eye tissue specific human Abeta (Amyloid beta) was undertaken. Our results clearly show that Drosophila APPL-RNAi largely mimics transgenic Abeta in various phenotypes which include eye degeneration, reduced longevity and motor neuron deficit functions, etc. The ultra-structural morphological pattern of eye degeneration was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. Further, a comparative study on longevity and motor behaviour between Abeta expressing and APPL knockdown lines revealed similar kind of behavioural deficit and longevity phenotypes. Therefore, it is suggested that APPL-knockdown approach can be used as an alternative approach to study neurodegenerative diseases in the fly model. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report showing comparable phenotypes between APPL and Abeta in AD model of Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "We have investigated the free energy landscape of Abeta-peptide dimer models in connection to gas-phase FRET experiments. We use a FRET-related distance coordinate and one conformation-related coordinate per monomer for accelerated structural exploration with well-tempered metadynamics in solvent and in vacuo. The free energy profiles indicate that FRET under equilibrium conditions should be significantly affected by the de-solvation upon the transfer of ions to the gas-phase. In contrast, a change in the protonation state is found to be less impacting once de-solvated. Comparing F19P and WT alloforms, for which we measure different FRET efficiencies in the gas-phase, we predict only the relevant structural differences in the solution populations, not under gas-phase equilibrium conditions. This finding supports the hypothesis that the gas-phase action-FRET measurement after ESI operates under non-equilibrium conditions, with a memory of the solution conditions - even for the dimer of this relatively short peptide. The structural differences in solution are rationalized in terms of conformational propensities around residue 19, which show a transition to a poly-proline type of pattern upon mutation to F19P - a difference that gets lost in the gas-phase.",

Here, we report the characterization of the active species prepared under different conditions, describe which Abeta species is present in brain tissue during the behavioral recall time point and relate the sequence and structure of the oligomeric species to the resulting neuronal properties and effect on LTM. Our results suggest that oligomers are the key toxic Abeta1-42 structures, which likely affect LTM through synaptic plasticity pathways, and that Abeta 1-42 and Abeta 25-35 cannot be used as interchangeable peptides.",

    "abstract": "The behavior of a single Abeta40 molecule within a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer was studied by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The effect of membrane structure was investigated on Abeta40 behavior, secondary structure, and insertion depth. Simulations were performed at three temperatures (323, 310, and 300 K) to probe three different bilayer fluidities. Results show that at all above temperatures, the peptide contains two short helices, coil, bend, and turn structures. At 300 K, the peptide contains a region with beta structure in C-terminal region. Our results also show that Abeta decreases the bilayer thickness and the order of lipids in its vicinity which leads to water insertion into the bilayer and concomitant increase in the local fluidity. The peptide remains embedded in the bilayer at all temperatures, and become inserted into the bilayer up to several residues at 323 and 310 K. At 310 and 300 K, the dominant interaction energy between Abeta and bilayer changes from electrostatic to van der Waals. It can be proposed that at higher temperatures (e.g., 323 K), Lys28 and the C-terminal region of the peptide play the role of two anchors that keep Abeta inside the top leaflet. This study demonstrates that Abeta molecule can perturb the integrity of cellular membranes. Proteins 2017; 85:1298-1310.   2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "abstract": "Importance: Existing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or imaging (tau positron emission tomography) biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD) are invasive or expensive. Biomarkers based on standard blood test results would be useful in research, drug development, and clinical practice. Plasma neurofilament light (NFL) has recently been proposed as a blood-based biomarker for neurodegeneration in dementias. Objective: To test whether plasma NFL concentrations are increased in AD and associated with cognitive decline, other AD biomarkers, and imaging evidence of neurodegeneration. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective case-control study, an ultrasensitive assay was used to measure plasma NFL concentration in 193 cognitively healthy controls, 197 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 180 patients with AD dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The study dates were September 7, 2005, to February 13, 2012. The plasma NFL analysis was performed in September 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: Associations were tested between plasma NFL and diagnosis, Abeta pathologic features, CSF biomarkers of neuronal injury, cognition, brain structure, and metabolism. Results: Among 193 cognitively healthy controls, 197 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 180 patients with AD with dementia, plasma NFL correlated with CSF NFL (Spearman rho = 0.59, P < .001). Plasma NFL was increased in patients with MCI (mean, 42.8 ng/L) and patients with AD dementia (mean, 51.0 ng/L) compared with controls (mean, 34.7 ng/L) (P < .001) and had high diagnostic accuracy for patients with AD with dementia vs controls (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.87, which is comparable to established CSF biomarkers). Plasma NFL was particularly high in patients with MCI and patients with AD dementia with Abeta pathologic features. High plasma NFL correlated with poor cognition and AD-related atrophy (at baseline and longitudinally) and with brain hypometabolism (longitudinally). Conclusions and Relevance: Plasma NFL is associated with AD diagnosis and with cognitive, biochemical, and imaging hallmarks of the disease. This finding implies a potential usefulness for plasma NFL as a noninvasive biomarker in AD.",

    "abstract": "Non-amyloid cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) may be interrelated through the damaged basement membranes (BMs) and extracellular matrix changes of small vessels, resulting in a failure of beta-amyloid (Abeta) transport and degradation. We analyzed BM changes and the pattern of deposition of Abeta in the walls of blood vessels in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSP), a non-transgenic CSVD model. In 45 SHRSP and 38 Wistar rats aged 18 to 32 weeks: (i) the percentage area immunostained for vascular collagen IV and laminin was quantified; (ii) the capillary BM thickness as well as endothelial and pericyte pathological changes were analysed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM); and (iii) the presence of vascular Abeta was assessed. Compared with controls, SHRSP exhibited a significantly higher percentage area immunostained with collagen IV in the striatum and thalamus. SHRSP also revealed an age-dependent increase of the capillary BM thickness and of endothelial vacuoles (caveolae) within subcortical regions. Endogenous Abeta deposits in the walls of small blood vessels were observed in the cortex (with the highest incidence found within fronto-parietal areas), striatum, thalamus and hippocampus. Vascular beta-amyloid accumulations were frequently detected at sites of small vessel wall damage. Our data demonstrate changes in the expression of collagen IV and of the ultrastructure of BMs in the small vessels of SHRSP. Alterations are accompanied by vascular deposits of endogenous Abeta. Impaired beta-amyloid clearance along perivascular and endothelial pathways and failure of extracellular Abeta degradation may be the key mechanisms connecting non-amyloid CSVD and CAA.",

    "abstract": "Human-to-human transmission of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) has occurred through medical procedures resulting in iatrogenic CJD (iCJD). One of the commonest causes of iCJD was the use of human pituitary-derived growth hormone (hGH) to treat primary or secondary growth hormone deficiency. As part of a comprehensive tissue-based analysis of the largest cohort yet collected (35 cases) of UK hGH-iCJD cases, we describe the clinicopathological phenotype of hGH-iCJD in the UK. In the 33/35 hGH-iCJD cases with sufficient paraffin-embedded tissue for full pathological examination, we report the accumulation of the amyloid beta (Abeta) protein associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the brains and cerebral blood vessels in 18/33 hGH-iCJD patients and for the first time in 5/12 hGH recipients who died from causes other than CJD. Abeta accumulation was markedly less prevalent in age-matched patients who died from sporadic CJD and variant CJD. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Abeta, which can accumulate in the pituitary gland, was present in the inoculated hGH preparations and had a seeding effect in the brains of around 50% of all hGH recipients, producing an AD-like neuropathology and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), regardless of whether CJD neuropathology had occurred. These findings indicate that Abeta seeding can occur independently and in the absence of the abnormal prion protein in the human brain. Our findings provide further evidence for the prion-like seeding properties of Abeta and give insights into the possibility of iatrogenic transmission of AD and CAA.",

It has been known for some time that APP can regulate neuronal metabolism; however, the present review examines the evidence indicating that APP and its peptides can also regulate key metabolic processes such as insulin action, lipid synthesis and storage and mitochondrial function in peripheral tissues. This review presents the hypothesis that amyloidogenic processing of APP in peripheral tissues plays a key role in the response to nutrient excess and that this could contribute to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D).",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele located on chromosome 19 is a major genetic risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the direct effects of ApoE4 on the cognitive function and long-term synaptic plasticity have not fully investigated. At the same time, although amyloid beta protein (Abeta)-ApoE complexes are principal components of AD-associated brain damage, there is still lack of in vivo study on the effects of co-existed Abeta1-40 and ApoE4. In the present study, we examined the effects of ApoE4 on the spatial memory and hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) by using Morris water maze test and in vivo field potential recording, compared the neurotoxicity of Abeta1-40 and ApoE4, and investigated the effects of co-application of Abeta1-40 and ApoE4 on cognitive behavior and synaptic plasticity. The results showed that intracerebrovenrticular (i.c.v.) injection of Abeta1-40 or ApoE4 significantly and similarly impaired spatial learning and memory, and depressed the high-frequency stimulus (HFS) induced LTP. Importantly, compared to the effects of Abeta1-40 or ApoE4 alone, co-injection of Abeta1-40 and ApoE4 produced much heavier damages in cognitive behaviors and long term synaptic plasticity. These results demonstrated that ApoE4 not only exerted direct neurotoxicity but also enhanced the neurotoxicity of Abeta1-40 on spatial cognitive function and hippocampal LTP, which maybe partly elucidates the mechanism by which APOE4 allele exerted negative effects as a major genetic risk factor for developing AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increased beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) activity has consistently been detected in brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared with control subjects. The collection of cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture is invasive. We sought to identify the presence of plasma BACE1 activity and determine potential alterations in subjects with MCI with clinical follow-up examinations for 3 years using patients with diagnosed probable AD dementia compared with healthy control subjects. METHODS: Seventy-five patients with probable AD, 96 individuals with MCI, and 53 age-matched and sex-matched healthy control subjects were recruited from three independent international academic memory clinics and AD research expert centers. Plasma BACE1 activity was measured by a synthetic fluorescence substrate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. BACE1 protein expression was assessed by Western blotting using three different antibodies that recognize the epitopes of the N-terminus, C-terminus, and full-length BACE1. RESULTS: Compared with healthy control subjects, plasma BACE1 activity (Vmax) significantly increased by 53.2% in subjects with MCI and by 68.9% in patients with probable AD. Subjects with MCI who converted to probable AD dementia at follow-up examinations exhibited significantly higher BACE1 activity compared with cognitively stable MCI nonconverters and showed higher levels of BACE1 activity than patients with AD. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma BACE1 activity is significantly increased in MCI converters and patients with probable AD. The sensitivities and specificities of BACE1 activity for the patients were 84% and 88%, respectively. Our results indicate that plasma BACE1 activity may be a biomarker for AD risk and could predict progression from prodromal to probable AD dementia.",

    "abstract": "Neurogenesis impairment is considered a major determinant of the intellectual disability that characterizes Down syndrome (DS), a genetic condition caused by triplication of chromosome 21. Previous evidence obtained in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS showed that the triplicated gene APP (amyloid precursor protein) is critically involved in neurogenesis alterations. In particular, excessive levels of AICD (amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain) resulting from APP cleavage by gamma-secretase increase the transcription of Ptch1, a Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) receptor that keeps the mitogenic Shh pathway repressed. Previous evidence showed that neonatal treatment with ELND006, an inhibitor of gamma-secretase, reinstates the Shh pathway and fully restores neurogenesis in Ts65Dn pups. In the framework of potential therapies for DS, it is extremely important to establish whether the positive effects of early intervention are retained after treatment cessation. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to establish whether early treatment with ELND006 leaves an enduring trace in the brain of Ts65Dn mice. Ts65Dn and euploid pups were treated with ELND006 in the postnatal period P3-P15 and the outcome of treatment was examined at ~one month after treatment cessation. We found that in treated Ts65Dn mice the pool of proliferating cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and total number of granule neurons were still restored as was the number of pre- and postsynaptic terminals in the stratum lucidum of CA3, the site of termination of the mossy fibers from the DG. Accordingly, patch-clamp recording from field CA3 showed functional normalization of the input to CA3. Unlike in field CA3, the number of pre- and postsynaptic terminals in the DG of treated Ts65Dn mice was no longer fully restored. The finding that many of the positive effects of neonatal treatment were retained after treatment cessation provides proof of principle demonstration of the efficacy of early inhibition of gamma-secretase for the improvement of brain development in DS.",

    "abstract": "The progressive nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to occur, at least in part, by the self-replication and spreading of Abeta and Tau aggregates through a prion mechanism. Evidence now exists that structural variants of Abeta prions can propagate their distinct conformations through template-directed folding of naive Abeta peptides. This notion implicates that the first self-propagating Abeta assembly to emerge in the brain dictates the conformation, anatomical spread and pace of subsequently formed deposits. It is hypothesized that a prion mechanism defines the molecular basis underlying the diverse clinicopathologic phenotypes observed across the spectrum of AD patients. Thus, distinct AD strains might require further sub-classification based on biochemical and structural characterization of aggregated Abeta. Here, we review the evidence for distinct, self-propagating Abeta strains, and discuss potential cellular mechanisms that might contribute to their manifestation. From this perspective, we also explore the implications of Abeta strains for current FDA-approved medical imaging probes and therapies for amyloid. Ultimately, the discovery of new molecular tools to differentiate Abeta strains and dissect the heterogeneity of AD may lead to the development of more informative diagnostics and strain-specific therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether activation of the liver X receptors (LXRs) inhibits amyloid beta1-40 (Abeta1-40) induced inflammatory and senescent responses in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Confluent cultures of human primary RPE and ARPE-19 cells pretreated with 5 muMu of TO901317 (TO90), a synthetic agonist of LXR, or vehicle were incubated with 1 muMu of Abeta1-40 or Abeta40-1. The optimum concentrations of Abeta1-40 and TO90 were determined by cell viability assay. Pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Expression and localization of an aging protein p16INK4a (p16) were analyzed by western blotting and immunofluorescence. Expressions of LXRs and one of their target genes ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) were examined by real-time PCR and western blotting. Phosphorylated transcription inhibition factor-kappaB-alpha (p-IkappaB-alpha) was assessed by western blotting. RESULTS: A negative linear relationship between the Abeta1-40 concentration and the cell viability was evident, indicating Abeta1-40 decreased ARPE-19 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Abeta1-40 enhanced the expression of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 as well as p16 in both RPE cell lines at both mRNA and protein levels, whereas TO90 counteracted the detrimental effects. TO90 upregulated the expression of LXRalpha and its target gene ABCA1, but it did not affect the expression of LXRbeta. Meanwhile, TO90 inhibited the phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha mediated by Abeta1-40 stimulation. CONCLUSION: Activation of the LXRalpha-ABCA1 axis may alleviate Abeta1-40 induced inflammatory and senescent responses in RPE cells. The beneficial effect appears associated with the inhibition of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway.",

    "title": "High affinity binding of amyloid beta-peptide to calmodulin: Structural and functional implications.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta) are a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their neurotoxicity develop with cytosolic calcium dysregulation. On the other hand, calmodulin (CaM), a protein which plays a major multifunctional role in neuronal calcium signaling, has been shown to be involved in the regulation of non-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid beta precursor protein (APP). Using fluorescent 6-bromoacetyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene derivatives of CaM, Badan-CaM, and human amyloid beta(1-42) HiLyte -Fluor555, we show in this work that Abeta binds with high affinity to CaM through the neurotoxic Abeta25-35 domain. In addition, the affinity of Abeta for calcium-saturated CaM conformation is approximately 20-fold higher than for CaM conformation in the absence of calcium (apo-CaM). Moreover, the value of Kd of 0.98 +- 0.11 nM obtained for Abeta1-42 dissociation from CaM saturated by calcium points out that CaM is one of the cellular targets with highest affinity for neurotoxic Abeta peptides. A major functional consequence of Abeta-CaM interaction is that it slowdowns Abeta fibrillation. The novel and high affinity interaction between calmodulin and Abeta shown in this work opens a yet-unexplored gateway to further understand the neurotoxic effect of Abeta in different neural cells and also to address the potential of calmodulin and calmodulin-derived peptides as therapeutic agents in AD.",

METHODS: Positive florbetapir positron emission tomography scans were analyzed from participants (66 placebo treated and 63 solanezumab treated) with mild dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease from the EXPEDITION and EXPEDITION2 studies. For comparison to CBL, a second normalization was performed on longitudinal data using an SSWM correction factor (SSWM normalization ratio [SSWMnr]). Analysis of covariance assessed baseline to 18-month change between treatment with solanezumab and placebo. Sample and effect size estimations provided magnitude of observed treatment changes. RESULTS: Longitudinal percent change between placebo and solanezumab using CBL was not significant (P = .536) but was significant for SSWMnr (P = .042). Compared with CBL, SSWMnr technique increased the power to detect a treatment difference, more than tripling the effect size and reducing the sample size requirements by 85% to 90%. DISCUSSION: Adjusting longitudinal standardized uptake value ratios with an SSWM reference region in these antiamyloid treatment trials increased mean change detection and decreased variance resulting in the substantial improvement in statistical power to detect change.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Stress response is determined by the brain, and the brain is a sensitive target for stress. Our previous experiments have confirmed that once the stress response is beyond the tolerable limit of the brain, particularly that of the hippocampus, it will have deleterious effects on hippocampal structure and function; however, the metabolic mechanisms for this are not well understood. METHODS: Here, we used morris water maze, elisa and gas chromatography-time of flight/mass spectrometry to observe the changes in cognition, neuropathology and metabolomics in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and wild-type (C57) mice caused by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), we also further explored the correlation between cognition and metabolomics. RESULTS: We found that 4 weeks of CUMS aggravated cognitive impairment and increased amyloid-beta deposition in APP/PS1 mice, but did not affect C57 mice. Under non-stress conditions, compared with C57 mice, there were 8 different metabolites in APP/PS1 mice. However, following CUMS, 3 different metabolites were changed compared with untreated C57 mice. Compared to APP/PS1 mice, there were 7 different metabolites in APP/PS1+CUMS mice. Among these alterations, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, valine, serine, beta-alanine and o-phosphorylethanolamine, which are involved in sphingolipid metabolism, synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, and amino acid metabolism. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that APP/PS1 mice are more vulnerable to stress than C57 mice, and the metabolic mechanisms of stress-related cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice are related to multiple pathways and networks, including sphingolipid metabolism, synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, and amino acid metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The Eph-ephrin system plays pivotal roles in cell adhesion and migration. The receptor-like functions of the ephrin ligands allow the regulation of intracellular processes via reverse signaling. gamma-Secretase mediated processing of ephrin-B has previously been linked to activation of Src, a kinase crucial for focal adhesion and podosome phosphorylation. Here, we analyzed the role of gamma-secretase in the stimulation of reverse ephrin-B2 signaling in the migration of mouse embryonic stem cell derived microglia. The proteolytic generation of the ephrin-B2 intracellular domain (ICD) by gamma-secretase stimulates Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Inhibition of gamma-secretase decreased the phosphorylation of Src and FAK, and reduced cell motility. These effects were associated with enlargement of the podosomal surface. Interestingly, expression of ephrin-B2 ICD could rescue these effects, indicating that this proteolytic fragment mediates the activation of Src and FAK, and thereby regulates podosomal dynamics in microglial cells. Together, these results identify gamma-secretase as well as ephrin-B2 as regulators of microglial migration.",

    "title": "Modulation effect of acidulated human serum albumin on Cu2+-mediated amyloid beta-protein aggregation and cytotoxicity under a mildly acidic condition.",
    "abstract": "Aggregation of amyloid beta-proteins (Abeta) induced by Cu2+ is a crucial element in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cerebral acidosis is a common complication of AD. Under mildly acidic conditions, Cu2+-Abeta species have higher tendency to generate neurotoxic aggregates. Hence it is of significance to develop potent agents that inhibit Cu2+-mediated Abeta aggregation under a mildly acidic condition. Herein we synthesized acidulated human serum albumin (A-HSA) to mitigate Cu2+-mediated Abeta42 aggregation and cytotoxicity at pH6.6. Extensive experiments showed that A-HSA altered the pathway of Cu2+-mediated Abeta42 aggregation and protected SH-SY5Y cells from cytotoxicity and oxidative damage induced by Cu2+-Abeta42 species. Equimolar A-HSA increased cell viability from 52% to 91% as compared to Cu2+-Abeta42-treated group. Stopped-flow fluorescence analysis revealed that A-HSA changed the Cu2+-Abeta42 coordination mode from component I to II on the second timescale at pH6.6, which avoided the formation of aggregation-prone Cu2+-Abeta42 aggregates. The findings revealed that the more negative charges on A-HSA surface could stabilize the protonated form of the adjacent histidine residues of Abeta42. Hence, component I, which is necessary to form toxic aggregates, became unstable in the presence of A-HSA. On the other hand, hydrophobic binding and electrostatic repulsion could work simultaneously on the bound Abeta42 on A-HSA surface. The two opposite forces stretched Abeta42 conformations, which inhibited the formation of toxic Cu2+-Abeta42 aggregates. Thus, A-HSA worked as a bifunctional inhibitor against Cu2+-mediated Abeta42 aggregation and cytotoxicity under a mildly acidic condition.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in neuronal dysfunction and death of Alzheimer's disease (AD). ApoE4 is a major risk factor of AD, while ApoE2 is neuroprotective. Little is known about the roles of ApoE isoforms in the neuroinflammation seen in AD. Their roles and mechanisms in Abeta-induced/neuroinflammation were investigated in this study using in vivo and in vitro models. Rat astrocytes were treated with lipid-poor recombinant hApoE and/or Abeta42. Mouse astrocyte lines-expressing lipidated hApoE were treated with Abeta42 and/or vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonist, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Cells and media were harvested for cytokine ELISA, RNA isolated for qRT-PCR, and nuclear protein for transcription factor (TF) arrays and EMSA. hApoE-transgenic and AD mice were mated to generate hApoE2/AD and hApoE4/AD mice. Mice were euthanized at 6 months of age. Brain tissues were collected for cytokine ELISA array, Abeta ELISA, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. hApoE4/AD mice had significantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines than hApoE2/AD mice. Lipidated hApoE4 significantly promoted inflammatory gene expression induced by Abeta42 but not recombinant hApoE4 in astrocytes as compared to controls. Lipidated hApoE3 provided a certain degree of protection against Abeta42-induced inflammatory response but not recombinant hApoE3 as compared to controls. Both lipidated and recombinant hApoE2 provided protection against Abeta42-induced inflammatory response compared to controls. TF array revealed that ApoE2 strongly activated VDR in Abeta42-treated astrocytes. Application of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 completely inhibited Abeta-induced inflammatory gene expression in hApoE4-expressing astrocytes. The results suggest that ApoE4 promotes, but ApoE2 inhibits, AD/Abeta-induced neuroinflammation via VDR signaling. Targeting VDR signaling or active form of VD3 may relieve AD neuroinflammation or/and neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Oligomeric forms of amyloid-beta (Abeta), tau, and TDP-43 play important roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and therefore are promising biomarkers. We previously generated single chain antibody fragments (scFvs) that selectively bind disease-related variants of these proteins including A4, C6T, and E1, which bind different oligomeric Abeta variants; D11C, which binds oligomeric tau; and AD-TDP1 and AD-TDP2, which bind disease related TDP-43 variants. To determine the utility of these disease-related variants as early biomarkers, we first analyzed 11 human sera samples obtained ~2 years prior to an initial mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis. While the subsequent diagnoses for the cases covered several different conditions, all samples had elevated protein variant levels relative to the plasma controls although with different individual biomarker profiles. We then analyzed a set of longitudinal human plasma samples from four AD (encompassing time points prior to MCI diagnosis and continuing until after conversion to AD) and two control cases. Pre-MCI samples were characterized by high TDP-43 variant levels, MCI samples by high Abeta variant levels, and AD samples by high Abeta and tau variant levels. Sample time points ranged from ~7 years pre-MCI to ~9 years after AD conversion. Bivariate correlations showed a negative correlation with TDP-43 levels and positive correlations with cumulative Abeta and oligomeric tau levels indicating an increase in neurodegenerative processes with time in AD. Detection of disease related protein variants not only readily selects AD cases from controls, but also stages progression of AD and holds promise for a pre-symptomatic blood-based biomarker profile for AD.",

    "abstract": "We recently demonstrated that soluble forms of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (sAbetaPP) assemble into multimeric complexes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which contributes to the underestimation of specific sAbetaPP species when assessed by ELISA. To circumvent this issue, we analyzed by SDS-PAGE large fragments of sAbetaPP and their variants in the CSF from Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 20) and control (n = 20) subjects, probing with specific antibodies against particular domains. Similar levels of sAbetaPPalpha and sAbetaPPbeta protein were found in CSF samples from AD and controls, yet there appeared to be a shift in the balance of the soluble full-length AbetaPP (sAbetaPPf) species in AD samples, with a decrease in the proportion of the lower (~100 kDa) band relative to the upper (~120 kDa) band. Similar differences were observed in the contribution of the major KPI-immunoreactive AbetaPP species. CSF samples also displayed differences in the correlations of AbetaPP species with classical AD biomarkers, particularly with respect to the Abeta42 peptide. The differences reveal alterations that probably reflect pathophysiological changes in the brain.",

    "title": "GluA1 subunit ubiquitination mediates amyloid-beta-induced loss of surface alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors.",
    "abstract": "The accumulation of soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides produces profound neuronal changes in the brain during the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Excessive levels of Abeta disrupt excitatory synaptic transmission by promoting the removal of synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs), dendritic spine loss, and synaptic depression. Recently, activity-dependent ubiquitination of the GluA1 subunit has been shown to regulate the intracellular sorting of AMPARs toward late endosomes for degradation. However, whether this ubiquitin signaling pathway mediates Abeta-induced loss of surface AMPARs is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that acute exposure of cultured neurons to soluble Abeta oligomers induces AMPAR ubiquitination concomitant with the removal of AMPARs from the plasma membrane. Importantly, expression of the GluA1 ubiquitin-deficient mutants inhibited the adverse effects of Abeta on the surface expression of AMPARs in neurons. Furthermore, we revealed the cross-talk between GluA1 ubiquitination and phosphorylation, in particular phosphorylation at Ser-845, which is crucial for AMPAR recycling and is known to be dephosphorylated in the presence of Abeta. Our data showed that the GluA1 ubiquitin-deficient mutant enhances GluA1 phosphorylation on Ser-845. Conversely, the GluA1 S845D phosphomimetic mutant reduced binding with Nedd4-1 and hence the ubiquitination of AMPARs. Importantly, the GluA1 S845D mutant also prevented Abeta-induced removal of surface AMPARs. Taken together, these findings provide the first demonstration of the dynamic cross-modulation of GluA1 ubiquitination and phosphorylation, a process that is perturbed by Abeta, in regulating the membrane sorting decision that ultimately determines the number of AMPARs on the cell surface.",

    "title": "Kinetic Insights into Zn2+-Induced Amyloid beta-Protein Aggregation Revealed by Stopped-Flow Fluorescence Spectroscopy.",
    "abstract": "Zn2+ has remarkable impacts on amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) aggregation, which is crucial in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. However, the Zn2+ concentration in human cerebrospinal fluid is commonly too low for interaction with Abeta, and only during neurotransmission is there a transient release of a high concentration of Zn2+. It is difficult to explore the details of the interaction between Zn2+ and Abeta within such a short time scale by using ordinary analytical methods. Herein, stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy was used to study the fast aggregation kinetics of Abeta42 in the presence of Zn2+ in the time scale from 1 ms to seconds. It was found that Zn2+ bound to Abeta42 within 1 ms; caused immediate conformational transition around Tyr10, which led to the enhancement of Abeta42 hydrophobicity; and then promoted fast aggregation of Abeta42 through enhanced hydrophobic interactions. Among the two Zn2+-binding sites on Abeta42 (KD = 107 nM and 5.2 muM), the first one of higher affinity had a greater impact on the aggregation of Abeta42. Three kinetic phases were observed in the Zn2+-induced fast aggregation of Abeta42, and the fast phase was extremely accelerated by Zn2+, indicating that accelerated aggregation mainly occurred in the fast phase. The reactions occurring in this phase were closely related to the association of Zn2+ and Abeta42. Moreover, Zn2+ largely broadened the pH range of Abeta42 fast aggregation from pH 5.2-6.2 without Zn2+ to pH 5.2-7.8 in the presence of Zn2+. Besides, the promoting effect of Zn2+ on Abeta42 fast aggregation peaked at pH 6.8-7.8, which includes the pH values of the cerebrospinal fluid (pH 7.3) and hippocampus (pH 7.15-7.35). The findings demonstrate the significant effect of Zn2+ on Abeta aggregation and provide new insight into its mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, and is characterized by extracellular deposition of beta-amyloid and intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the brain. These pathologic findings are identified postmortem. Various visual deficits in AD have been reported and there have been conflicting reports, through imaging and pathology studies, regarding the presence of changes in the globe that mirror Alzheimer changes in the brain. Moreover, both macular degeneration and glaucoma have been variously characterized as having AD-related features. We examined one or both eyes from 19 autopsy cases, 17 of which had varying degrees of AD-related changes, and 2 of which were age-matched controls. Three cases had glaucoma and 4 had macular degeneration. Immunohistochemistry for tau, beta-amyloid, TDP-43, ubiquitin, and alpha-synuclein showed no evidence of inclusions, deposits or other protein accumulation in any case, in any part of the globe. This finding suggests that regardless of the severity of changes seen in the brain in AD, there are no similar changes in the globe.",

    "abstract": "Ghrelin is a metabolic hormone that has neuroprotective actions in a number of neurological conditions, including Parkinson's disease (PD), stroke and traumatic brain injury. Acyl ghrelin treatment in vivo and in vitro also shows protective capacity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we used ghrelin knockout (KO) and their wild-type littermates to test whether or not endogenous ghrelin is protective in a mouse model of AD, in which human amyloid beta peptide 1-40 (Abeta1-40 ) was injected into the lateral ventricles i.c.v. Recognition memory, using the novel object recognition task, was significantly impaired in ghrelin KO mice and after i.c.v. Abeta1-40 treatment. These deficits could be prevented by acyl ghrelin injections for 7 days. Spatial orientation, as assessed by the Y-maze task, was also significantly impaired in ghrelin KO mice and after i.c.v. Abeta1-40 treatment. These deficits could be prevented by acyl ghrelin injections for 7 days. Ghrelin KO mice had deficits in olfactory discrimination; however, neither i.c.v. Abeta1-40 treatment, nor acyl ghrelin injections affected olfactory discrimination. We used stereology to show that ghrelin KO and Abeta1-40 increased the total number of glial fibrillary acidic protein expressing astrocytes and ionised calcium-binding adapter expressing microglial in the rostral hippocampus. Finally, Abeta1-40 blocked long-term potentiation induced by high-frequency stimulation and this effect could be acutely blocked with co-administration of acyl ghrelin. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that ghrelin deletion affects memory performance and also that acyl ghrelin treatment may delay the onset of early events of AD. This supports the idea that acyl ghrelin treatment may be therapeutically beneficial with respect to restricting disease progression in AD.",

    "abstract": "We fractionated frontal cortical grey matter from human Alzheimer's disease and control subjects into four biochemically defined pools that represent four distinct compartments: soluble/cytosolic, peripheral membrane/vesicular cargo, integral lipid/membranous pools and aggregated/insoluble debris. Most of the readily extractable amyloid-beta remains associated with a lipid/membranous compartment. There is an exchange of amyloid-beta between the biochemical pools that was lost for the amyloid-beta42 species in Alzheimer's disease, consistent with the peptide being irreversibly trapped in extracellular deposits. The quantitative amyloid-beta data, combined with magnetic resonance imaging volumetric analysis of the amount of cortical grey matter in brain, allowed us to estimate the total mass of amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's disease (6.5 mg) and control (1.7 mg) brains. The threshold positron emission tomography standard uptake value ratio of 1.4 equates to 5.0 mug amyloid-beta/g of grey matter and the mean Alzheimer's disease dementia standard uptake value ratio level of 2.3 equates to 11.20 mug amyloid-beta/g of grey matter. It takes 19 years to accumulate amyloid from the threshold positron emission tomography standard uptake value ratio to the mean value observed for Alzheimer's disease dementia. This accumulation time window combined with the difference of 4.8 mg of amyloid-beta between Alzheimer's disease and control brain allows for a first approximation of amyloid-beta accumulation of 28 ng/h. This equates to an estimated 2-5% of the total amyloid-beta production being deposited as insoluble plaques. Understanding these rates of amyloid-beta accumulation allows for a more quantitative approach in targeting the failure of amyloid-beta clearance in sporadic Alzheimer's disease.",

However, there are no studies of PiB binding across the lifespan in DS. The current study describes in vitro 3H-PiB binding in the frontal cortex of autopsy cases with DS compared to non-DS controls. Tissue from 64 cases included controls (n = 25) and DS (n = 39). In DS, 3H-PiB binding was significantly associated with age. After age 40 years in DS, 3H-PiB binding rose dramatically along with increasing individual variability. 3H-PiB binding correlated with the amount of Abeta42. Using fixed frontal tissue and fluorescent 6-CN-PiB, neuritic and cored plaques along with extensive cerebral amyloid angiopathy showed 6-CN-PiB binding. These results suggest that cortical PiB binding as shown by positron emission tomography imaging reflects plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in DS brain.",

    "abstract": "To date, neither any effective treatment nor prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a major dementia causing disorder, are available. Herein, we investigated the secondary prevention of neurodegeneration, amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau pathologies with a neurotrophic compound P021 in 3xTg-AD mice. Previous work found that P021 can rescue at mild to moderate stages Abeta and tau pathologies in 3xTg-AD mice. To determine its potential clinical application, we sought to test the preventive effect of P021 on Abeta and tau pathologies by starting the treatment during the period of synaptic compensation several months before the appearance of any overt pathology in 3xTg-AD mice. We started a continuous treatment with P021 in 3-month-old female animals and followed its effect at 9-, 15- and 18-months post-treatment. Neurodegeneration at the above time points was studied using Fluorojade C staining, and tau and Abeta pathologies both immunohistochemically and by Western blots. Cognitive performance was studied by assessing episodic memory with Novel Object Recognition task at 16-17-months post-treatment. We found that P021 treatment initiated during the synaptic compensation period can prevent neurodegeneration, Abeta and tau pathologies, rescue episodic memory impairment, and markedly reduce mortality rate. These findings for the first time show effective prevention of AD changes with a neurotrophic compound that targets neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, suggesting that improving the health of the neuronal network can prevent AD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of netrin-1 (NT-1) on amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced impairments in learning-memory and synaptic plasticity. The NT-1 or its vehicle was administered four times into the Abeta+NT or Abeta+V groups, respectively. The Abeta+SNT group received a single dose of NT-1. The Abeta+HNT group received heat-inactivated NT-1. For the learning-memory and synaptic plasticity assessment, field potentials recording and behavioral experiment were used. Bilateral injection of Abeta1-42 inhibits induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and decreased memory performance in all the behavioral tasks. However, only by repeated injection of NT-1, significant recovery of LTP and memory was seen. Although, the delivery of HFS to Abeta+NT group recovered EPSP slope of the maintenance phase when compared with Abeta+V, but it failed to recover the induction phase. It can be assumed that NT-1 may have regulatory effects on the synthesis of key proteins and/or structural changes that are responsible for LTP induction, since the protein synthesis and/or structural changes are required for the maintenance phase of LTP.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers are synaptotoxic, inappropriately increasing extracellular glutamate concentration and glutamate receptor activation to thereby rapidly disrupt synaptic plasticity. Thus, acutely promoting brain glutamate homeostasis with a blood-based scavenging system, glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), and blocking metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu5) receptor or its co-receptor cellular prion protein (PrP), prevent the acute inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) by exogenous Abeta. Here, we evaluated the time course of the effects of such interventions in the persistent disruptive effects of Abeta oligomers, either exogenously injected in wild type rats or endogenously generated in transgenic rats that model Alzheimer's disease amyloidosis. We report that repeated, but not acute, systemic administration of recombinant GOT type 1, with or without the glutamate co-substrate oxaloacetate, reversed the persistent deleterious effect of exogenous Abeta on synaptic plasticity. Moreover, similar repetitive treatment reversibly abrogated the inhibition of LTP monitored longitudinally in freely behaving transgenic rats. Remarkably, brief repeated treatment with an mGlu5 receptor antagonist, basimglurant, or an antibody that prevents Abeta oligomer binding to PrP, ICSM35, also had similar reversible ameliorative effects in the transgenic rat model. Overall, the present findings support the ongoing development of therapeutics for early Alzheimer's disease based on these complementary approaches.",

    "title": "Oleocanthal ameliorates amyloid-beta oligomers' toxicity on astrocytes and neuronal cells: In vitro studies.",
    "abstract": "Extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) has several health promoting effects. Evidence have shown that EVOO attenuates the pathology of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and improves cognitive function in experimental animal models, suggesting it's potential to protect and reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Available studies have linked this beneficial effect to oleocanthal, one of the active components in EVOO. The effect of oleocanthal against AD pathology has been linked to its ability to attenuate Abeta and tau aggregation in vitro, and enhance Abeta clearance from the brains of wild-type and AD transgenic mice in vivo. However, the ability of oleocanthal to alter the toxic effect of Abeta on brain parenchymal cells is unknown. In the current study, we investigated oleocanthal effect on modulating Abeta oligomers (Abetao) pathological events in neurons and astrocytes. Our findings demonstrated oleocanthal prevented Abetao-induced synaptic proteins, SNAP-25 and PSD-95, down-regulation in neurons, and attenuated Abetao-induced inflammation, glutamine transporter (GLT1) and glucose transporter (GLUT1) down-regulation in astrocytes. Abetao-induced inflammation was characterized by interleukin-6 (IL-6) increase and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) upregulation that were reduced by oleocanthal. In conclusion, this study provides further evidence to support the protective effect of EVOO-derived phenolic secoiridoid oleocanthal against AD pathology.",

This review aims to provide a conceptual instruction manual, covering appropriate considerations and pitfalls related to the use of ThT. We start by giving a brief introduction to amyloid formation with focus on the morphology of different aggregate species, followed by a discussion of the quality of protein needed to obtain reliable fibrillation data.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Flortaucipir (tau) positron emission tomography (PET) binding distinguishes individuals with clinically well-established posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) due to Alzheimer disease (AD) from cognitively normal (CN) controls. However, it is not known whether tau-PET binding patterns differentiate individuals with PCA from those with amnestic AD, particularly early in the symptomatic stages of disease. METHODS: Flortaucipir and florbetapir (beta-amyloid) PET imaging were performed in individuals with early-stage PCA (N=5), amnestic AD dementia (N=22), and CN controls (N=47). Average tau and beta-amyloid deposition were quantified using standard uptake value ratios and compared at a voxelwise level, controlling for age. RESULTS: PCA patients [median age-at-onset, 59 (51 to 61) years] were younger at symptom onset than similarly staged individuals with amnestic AD [75 (60 to 85) years] or CN controls [73 (61 to 90) years; P=0.002]. Flortaucipir uptake was higher in individuals with early-stage symptomatic PCA versus those with early-stage amnestic AD or CN controls, and greatest in posterior regions. Regional elevations in florbetapir were observed in areas of greatest tau deposition in PCA patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Flortaucipir uptake distinguished individuals with PCA and amnestic AD dementia early in the symptomatic course. The posterior brain regions appear to be uniquely vulnerable to tau deposition in PCA, aligning with clinical deficits that define this disease subtype.",

    "abstract": "Progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in the brain is implicated as the central event in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is thought that extracellular Abeta triggers toxic signals leading to neurodegeneration. The events downstream of Abeta however are not entirely clear. Clusterin (Apo J) is one of the major risk factors for sporadic form of AD. Clusterin binds to Abeta and prevents Abeta aggregation. In addition, clusterin promotes Abeta degradation and accelerates Abeta clearance from the brain. Clusterin thus protects neurons from Abeta and loss of clusterin level in the brain is implicated as promoting AD pathology. In this study, we found that the level of clusterin protein but not mRNA is reduced in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice. When rat hippocampal primary neurons were treated with Abeta1-42, level of clusterin protein but not mRNA was downregulated. Abeta1-42-induced downregulation of clusterin was blocked by lysosome inhibitors bafilomycin A1 and ammonium chloride. In neurons, Abeta1-42 induced expression of sortilin, a lysosomal sorting protein that targets proteins to lysosome for degradation. In BE(2) M17 human neuroblastoma cells, clusterin bound to sortilin and when sortilin expression was silenced, Abeta1-42-induced clusterin downregulation was almost completely blocked. Our data demonstrate that in neurons, Abeta1-42 promotes lysosomal degradation of clusterin by inducing expression of sortilin and provide a novel mechanism by which Abeta promotes AD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Transplantation of human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAM-MSCs) seems to be a promising strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the clinical therapeutic effects of hAM-MSCs and their mechanisms of action in AD remain to be determined. Here, we used amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin1 (PS1) double-transgenic mice to evaluate the effects of hAM-MSC transplantation on AD-related neuropathology and cognitive dysfunction. We found that hAM-MSC transplantation into the hippocampus dramatically reduced amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposition and rescued spatial learning and memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice. Interestingly, these effects were associated with increasing in Abeta-degrading factors, elevations in activated microglia, and the modulation of neuroinflammation. Furthermore, enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) and enhanced synaptic plasticity following hAM-MSC treatment could be another important factor in reversing the cognitive decline in APP/PS1 mice. Instead, the mechanism underlying the improved cognition apparently involves a robust increase in hippocampal synaptic density and neurogenesis that is mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In conclusion, our data suggest that hAM-MSCs may be a new and effective therapy for the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Importance: Midlife vascular risk factors have been associated with late-life dementia. Whether these risk factors directly contribute to brain amyloid deposition is less well understood. Objective: To determine if midlife vascular risk factors are associated with late-life brain amyloid deposition, measured using florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET). Design, Setting, and Participants: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)-PET Amyloid Imaging Study, a prospective cohort study among 346 participants without dementia in 3 US communities (Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; and Jackson, Mississippi) who have been evaluated for vascular risk factors and markers since 1987-1989 with florbetapir PET scans in 2011-2013. Positron emission tomography image analysis was completed in 2015. Exposures: Vascular risk factors at ARIC baseline (age 45-64 years; risk factors included body mass index >=30, current smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and total cholesterol >=200 mg/dL) were evaluated in multivariable models including age, sex, race, APOE genotype, and educational level. Main Outcomes and Measures: Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated from PET scans and a mean global cortical SUVR was calculated. Elevated florbetapir (defined as a SUVR >1.2) was the dependent variable. Results: Among 322 participants without dementia and with nonmissing midlife vascular risk factors at baseline (mean age, 52 years; 58% female; 43% black), the SUVR (elevated in 164 [50.9%] participants) was measured more than 20 years later (median follow-up, 23.5 years; interquartile range, 23.0-24.3 years) when participants were between 67 and 88 (mean, 76) years old. Elevated body mass index in midlife was associated with elevated SUVR (odds ratio [OR], 2.06; 95% CI, 1.16-3.65). At baseline, 65 participants had no vascular risk factors, 123 had 1, and 134 had 2 or more; a higher number of midlife risk factors was associated with elevated amyloid SUVR at follow-up (30.8% [n = 20], 50.4% [n = 62], and 61.2% [n = 82], respectively). In adjusted models, compared with 0 midlife vascular risk factors, the OR for elevated SUVR associated with 1 vascular risk factor was 1.88 (95% CI, 0.95-3.72) and for 2 or more vascular risk factors was 2.88 (95% CI, 1.46-5.69). No significant race x risk factor interactions were found. Late-life vascular risk factors were not associated with late-life brain amyloid deposition (for >=2 late-life vascular risk factors vs 0: OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 0.75-3.69). Conclusions and Relevance: An increasing number of midlife vascular risk factors was significantly associated with elevated amyloid SUVR; this association was not significant for late-life risk factors. These findings are consistent with a role of vascular disease in the development of Alzheimer disease.",

    "title": "The SNK and SPAR signaling pathway changes in hippocampal neurons treated with amyloid-beta peptide in vitro.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) is believed to be a primary cause of Alzheimer's disease. Many studies have demonstrated that Abeta causes morphological and functional alterations of dendritic spines, leading to synaptic dysfunction, but the effect of Abeta on damage to synaptic functions is not fully understood. Spine-associated Rap guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein (SPAR) is an important regulator of activity-dependent remodeling of synapses and is critically involved in both mature dendritic spine formation and the maintenance of spine maturity. Serum-inducible kinase (SNK) is an activity-inducible member of the polo-like family of serine/threonine kinases. Coordinated regulation of Ras and Rap by SNK is critical for homeostatic plasticity and memory. A previous study in which rats were injected with Abeta1-40 into the hippocampus showed that the SNK and SPAR signaling pathway may play a crucial role in Abeta-induced excitotoxic damage in the central nervous system by regulating synaptic stability. The present study was designed to investigate whether the SNK and SPAR signaling pathway was involved in Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in rat primary neurons. We measured mRNA and protein expression levels of SNK and SPAR in primary hippocampal neurons following Abeta treatment and used RNA interference to knockdown SNK to investigate the underlying mechanism. Expression of SNK and SPAR was altered by Abeta treatment, indicating that the SNK and SPAR signaling pathways may be involved in the damage to dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons induced by Abeta.",

    "abstract": "Water is essential for protein folding and assembly of amyloid fibrils. Internal water cavities have been proposed for several amyloid fibrils, but no direct structural and dynamical data have been reported on the water dynamics and site-specific interactions of water with the fibrils. Here we use solid-state NMR spectroscopy to investigate the water interactions of several Abeta40 fibrils. 1H spectral lineshapes, T2 relaxation times, and two-dimensional (2D) 1H-13C correlation spectra show that there are five distinct water pools: three are peptide-bound water, while two are highly dynamic water that can be assigned to interfibrillar water and bulk-like matrix water. All these water pools are associated with the fibrils on the nanometer scale. Water-transferred 2D correlation spectra allow us to map out residue-specific hydration and give evidence for the presence of a water pore in the center of the three-fold symmetric wild-type Abeta40 fibril. In comparison, the loop residues and the intramolecular strand-strand interface have low hydration, excluding the presence of significant water cavities in these regions. The Osaka Abeta40 mutant shows lower hydration and more immobilized water than wild-type Abeta40, indicating the influence of peptide structure on the dynamics and distribution of hydration water. Finally, the highly mobile interfibrillar and matrix water exchange with each other on the time scale of seconds, suggesting that fibril bundling separates these two water pools, and water molecules must diffuse along the fibril axis before exchanging between these two environments. These results provide insights and experimental constraints on the spatial distribution and dynamics of water pools in these amyloid fibrils.",

    "abstract": "The purpose our study was to determine the protective effects of mitochondria division inhibitor 1 (Mdivi1) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Mdivi1 is hypothesized to reduce excessive fragmentation of mitochondria and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD neurons. Very little is known about whether Mdivi1 can confer protective effects in AD. In the present study, we sought to determine the protective effects of Mdivi1 against amyloid-beta (Abeta)- and mitochondrial fission protein, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-induced excessive fragmentation of mitochondria in AD progression. We also studied preventive (Mdivi1+Abeta42) and intervention (Abeta42+Mdivi1) effects against Abeta42 in N2a cells. Using real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting analysis, we measured mRNA and protein levels of mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial biogenesis, and synaptic genes. We also assessed mitochondrial function by measuring H2O2, lipid peroxidation, cytochrome oxidase activity, and mitochondrial ATP. MTT assays were used to assess the cell viability. Abeta42 was found to impair mitochondrial dynamics, lower mitochondrial biogenesis, lower synaptic activity, and lower mitochondrial function. On the contrary, Mdivi1 enhanced mitochondrial fusion activity, lowered fission machinery, and increased biogenesis and synaptic proteins. Mitochondrial function and cell viability were elevated in Mdivi1-treated cells. Interestingly, Mdivi1 pre- and post-treated cells treated with Abeta showed reduced mitochondrial dysfunction, and maintained cell viability, mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial biogenesis, and synaptic activity. The protective effects of Mdivi1 were stronger in N2a+Abeta42 pre-treated with Mdivi1, than in N2a+Abeta42 cells than Mdivi1 post-treated cells, indicating that Mdivi1 works better in prevention than treatment in AD like neurons.",

    "abstract": "The formation of senile plaques in central neural system resulting from the aggregation of the amyloid beta (Abeta) of 40 and 42 residues is one of the two hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Numerous experiments and computational studies have shown that the aggregation of Abeta peptides in vitro is very complex and depends on many factors such as pH, agitation, temperature, and peptide concentration. The impact of a static electric field (EF) on amyloid peptide aggregation has been much less studied, although EFs may have some applications to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms. Here, we study the influence of an EF strength of 20 mV/nm, present in the human brains, on the conformation of the Abeta29-42 dimer. Our 7 mus non-equilibrium atomistic simulations in aqueous solution show that this field-strength promotes substantially the formation of beta-hairpins, believed to be a very important intermediate state during aggregation. This work also suggests that structural biology experiments conducted under appropriate EF strengths may help reduce the conformational heterogeneity of Abeta1-40/Abeta1-42 dimers and provide significant insights into their structures that may be disease-causing.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal cellular accumulation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Intracellular accumulation of Abeta42, a toxic form of Abeta, was observed as an early event in AD patients. However, its contribution and the cellular mechanism of cell death remained unclear. We herein revealed the mechanism by which Abeta42 incorporated into cells leads to cell death by using chemically synthesized Abeta42 variants. The Abeta42 variant Abeta42 (E22P) which has an increased tendency to oligomerize, accumulated in lysosomes at an earlier stage than wild-type Abeta42, leading to higher ROS production and lysosomal membrane oxidation, and resulting in cell death. On the other hand, Abeta42 (E22V), which is incapable of oligomerization, did not accumulate in cells or affect the cell viability. Moreover, intracellular localization of EGFP-Galectin-3, a beta-galactoside binding lectin, showed that accumulation of oligomerized Abeta42 in lysosomes caused lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). Overexpression of lysosome-localized LAMP1-fused peroxiredoxin 1 and treatment with U18866A, an inhibitor of cholesterol export from lysosomes that causes an increase in lysosomal membrane stability, attenuated Abeta42-mediated LMP and cell death. Our findings show that lysosomal ROS generation by toxic conformer of Abeta led to cell death via LMP, and suggest that these events are potential targets for AD prevention.Key words: Amyloid-beta (Abeta), Cell death, Lysosome, Lysosomal membrane permeabilization, Reactive oxygen species (ROS).",

    "abstract": "Using PrPC-knockout cell lines, it has been shown that the inhibition of apoptosis through STI1 is mediated by PrPC-dependent SOD activation. Antioxidant PrPC may contribute to suppression of inflammasome activation. PrPC is functionally involved in copper metabolism, signal transduction, neuroprotection, and cell maturation. Recently several reports have shown that PrPC participates in trans-membrane signaling processes associated with hematopoietic stem cell replication and neuronal differentiation. In another role, PrPC also tends to function as a neurotoxic protein. Abeta oligomer, which is associated with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD), has also been reported to act as a ligand of PrPC. However, the physiological role of PrPC as an Abeta42-binding protein is not clear. Actually, PrPC is critical in Abeta42-mediated autophagy in neurons. PrPC shows a beneficial role in lipid rafts to promote autophagy. Further search for PrPC-interaction molecules using Prnp-/- mice and various types of Prnp-/- cell lines under various conditions may elucidate other important PrPC important functions.",

Multiple posttranslational modifications of Abeta have been identified, among which N-terminally truncated forms are the most abundant. It is not clear, however, whether modified species can induce synaptic dysfunction on their own and how altered biochemical properties can contribute to the synaptotoxic mechanisms. Here, we show that a prominent isoform, pyroglutamated Abeta3(pE)-42, induces synaptic dysfunction to a similar extent like Abeta1-42 but by clearly different mechanisms. In contrast to Abeta1-42, Abeta3(pE)-42 does not directly associate with synaptic membranes or the prion protein but is instead taken up by astrocytes and potently induces glial release of the proinflammatory cytokine TNFalpha. Moreover, Abeta3(pE)-42-induced synaptic dysfunction is not related to NMDAR signalling and Abeta3(pE)-42-induced impairment of synaptic plasticity cannot be rescued by D1-agonists. Collectively, the data point to a scenario where neuroinflammatory processes together with direct synaptotoxic effects are caused by posttranslational modification of soluble oligomeric Abeta and contribute synergistically to the onset of synaptic dysfunction in AD.",

These protein-based particles template conformational changes in a host-encoded prion protein to an insoluble self-like conformation. Prions are also present in yeast, where they support protein-based epigenetic inheritance. There is emerging evidence that prion-like (prionoid) particles can support a variety of pathological and beneficial functions. The recent data on the prionoid spread of other pathological amyloids are discussed in light of differences between prions and prion-like aggregates. On the other hand, prion-like action has also been found to support important functions such as memory, and amyloids were shown to have a variety of physiological roles from storage to scaffolding in simple organisms and in humans. Higher-order protein complexes play important roles in signalling. Many death-fold domains can polymerise upon nucleation to enhance sensitivity and induce a robust response. Although these polymers are structurally different from amyloids, some of them are characterised by prionoid activities, such as intercellular spread. The initial activation of these complexes is vital for organismal health, whereas prolonged activation leading to unresolved inflammation underlies autoinflammatory and other diseases. Prionoid complexes play important roles far beyond prion diseases and neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, Abeta40 and the more neurotoxic Abeta42, have been the subject of many research efforts for Alzheimer's disease. In two recent independent investigations, the atomistic structure of Abeta42 fibril has been clearly established in the S-shaped conformation consisting of three beta-sheets stabilized by salt bridges formed between the Lys28 sidechain and the C-terminus of Ala42. This structure distinctively differs from the long-known structure of Abeta40 in the beta-hairpin shaped conformation consisting of two beta-sheets. Recent in silico investigations based on all-atom models have reached closer agreement with the in vitro measurements of Abeta40 thermodynamics. In this study, we present an in silico investigation of Abeta42 thermodynamics. Using the established force field parameters in seven sets of all-atom simulations, we examined the stability of small Abeta42 oligomers in physiological saline. We computed the elongation affinity of the S-shaped Abeta42 fibril, reaching agreement with the experimental data. We also estimated the Arrhenius activation barrier along the elongation pathway (from the disordered conformation of a free Abeta42 peptide to its S-shaped conformation on a fibril) that amounts to about 16 kcal/mol, which is consistent with the experimental data. Based on these quantitative agreements, we conclude that aggregation of Abeta42 peptides into fibrils is thermodynamically slow without precipitation by extrinsic factors such as heparan sulfate proteoglycan and highlight the possibility to prevent Abeta42 aggregation by eliminating some precipitation factors or by increasing competitive agents to capture and transport free Abeta42 peptides from the cerebrospinal fluid.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation and deposition play a central role in the pathogenic process of Alzheimer's disease (AD). alpha-Mangostin (alpha-M), a polyphenolic xanthone, have been shown to dissociate Abeta oligomers. In this study, we further investigated the effect of alpha-M on Abeta production and its molecular mechanism. METHODS: The Abeta and soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPPalpha) in culture medium of cortical neurons were measured by ELISA. The activities of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretases were assayed, and the interaction between alpha-M and beta- or gamma-secretases was simulated by molecular docking. RESULTS: alpha-M significantly decreased Abeta40 and Abeta42 production. alpha-M did not affect the expression of enzymes involved in nonamyloidogenic and amyloidogenic pathways, but significantly decreased the activities of beta-secretase and likely gamma-secretase with IC50 13.22 nmol L-1 and 16.98 nmol L-1 , respectively. Molecular docking demonstrated that alpha-M interacted with beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 and presenilin 1 to interfere with their active sites. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that alpha-M decreases Abeta production through inhibiting activities of beta-secretase and likely gamma-secretase in the amyloidogenic pathway. The current data together with previous study indicated that alpha-M could be a novel neuroprotective agent through intervention of multiple pathological processes of AD.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms whereby Amyloidbeta (Abeta) induces the production of angiogenic factors by a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line (ARPE-19) cells. METHODS: ARPE-19 cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were utilized in this study. The expression level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and complement activation fragments C3a and C5a were measured by Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The production of mitochondria-associated reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The expression of VEGF, IL-8, MCP-1, C3a and C5a was significantly increased in Abeta-treated ARPE-19 cells. Mitochondria-associated ROS production was also significantly increased when exposed to Abeta. Inhibition of mitochondrial ROS with Diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) markedly decreased the Abeta induced production of VEGF, IL-8, MCP-1, C3a and C5a by ARPE-19 cells. Anti-C3a or anti-C5a neutralizing antibodies did not have a detectable influence on the secretion of VEGF, IL-8 and MCP-1 by ARPE-19 cells upon stimulation with Abeta. CONCLUSION: Our results support the hypothesis that Abeta is involved in the pathogenesis of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) formation by promoting the production of the angiogenic cytokines VEGF, IL-8 and MCP-1 by RPE cells. Mitochondrial ROS was shown to play a role in the regulation of Abeta induced expression of these cytokines.",

    "abstract": "The spatiotemporal pattern of cerebral amyloid deposition, detectable as light microscopically recognizable aggregates in an 'amyloid only' transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, B6C3-Tg(APPswe,PSEN1dE9)85Dbo/Mmjax, is reported for the first time in this strain. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were used to detect amyloid deposition immunohistochemically in brains collected from these mice at 3-12 months of age. Amyloid aggregates (20-200 mum) were first found in serial, whole coronal sections of brain at 4 months of age and these increased progressively, plateauing at 11-12 months. They were most abundant in the cerebral cortices, hippocampus, olfactory bulbs, some white matter tracts and the cerebellar molecular layer; no amyloid aggregates were found in the midbrain, brainstem or spinal cord, or in an equivalent number of brains from wild-type mice. Since the parahippocampal gyrus is severely damaged early in the clinical course of human Alzheimer's disease, amyloid aggregates were also assessed in this brain region and a similar temporal course of amyloid deposition was observed. Moreover, in this gyrus, the amount of aggregated amyloid showed no significant difference between left- and right-sided gyri. However, the polyclonal antibody detected a significantly greater amyloid burden than the monoclonal antibody at 3-10 months of age and the reverse was seen at 11-12 months of age. The pattern of amyloid deposition in the parahippocampal gyrus also resembled that found in the entire brain over time, when the latter was quantified by the colour deconvolution method, suggesting that this gyrus is a good marker for more widely distributed cerebral amyloid deposition. This neuropathological characterization will permit better use of the B6C3-Tg(APPswe,PSEN1dE9)85Dbo/Mmjax transgenic mouse strain in future studies of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, prevention and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Excessive mitochondrial fission is a prominent early event and contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic failure, and neuronal cell death in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it remains to be determined whether inhibition of excessive mitochondrial fission is beneficial in mammal models of AD. To determine whether dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a key regulator of mitochondrial fragmentation, can be a disease-modifying therapeutic target for AD, we examined the effects of Drp1 inhibitor on mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunctions induced by oligomeric amyloid-beta (Abeta) in neurons and neuropathology and cognitive functions in Abeta precursor protein/presenilin 1 double-transgenic AD mice. Inhibition of Drp1 alleviates mitochondrial fragmentation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species production, ATP reduction, and synaptic depression in Abeta-treated neurons. Furthermore, Drp1 inhibition significantly improves learning and memory and prevents mitochondrial fragmentation, lipid peroxidation, BACE1 expression, and Abeta deposition in the brain in the AD model. These results provide evidence that Drp1 plays an important role in Abeta-mediated and AD-related neuropathology and in cognitive decline in an AD animal model. Therefore, inhibiting excessive Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission may be an efficient therapeutic avenue for AD.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Mitochondrial fission relies on the evolutionary conserved dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). Drp1 activity and mitochondria fragmentation are significantly elevated in the brains of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases. In the present study, we first demonstrated that the inhibition of Drp1 restored amyloid-beta (Abeta)-mediated mitochondrial dysfunctions and synaptic depression in neurons and significantly reduced lipid peroxidation, BACE1 expression, and Abeta deposition in the brain of AD mice. As a result, memory deficits in AD mice were rescued by Drp1 inhibition. These results suggest that neuropathology and combined cognitive decline can be attributed to hyperactivation of Drp1 in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, inhibitors of excessive mitochondrial fission, such as Drp1 inhibitors, may be a new strategy for AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and represent a promising target for drug development. Tramiprosate is a small-molecule Abeta anti-aggregation agent that was evaluated in phase III clinical trials for AD but did not meet the primary efficacy endpoints; however, a pre-specified subgroup analysis revealed robust, sustained, and clinically meaningful cognitive and functional effects in patients with AD homozygous for the epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4/4 homozygotes), who carry an increased risk for the disease. Therefore, to build on this important efficacy attribute and to further improve its pharmaceutical properties, we have developed a prodrug of tramiprosate ALZ-801 that is in advanced stages of clinical development. To elucidate how tramiprosate works, we investigated its molecular mechanism of action (MOA) and the translation to observed clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The two main objectives of this research were to (1) elucidate and characterize the MOA of tramiprosate via an integrated application of three independent molecular methodologies and (2) present an integrated translational analysis that links the MOA, conformation of the target, stoichiometry, and pharmacokinetic dose exposure to the observed clinical outcome in APOE4/4 homozygote subjects. METHOD: We used three molecular analytical methods-ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and molecular dynamics-to characterize the concentration-related interactions of tramiprosate versus Abeta42 monomers and the resultant conformational alterations affecting aggregation into oligomers. The molecular stoichiometry of the tramiprosate versus Abeta42 interaction was further analyzed in the context of clinical pharmacokinetic dose exposure and central nervous system Abeta42 levels (i.e., pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic translation in humans). RESULTS: We observed a multi-ligand interaction of tramiprosate with monomeric Abeta42, which differs from the traditional 1:1 binding. This resulted in the stabilization of Abeta42 monomers and inhibition of oligomer formation and elongation, as demonstrated by IMS-MS and molecular dynamics. Using NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, we also showed that tramiprosate bound to Lys16, Lys28, and Asp23, the key amino acid side chains of Abeta42 that are responsible for both conformational seed formation and neuronal toxicity. The projected molar excess of tramiprosate versus Abeta42 in humans using the dose effective in patients with AD aligned with the molecular stoichiometry of the interaction, providing a clear clinical translation of the MOA. A consistent alignment of these preclinical-to-clinical elements describes a unique example of translational medicine and supports the efficacy seen in symptomatic patients with AD. This unique \"enveloping mechanism\" of tramiprosate also provides a potential basis for tramiprosate dose selection for patients with homozygous AD at earlier stages of disease. CONCLUSION: We have identified the molecular mechanism that may account for the observed clinical efficacy of tramiprosate in patients with APOE4/4 homozygous AD. In addition, the integrated application of the molecular methodologies (i.e., IMS-MS, NMR, and thermodynamics analysis) indicates that it is feasible to modulate and control the Abeta42 conformational dynamics landscape by a small molecule, resulting in a favorable Abeta42 conformational change that leads to a clinically relevant amyloid anti-aggregation effect and inhibition of oligomer formation. This novel enveloping MOA of tramiprosate has potential utility in the development of disease-modifying therapies for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases caused by misfolded proteins.",

    "abstract": "We show that amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta42) triggers a conformational change in the scaffolding protein filamin A (FLNA) to induce FLNA associations with alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). These aberrant associations respectively enable Abeta42's toxic signaling via alpha7nAChR to hyperphosphorylate tau protein, and TLR4 activation to release inflammatory cytokines. PTI-125 is a small molecule that preferentially binds altered FLNA and restores its native conformation, restoring receptor and synaptic activities and reducing its alpha7nAChR/TLR4 associations and downstream pathologies. Two-month oral PTI-125 administration to triple-transgenic (3xTg) Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice before or after apparent neuropathology and to 8-month wildtypes with milder neuropathologies reduced receptor dysfunctions and improved synaptic plasticity, with some improvements in nesting behavior and spatial and working memory in 3xTg AD mice. PTI-125 also reduced tau hyperphosphorylation, aggregated Abeta42 deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuroinflammation. Efficacy in postmortem AD and Abeta42-treated age-matched control hippocampal slices was concentration-dependent starting at 1 picomolar (pM) concentration. PTI-125 is the first therapeutic candidate to preferentially bind an altered protein conformation and reverse this proteopathy.",

This study investigates the memory-improving and cytoprotective effects of acteoside and isoacteoside in amyloid beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta 1-42)-infused rats and Abeta 1-42-treated SH-SY5Y cells. It further elucidates the role of amyloid cascade and central neuronal function in these effects. Acteoside and isoacteoside ameliorated cognitive deficits, decreased amyloid deposition, and reversed central cholinergic dysfunction that were caused by Abeta 1-42 in rats. Acteoside and isoacteoside further decreased extracellular Abeta 1-40 production and restored the cell viability that was decreased by Abeta 1-42 in SH-SY5Y cells. Acteoside and isoacteoside also promoted Abeta 1-40 degradation and inhibited Abeta 1-42 oligomerization in vitro. However, the memory-improving and cytoprotective effects of isoacteoside exceeded those of acteoside. Isoacteoside promoted exploratory behavior and restored cortical and hippocampal dopamine levels, but acteoside did not. We suggest that acteoside and isoacteoside ameliorated the cognitive dysfunction that was caused by Abeta 1-42 by blocking amyloid deposition via preventing amyloid oligomerization, and reversing central neuronal function via counteracting amyloid cytotoxicity.",

    "title": "Evaluation of a DNA Abeta42 vaccine in adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta): antibody kinetics and immune profile after intradermal immunization with full-length DNA Abeta42 trimer.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aggregated amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta42), derived from the cellular amyloid precursor protein, is one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although active immunization against Abeta42 peptide was successful in AD mouse models and led to removal of plaques and improved memory, a similar clinical trial in humans (Abeta42 peptide immunization with QS-21 adjuvant) was stopped in phase II, when 6% of the treated patients developed encephalitis. Currently ongoing passive immunizations with the injection of preformed monoclonal antibodies against different epitopes within the Abeta1-42 peptide, which do not lead to activation of the immune system, have shown some effects in slowing AD pathology. Active DNA Abeta42 immunizations administered with the gene gun into the skin are noninflammatory because they activate a different T-cell population (Th2) with different cytokine responses eliciting a different humoral immune response. We present our findings in rhesus macaques that underwent the DNA Abeta42 immunization via gene gun delivery into the skin. METHODS: Six rhesus monkeys received two different doses of a DNA Abeta42 trimer vaccine. The humoral immune response was analyzed from blood throughout the study, and cellular immune responses were determined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after three and six immunizations. RESULTS: DNA Abeta42 trimer immunization led to high titer antibody responses in the nonhuman primate (NHP) model. Antibodies generated in the rhesus monkeys following DNA Abeta42 immunization detected amyloid plaques consisting of human Abeta42 peptide in the brain of the triple-transgenic AD mouse model. T-cell responses showed no interferon (IFN)-gamma- and interleukin (IL)-17-producing cells from PBMCs in Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot assays after three immunization time points. At six immunization time points, IFN-gamma- and IL-17-producing cells were found in immunized animals as well as in control animals and were thus considered nonspecific and not due to the immunization regimen. IFN-gamma and IL-17 secretion in response to Abeta42 peptide restimulation became undetectable after a 3-month rest period. CONCLUSIONS: Intradermal DNA Abeta42 immunization delivered with the gene gun produces a high antibody response in NHPs and is highly likely to be effective and safe in a clinical AD prevention trial in patients.",

    "abstract": "In epidemiology, cohort studies utilised to monitor and assess disease status and progression often result in short-term and sparse follow-up data. Thus, gaining an understanding of the full-term disease pathogenesis can be difficult, requiring shorter-term data from many individuals to be collated. We investigate and evaluate methods to construct and quantify the underlying long-term longitudinal trajectories for disease markers using short-term follow-up data, specifically applied to Alzheimer's disease. We generate individuals' follow-up data to investigate approaches to this problem adopting a four-step modelling approach that (i) determines individual slopes and anchor points for their short-term trajectory, (ii) fits polynomials to these slopes and anchor points, (iii) integrates the reciprocated polynomials and (iv) inverts the resulting curve providing an estimate of the underlying longitudinal trajectory. To alleviate the potential problem of roots of polynomials falling into the region over which we integrate, we propose the use of non-negative polynomials in Step 2. We demonstrate that our approach can construct underlying sigmoidal trajectories from individuals' sparse, short-term follow-up data. Furthermore, to determine an optimal methodology, we consider variations to our modelling approach including contrasting linear mixed effects regression to linear regression in Step 1 and investigating different orders of polynomials in Step 2. Cubic order polynomials provided more accurate results, and there were negligible differences between regression methodologies. We use bootstrap confidence intervals to quantify the variability in our estimates of the underlying longitudinal trajectory and apply these methods to data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative to demonstrate their practical use.

    "title": "Curcumin Dictates Divergent Fates for the Central Salt Bridges in Amyloid-beta40 and Amyloid-beta42.",
    "abstract": "There are three specific regions in the Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide sequence where variations cause enhanced toxicity in Alzheimer's disease: the N-terminus, the central salt bridge, and the C-terminus. Here, we investigate if there is a close conformational connection between these three regions, which may suggest a concerted mechanism of toxicity. We measure the effects of Zn2+ and curcumin on Abeta40, and compare these with their previously reported effects on Abeta42. Abeta42 and Abeta40 differ only near the C-terminus, where curcumin interacts, while Zn2+ interacts near the N-terminus. Therefore, this comparison should help us differentiate the effect of modulating the C- and the N-termini. We find that curcumin allows fibril-like structures containing the salt bridge to emerge in the mature Abeta40 aggregates, but not in Abeta42. In contrast, we find no difference in the effects of Zn+2 on Abeta40 and Abeta42. In the presence of Zn+2, both of these fail to form proper fibrils, and the salt bridge remains disrupted. These results indicate that modulations of the Abeta termini can determine the fate of a salt bridge far away in the sequence, and this has significant consequences for Abeta toxicity. We also infer that small molecules can alter oligomer-induced toxicity by modulating the aggregation pathway, without substantially changing the final product of aggregation.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ginkgo biloba has been reported to possess free radical-scavenging antioxidant activity and anti-inflammatory properties. In our pilot study, YY-1224, a terpene trilactone-strengthened extract of G. biloba, showed anti-inflammatory, neurotrophic, and antioxidant effects. RESULTS: We investigated the pharmacological potential of YY-1224 in beta-amyloid (Abeta) (1-42)-induced memory impairment using cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) knockout (-/-) and APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic (APP/PS1 Tg) mice. Repeated treatment with YY-1224 significantly attenuated Abeta (1-42)-induced memory impairment in COX-2 (+/+) mice, but not in COX-2 (-/-) mice. YY-1224 significantly attenuated Abeta (1-42)-induced upregulation of platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor gene expression, reactive oxygen species, and pro-inflammatory factors. In addition, YY-1224 significantly inhibited Abeta (1-42)-induced downregulation of PAF-acetylhydrolase-1 (PAF-AH-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) gene expression. These changes were more pronounced in COX-2 (+/+) mice than in COX-2 (-/-) mice. YY-1224 significantly attenuated learning impairment, Abeta deposition, and pro-inflammatory microglial activation in APP/PS1 Tg mice, whereas it significantly enhanced PAF-AH and PPARgamma expression. A preferential COX-2 inhibitor, meloxicam, did not affect the pharmacological activity by YY-1224, suggesting that the COX-2 gene is a critical mediator of the neuroprotective effects of YY-1224. The protective activity of YY-1224 appeared to be more efficacious than a standard G. biloba extract (Gb) against Abeta insult. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the protective effects of YY-1224 against Abeta toxicity may be associated with its PAF antagonistic- and PPARgamma agonistic-potential as well as inhibition of the Abeta-mediated pro-inflammatory switch of microglia phenotypes through suppression of COX-2 expression.",

    "title": "APLP1 Is a Synaptic Cell Adhesion Molecule, Supporting Maintenance of Dendritic Spines and Basal Synaptic Transmission.",
    "abstract": "The amyloid precursor protein (APP), a key player in Alzheimer's disease, belongs to the family of synaptic adhesion molecules (SAMs) due to its impact on synapse formation and synaptic plasticity. These functions are mediated by both the secreted APP ectodomain that acts as a neurotrophic factor and full-length APP forming trans-cellular dimers. Two homologs of APP exist in mammals: the APP like proteins APLP1 and APLP2, exhibiting functions that partly overlap with those of APP. Here we tested whether APLP1 and APLP2 also show features of SAMs. We found that all three family members were upregulated during postnatal development coinciding with synaptogenesis. We observed presynaptic and postsynaptic localization of all APP family members and could show that heterologous expression of APLP1 or APLP2 in non-neuronal cells induces presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons of cocultured neurons, similar to APP and other SAMs. Moreover, APP/APLPs all bind to synaptic-signaling molecules, such as MINT/X11. Furthermore, we report that aged APLP1 knock-out mice show impaired basal transmission and a reduced mEPSC frequency, likely resulting from reduced spine density. This demonstrates an essential nonredundant function of APLP1 at the synapse. Compared to APP, APLP1 exhibits increased trans-cellular binding and elevated cell-surface levels due to reduced endocytosis. In conclusion, our results establish that APLPs show typical features of SAMs and indicate that increased surface expression, as observed for APLP1, is essential for proper synapse formation in vitro and synapse maintenance in vivoSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT According to the amyloid-cascade hypothesis, Alzheimer's disease is caused by the accumulation of Abeta peptides derived from sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and gamma-secretase. Here we show that all mammalian APP family members (APP, APLP1, and APLP2) exhibit synaptogenic activity, involving trans-synaptic dimerization, similar to other synaptic cell adhesion molecules, such as Neuroligin/Neurexin. Importantly, our study revealed that the loss of APLP1, which is one of the major substrates of BACE1, causes reduced spine density in aged mice. Because some therapeutic interventions target APP processing (e.g., BACE inhibitors), those strategies may alter APP/APLP physiological function. This should be taken into account for the development of pharmaceutical treatments of Alzheimer's disease.",

However, BMI alterations in preclinical individuals with autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) have not yet been investigated. We analyzed cross-sectional data from 230 asymptomatic members of families with ADAD participating in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) study including 120 preclinical mutation carriers (MCs) and 110 asymptomatic non-carriers (NCs). Differences in BMI and their relation with cerebral amyloid load and episodic memory as a function of estimated years to symptom onset (EYO) were analyzed. Preclinical MCs showed significantly lower BMIs compared to NCs, starting 11.2 years before expected symptom onset. However, the BMI curves begun to diverge already at 17.8 years before expected symptom onset. Lower BMI in preclinical MCs was significantly associated with less years before estimated symptom onset, higher global Abeta brain burden, and with lower delayed total recall scores in the logical memory test. The study provides cross-sectional evidence that weight loss starts one to two decades before expected symptom onset of ADAD. Our findings point toward a link between the pathophysiology of ADAD and disturbance of weight control mechanisms. Longitudinal follow-up studies are warranted to investigate BMI changes over time.",

This method is designed to overcome hidden-variable sampling limitations to yield nearly error-free free-energy profiles along a conformational coordinate. We confirm that all four (M129V, D178N) polymorphs have a ground-state conformation with three intact beta-sheet hydrogen bonds. Additionally, they are observed to have distinct metastabilities determined by the side-chain at position 129. We rationalize these findings with reference to the prion \"strain\" hypothesis, which links the variety of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy phenotypes to conformationally distinct infectious prion forms and classifies distinct phenotypes of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease based solely on the 129 polymorphism. Because such metastable structures are not easily observed in structural experiments, our approach could potentially provide new insights into the conformational origins of prion diseases and other pathologies arising from protein misfolding and aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder linked to oligomerization and fibrillization of amyloid beta peptides, with Abeta1-42 being the most aggregative and neurotoxic one. We report herein the synthesis and conformational analysis of Abeta1-42-amyloid related beta-hairpin peptidomimetics, built on a piperidine-pyrrolidine semi rigid beta-turn inducer and bearing two small recognition peptide sequences, designed on oligomeric and fibril structures of Abeta1-42. According to these peptide sequences, a stable beta-hairpin or a dynamic equilibrium between two possible architectures was observed. These original constructs are able to greatly delay the kinetics of Abeta1-42 aggregation process as demonstrated by thioflavin-T fluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy. Capillary electrophoresis indicates their ability to preserve the monomer species, inhibiting the formation of toxic oligomers. Furthermore, compounds protect against toxic effects of Abeta on neuroblastoma cells even at substoichiometric concentrations. This study is the first example of acyclic small beta-hairpin mimics possessing such a highly efficient anti-aggregation activity. The protective effect is more pronounced than that observed with molecules which have undergone clinical trials. The structural elements made in this study provide valuable insights in the understanding of the aggregation process and insights to explore the design of novel acyclic beta-hairpin targeting other types of amyloid-forming proteins.",

However, it has been challenging to discover potent agents in order to inhibit Abeta fibrillation. Herein, we demonstrated the effect of resorcinarene on inhibiting Abeta fibrillation in vitro via experimental and computational methods. Abeta were incubated with different concentrations of resorcinarene so as to monitor the kinetics by using thioflavin T binding assay. The results, which were further confirmed by far-UV CD spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy, strongly indicated that the higher concentration of resorcinarene, the more effective the inhibition of Abeta fibrillation. A cytotoxicity study showed that when sea urchin embryos were exposed to the resorcinarene, the majority survived due to the resorcinarene low toxicity. In addition, when the resorcinarene was added, the formation of toxic Abeta 42 species was delayed. Computational studies of Abeta fibrillation, including docking simulations and MD simulations, illustrated that the interaction between inhibitor resorcinarene and Abeta is driven by the non-polar interactions. These studies display a novel strategy for the exploration of promising antiamyloiddogenic agents for AD treatments.",

Unlike structural analysis of proteins using chemical reagents specific for lysine or cysteine residues, identification of gas-phase fragmentation patterns of endogenous dityrosine cross-linked peptides have not been investigated. Dityrosine cross-linking in proteins and peptides are clinical markers of oxidative stress, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In this study, we investigated and characterized the fragmentation pattern of a synthetically prepared dityrosine cross-linked dimer of Abeta(1-16) using ESI tandem mass spectrometry. We then detailed the fragmentation pattern of dityrosine cross-linked Abeta(1-16), using collision induced dissociation (CID), higher-energy collision induced dissociation (HCD), electron transfer dissociation (ETD), and electron capture dissociation (ECD). Application of these generic fragmentation rules of dityrosine cross-linked peptides allowed for the identification of dityrosine cross-links in peptides of Abeta and alpha-synuclein generated in vitro by enzymatic peroxidation. We report, for the first time, the dityrosine cross-linked residues in human hemoglobin and alpha-synuclein under oxidative conditions. Together these tools open up the potential for automated analysis of this naturally occurring post-translation modification in neurodegenerative diseases as well as other pathological conditions.",

    "abstract": "To elucidate an involvement of amyloid dysmetabolism in the pathophysiology of depression, we investigated associations of plasma amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels with Alzheimer's disease-related changes in neuroimaging and cognitive dysfunction in patients with late-life depression. Higher plasma Abeta40, but not Abeta42 nor Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio, was associated with higher degree of parahippocampal atrophy and lower verbal fluency performance. Indeed, high plasma Abeta40 predicted poor cognitive prognosis of depressed patients with mild cognitive impairment. As an anti-depressive treatment, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) resulted in a marginally significant reduction of plasma Abeta40 compared to pharmacotherapy alone, suggesting protective effects of ECT against amyloid dysmetabolism.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are mainly involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), the main component of senile plaques, is a kind of strong inducer of oxidative stress. Glutathione is an endogenous antioxidant protecting cells from oxidative injury. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) produced in the methionine cycle is the primary methyl donor and the precursor of glutathione. In this study, the Abeta intrahippocampal injection rat model and cultured SH-SY5Y cells were used to explore the neuroprotective effect of SAM. We found that SAM could protect cells against Abeta-induced cellular injury by inhibition of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. SAM administration could increase the endogenous antioxidant glutathione and potentiate the antioxidant enzymes activities. SAM might act as an antioxidant and be a potential candidate therapy for AD patients.",

    "title": "Amyloid beta-Sheet Secondary Structure Identified in UV-Induced Cataracts of Porcine Lenses using 2D IR Spectroscopy.",
    "abstract": "Cataracts are formed by the aggregation of crystallin proteins in the eye lens. Many in vitro studies have established that crystallin proteins precipitate into aggregates that contain amyloid fibers when denatured, but there is little evidence that ex vivo cataracts contain amyloid. In this study, we collect two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectra on tissue slices of porcine eye lenses. As shown in control experiments on in vitro alphaB- and gammaD-crystallin, 2D IR spectroscopy can identify the highly ordered beta-sheets typical of amyloid secondary structure even if the fibers themselves are too short to be resolved with TEM. In ex vivo experiments of acid-treated tissues, characteristic 2D IR features are observed and fibers >50nm in length are resolved by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), consistent with amyloid fibers. In UV-irradiated lens tissues, fibers are not observed with TEM, but highly ordered beta-sheets of amyloid secondary structure is identified from the 2D IR spectra. The characteristic 2D IR features of amyloid beta-sheet secondary structure are created by as few as four or five strands and so identify amyloid secondary structure even if the aggregates themselves are too small to be resolved with TEM. We discuss these findings in the context of the chaperone system of the lens, which we hypothesize sequesters small aggregates, thereby preventing long fibers from forming. This study expands the scope of heterodyned 2D IR spectroscopy to tissues. The results provide a link between in vitro and ex vivo studies and support the hypothesis that cataracts are an amyloid disease.",

    "abstract": "Sleep disorders have previously been connected with the neurodegenerative pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to the aggregation of beta-amyloid(Abeta)peptides and tau proteinsinduced by sleep deprivation (SD). However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, this study was performed to clarify how Abeta-related metabolism is regulated after SD. Three-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300g) were randomly divided into 5 groups: two SD groups(i.e.,SD-2d and SD-4d), two platform control groups(i.e.,PC-2d and PC-4d) and a home cage control group (CC). For the two SD groups, themodified multiple platform method (MMPM) was used to induce SD.Our experiments confirmed that SD impaired cognitive function and increased the levels of Abeta peptides, a hallmark of AD. Additionally, we found that SD significantly increasedthe levels of the beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1(BACE1, beta-secretase), but had little impacton the levels of Abeta-degradationenzymes.This resultmay be the main cause of the over-expression of Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40. Our results suggested that SD accelerates the progression of AD bymodulating Abeta-related metabolism. This findinghasimportant implications for the diagnosis and prevention of AD.",

    "title": "Age-specific and sex-specific prevalence of cerebral beta-amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration in cognitively unimpaired individuals aged 50-95 years: a cross-sectional study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A new classification for biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease and cognitive ageing research is based on grouping the markers into three categories: amyloid deposition (A), tauopathy (T), and neurodegeneration or neuronal injury (N). Dichotomising these biomarkers as normal or abnormal results in eight possible profiles. We determined the clinical characteristics and prevalence of each ATN profile in cognitively unimpaired individuals aged 50 years and older. METHODS: All participants were in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, a population-based study that uses a medical records linkage system to enumerate all individuals aged 50-89 years in Olmsted County, MN, USA. Potential participants are randomly selected, stratified by age and sex, and invited to participate in cognitive assessments; individuals without medical contraindications are invited to participate in brain imaging studies. Participants who were judged clinically as having no cognitive impairment and underwent multimodality imaging between Oct 11, 2006, and Oct 5, 2016, were included in the current study. Participants were classified as having normal (A-) or abnormal (A+) amyloid using amyloid PET, normal (T-) or abnormal (T+) tau using tau PET, and normal (N-) or abnormal (N+) neurodegeneration or neuronal injury using cortical thickness assessed by MRI. We used the cutoff points of standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) 1 42 (centiloid 19) for amyloid PET, 1 23 SUVR for tau PET, and 2 67 mm for MRI cortical thickness. Age-specific and sex-specific prevalences of the eight groups were determined using multinomial models combining data from 435 individuals with amyloid PET, tau PET, and MRI assessments, and 1113 individuals who underwent amyloid PET and MRI, but not tau PET imaging. FINDINGS: The numbers of participants in each profile group were 165 A-T-N-, 35 A-T+N-, 63 A-T-N+, 19 A-T+N+, 44 A+T-N-, 25 A+T+N-, 35 A+T-N+, and 49 A+T+N+. Age differed by ATN group (p<0 0001), ranging from a median 58 years (IQR 55-64) in A-T-N- and 57 years (54-64) in A-T+N- to a median 80 years (75-84) in A+T-N+ and 79 years (73-87) in A+T+N+. The number of APOE epsilon4 carriers differed by ATN group (p=0 04), with carriers roughly twice as frequent in each A+ group versus the corresponding A- group. White matter hyperintensity volume (p<0 0001) and cognitive performance (p<0 0001) also differed by ATN group. Tau PET and neurodegeneration biomarkers were discordant in most individuals who would be categorised as stage 2 or 3 preclinical Alzheimer's disease (A+T+N-, A+T-N+, and A+T+N+; 86% at age 65 years and 51% at age 80 years) or with suspected non-Alzheimer's pathophysiology (A-T+N-, A-T-N+, and A-T+N+; 92% at age 65 years and 78% at age 80 years). From age 50 years, A-T-N- prevalence declined and A+T+N+ and A-T+N+ prevalence increased. In both men and women, A-T-N- was the most prevalent until age late 70s. After about age 80 years, A+T+N+ was most prevalent. By age 85 years, more than 90% of men and women had one or more biomarker abnormalities. INTERPRETATION: Biomarkers of fibrillar tau deposition can be included with those of beta-amyloidosis and neurodegeneration or neuronal injury to more fully characterise the heterogeneous pathological profiles in the population. Both amyloid- dependent and amyloid-independent pathological profiles can be identified in the cognitively unimpaired population. The prevalence of each ATN group changed substantially with age, with progression towards more biomarker abnormalities among individuals who remained cognitively unimpaired.

    "abstract": "The excess accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides derived from the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by secretases, is one of the toxic key events leading to neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have shown that cholinergic activity may also be involved in the regulation of APP metabolism. In the current study, we have investigated the roles of toluidine blue O (TBO) and thionine (TH), newly recognized phenothiazine-derived cholinesterase inhibitors, on the metabolism of APP in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing human APP751 and presenilin 1 (PS70 cells). We assessed the effects of both compounds on the levels of Abeta, soluble APP-alpha (sAPPalpha), intracellular APP and beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). After treatment of PS70 cells with TBO or TH without any side effect on cell viability, the levels of secreted Abeta40, Abeta42 and sAPPalpha were assayed by specific sandwich ELISAs while APP and BACE1 in cell lysates were analyzed using Western blot. The secreted Abeta40, Abeta42 and sAPPalpha in TBO- and TH-treated cells were found to be reduced in a dose-dependent manner compared to vehicle-treated cells. Results suggest that TH mitigated the Abeta pathology by lowering APP levels whereas reduced Abeta caused by TBO treatment seems to be the outcome of both less substrate availability and amyloidogenic APP processing. Taken together, our results represent the first report demonstrating that TBO and TH can affect amyloid metabolism in vitro.",

    "abstract": "The deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) has been involved in neurodegeneration of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Besides Abeta plaques and neuronal loss, microglia activation is also common in AD patient brains, suggesting its important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Although activation of microglia by Abeta plaques has been demonstrated, the mechanism underlying it is still largely unclear. Here, we found that TRPC6 has a crucial role in microglia activation by Abeta. Abeta up-regulates the level of TRPC6 via NF-kappaB in BV-2 microglia and increases the expression of pro-inflammatory factors and oxidative enzyme, COX-2. Knock-down of TRPC6 reduces the Abeta-induced expression of pro-inflammatory factors and COX-2 and the damage of hippocampus neurons. Furthermore, inhibition of COX-2 also protects hippocampus neurons from Abeta-induced inflammatory damage. Collectively, our studies suggest that Abeta increase the expression of TRPC6 via NF-kappaB in BV-2 microglia and promotes the production of COX-2, which induces hippocampus neuron damage.",

    "abstract": "Inflammation plays critical roles in the pathogenic mechanisms of several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous study revealed that CoQ10 augmented cellular antioxidant defense capacity, thereby protecting PC12 cells from oxidative neurotoxicity. However, the mechanism by which CoQ10 inhibits inflammation remains unknown. In this study, we aim to examine the effects of CoQ10 on Abeta25-35-induced inflammatory in PC12 cells and the underlying molecular mechanism of its neuroprotective action. CoQ10 suppressed the protein expression of COX-2 and the level of PGE2 in Abeta25-35-injured PC12 cells. These inhibitions appeared to correlate with the suppression of NF-kappaB activation by CoQ10, as pretreating PC12 cells with CoQ10 blocked the translocation of NF-kappaB into the nuclear compartment and degradation of the inhibitory subunit IkappaB. Overall, these results implied that CoQ10 attenuated neuroinflammatory responses through the inactivation of NF-kappaB dependent inflammatory pathways in Abeta25-35-induced PC12 cells. Therefore, CoQ10 may have therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases by inhibiting pro-inflammatory mediators production.",

    "abstract": "Soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomer is believed to be the most important toxic species in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Thus, it is critical to develop a simple method for the selective detection of Abeta oligomer with low cost and high sensitivity. In this paper, we report an electrochemical method for the detection of Abeta oligomer with a peptide as the bioreceptor and silver nanoparticle (AgNP) aggregates as the redox reporters. This strategy is based on the conversion of AgNP-based colorimetric assay into electrochemical analysis. Specifically, the peptide immobilized on the electrode surface and presented in solution triggered together the in situ formation of AgNP aggregates, which produced a well-defined electrochemical signal. However, the specific binding of Abeta oligomer to the immobilized peptide prevented the in situ assembly of AgNPs. As a result, a poor electrochemical signal was observed. The detection limit of the method was found to be 6 pM. Furthermore, the amenability of this method for the analysis of Abeta oligomer in serum and artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) samples was demonstrated.",

Among them, deletions of exon 9 have been reported to be associated with a phenotype of spastic paraparesis. Using exome data from a large sample of 522 EOAD cases and 584 controls to search for genomic copy-number variations (CNVs), we report here a novel partial, in-frame deletion of PSEN1, removing both exons 9 and 10. The patient presented with memory impairment associated with spastic paraparesis, both starting from the age of 56years. He presented a positive family history of EOAD. We performed functional analysis to elucidate the impact of this novel deletion on PSEN1 activity as part of the gamma-secretase complex. The deletion does not affect the assembly of a mature protease complex but has an extreme impact on its global endopeptidase activity. The mutant carboxypeptidase-like activity is also strongly impaired and the deleterious mutant effect leads to an incomplete digestion of long Abeta peptides and enhances the production of Abeta43, which has been shown to be potently amyloidogenic and neurotoxic in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Activation of glial cells has been observed in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) is profusely observed as characteristic pathology in AD brain. In our previous study using microglial cell line BV-2, tissue-type transglutaminase (TG2) was found to be involved in phagocytosis (Kawabe et al., in Neuroimmunomodulation 22(4):243-249, 2015; Kawabe et al., Neurochem Res 2017). In the present study, we examined whether TG2 and milk fat globule EGF factor 8 protein (MFG-E8), an adaptor protein promotes macrophage to engulf apoptotic cells, were involved in Abeta endocytosis. When the neuronal/glial mixed culture was stimulated freshly prepared Abeta1-42 for 3 days, the incorporation of Abeta was observed by immunofluorescence staining technique in Iba-1-positive microglia. Cystamine, a broad competitive inhibitor of TGs, suppressed it. When aggregated Abeta was added to the mixed culture, the immunoreactivity of MFG-E8 surrounding Abeta was observed, and then followed by microglial endocytosis. Using western blotting technique, MFG-E8 was detected in cell lysate of astrocyte culture, and was also detected in the medium. When microglia culture was incubated with astrocyte conditioned medium, MFG-E8 levels in microglia tended to increase. It is likely that microglia might utilize MFG-E8 released from astrocytes as well as that expressed in themselves in order to endocytose Abeta aggregation. Furthermore, we confirmed that MFG-E8 could bind with TG2 in microglia culture by immunoprecipitate technique. These results suggest that microglia might uptake Abeta as a complex of aggregated Abeta/MFG-E8/TG2.",

Hence, we examined the cross-sectional associations between cortical beta-amyloid (Abeta) and erythrocyte membrane PUFAs in 61 non-demented elderly individuals reporting subjective memory complaints from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial placebo arm. Cortical-to-cerebellar standard uptake value ratios were obtained using [18 F] florbetapir positron emission tomography. Fatty acids were measured in erythrocyte membranes by gas chromatography. Associations were explored using adjusted multiple linear regression models and were considered significant at p <= 0.005 after correction for multiple testing (10 comparisons). We found no significant associations between cortical Abeta and erythrocyte membrane PUFAs. The associations closest to significance after adjustment were those between Abeta and erythrocyte membrane arachidonic acid (without apolipoprotein E status adjustment: B-coefficient, 0.03; CI, 0.01, 0.05; p = 0.02.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism on longitudinal cognitive trajectories in a large, cognitively healthy cohort enriched for Alzheimer disease (AD) risk and to understand whether beta-amyloid (Abeta) burden plays a moderating role in this relationship. METHODS: One thousand twenty-three adults (baseline age 54.94 +- 6.41 years) enrolled in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention underwent BDNF genotyping and cognitive assessment at up to 5 time points (average follow-up 6.92 +- 3.22 years). A subset (n = 140) underwent 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) scanning. Covariate-adjusted mixed-effects regression models were used to elucidate the effect of BDNF on cognitive trajectories in 4 cognitive domains, including verbal learning and memory, speed and flexibility, working memory, and immediate memory. Secondary mixed-effects regression models were conducted to examine whether Abeta burden, indexed by composite PiB load, modified any observed BDNF-related cognitive trajectories. RESULTS: Compared to BDNF Val/Val homozygotes, Met carriers showed steeper decline in verbal learning and memory (p = 0.002) and speed and flexibility (p = 0.017). In addition, Abeta burden moderated the relationship between BDNF and verbal learning and memory such that Met carriers with greater Abeta burden showed even steeper cognitive decline (p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: In a middle-aged cohort with AD risk, carriage of the BDNF Met allele was associated with steeper decline in episodic memory and executive function. This decline was exacerbated by greater Abeta burden. These results suggest that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism may play an important role in cognitive decline and could be considered as a target for novel AD therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Our recent studies show that the single Tyr residue in the sequence of amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42) is reactive toward various ligands, including metals and adenosine trisphospate (see: Coskuner , O. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2016 , 21 , 957 - 973 and Coskuner , O. ; Murray , I. V. J. J. Alzheimer's Dis. 2014 , 41 , 561 - 574 ). However, the exact role of Tyr in the structures of Abeta42 remains unknown. To fill this gap, here we analyzed the role of Tyr and the impact of the Tyr10Ala mutation on the structural ensemble of Abeta42. beta-Sheet formation in the structural ensemble of Abeta42 is directly associated with the reactivity of this peptide toward ligand-receptor interactions, including self-assembly. On the basis of our findings, Tyr plays a crucial role in beta-sheet emergence in the structures of Abeta42, and the Tyr10Ala mutation greatly suppresses or diminishes beta-sheet formation in the overall structures of monomeric Abeta42. A new strategy for predicting the degree of stability and an \"order in disorder\" algorithm using secondary structure properties and thermodynamics were developed and applied for the Tyr10Ala mutant and wild-type Abeta42 analysis. This new clustering algorithm may help in selecting disordered protein structure ensembles for drug design studies. Tyr10Ala mutation results in less stable and less compact structures, a conclusion based on our varying thermodynamic studies using harmonic and quasi-harmonic methods. Furthermore, the use of various intrinsic disorder predictors suggests that the Tyr10Ala mutation impacts the Abeta42 propensity for disorder, whereas the application of several computational tools for aggregation prediction suggests that this mutation decreases the Abeta42 aggregation propensity. The mid-domain interactions with the N- and C-terminal regions weaken or disappear upon Tyr10Ala mutation. In addition, the N- and C-terminal interactions are weaker or diminished upon the introduction of the Tyr10Ala mutation to the structures of the Abeta42 peptide in solution.",

Herein, we show how a class of bio-conjugates takes advantage of the antiaggregating, antioxidant and antiglycating properties of trehalose and carnosine.

    "abstract": "Alteration of ryanodine receptor (RyR)-mediated calcium (Ca2+) signaling has been reported in Alzheimer disease (AD) models. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying altered RyR-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release in AD remain to be fully elucidated. We report here that RyR2 undergoes post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, oxidation, and nitrosylation) in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells expressing the beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) harboring the familial double Swedish mutations (APPswe). RyR2 macromolecular complex remodeling, characterized by depletion of the regulatory protein calstabin2, resulted in increased cytosolic Ca2+ levels and mitochondrial oxidative stress. We also report a functional interplay between amyloid beta (Abeta), beta-adrenergic signaling, and altered Ca2+ signaling via leaky RyR2 channels. Thus, post-translational modifications of RyR occur downstream of Abeta through a beta2-adrenergic signaling cascade that activates PKA. RyR2 remodeling in turn enhances betaAPP processing. Importantly, pharmacological stabilization of the binding of calstabin2 to RyR2 channels, which prevents Ca2+ leakage, or blocking the beta2-adrenergic signaling cascade reduced betaAPP processing and the production of Abeta in APPswe-expressing SH-SY5Y cells. We conclude that targeting RyR-mediated Ca2+ leakage may be a therapeutic approach to treat AD.",

    "abstract": "Clearance of amyloid-beta (Abeta) from the brain is an important therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Current studies mainly focus on the central approach of Abeta clearance by introducing therapeutic agents into the brain. In a previous study, we found that peripheral tissues and organs play important roles in clearing brain-derived Abeta, suggesting that the peripheral approach of removing Abeta from the blood may also be effective for AD therapy. Here, we investigated whether peritoneal dialysis, a clinically available therapeutic method for chronic kidney disease (CKD), reduces brain Abeta burden and attenuates AD-type pathologies and cognitive impairments. Thirty patients with newly diagnosed CKD were enrolled. The plasma Abeta concentrations of the patients were measured before and after peritoneal dialysis. APP/PS1 mice were subjected to peritoneal dialysis once a day for 1 month from 6 months of age (prevention study) or 9 months of age (treatment study). The Abeta in the interstitial fluid (ISF) was collected using microdialysis. Behavioural performance, long-term potentiation (LTP), Abeta burden and other AD-type pathologies were measured after 1 month of peritoneal dialysis. Peritoneal dialysis significantly reduced plasma Abeta levels in both CKD patients and APP/PS1 mice. Abeta levels in the brain ISF of APP/PS1 mice immediately decreased after reduction of Abeta in the blood during peritoneal dialysis. In both prevention and treatment studies, peritoneal dialysis substantially reduced Abeta deposition, attenuated other AD-type pathologies, including Tau hyperphosphorylation, glial activation, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and synaptic dysfunction, and rescued the behavioural deficits of APPswe/PS1 mice. Importantly, the Abeta phagocytosis function of microglia was enhanced in APP/PS1 mice after peritoneal dialysis. Our study suggests that peritoneal dialysis is a promising therapeutic method for AD, and Abeta clearance using a peripheral approach could be a desirable therapeutic strategy for AD.",

Inflammation is frequently related to AD, whereas microglial cells are the major phagocytes in the brain and mediate the removal of Abeta peptides. Microglial cell dsyregulation might contribute to the formation of amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD. Genome-wide association studies have reported genetic loci associated with the inflammatory pathway involved in AD. Among them, rs3865444 CD33, rs3764650 ABCA7, rs6656401 CR1, and rs610932 MS4A6A variants in microglial genes are associated with LOAD. These variants are proposed to participate in the clearance of Abeta peptides. However, their association with LOAD was not validated in all case-control studies. Thus, the present work aimed to assess the involvement of CD33 (rs3865444), ABCA7 (rs3764650), CR1 (rs6656401), and MS4A6A (rs610932) with LOAD in a sample from southeastern Brazil. The genotype frequencies were assessed in 79 AD patients and 145 healthy elders matched for sex and age. We found that rs3865444 CD33 acts as a protective factor against LOAD. These results support a role for the inflammatory pathway in LOAD.",

Therefore, the inhibition of Abeta assembly is considered as the primary target for AD therapy. In this study, we reported that fucoxanthin, a marine carotenoid, potently reduced the formation of Abeta fibrils and oligomers. Moreover, the fucoxanthin-triggered modification significantly reduced the neurotoxicity of Abeta oligomers in vitro. Molecular dynamics simulation analysis further revealed a hydrophobic interaction between fucoxanthin and Abeta peptide, which might prevent the conformational transition and self-assembly of Abeta. Most importantly, fucoxanthin could attenuate cognitive impairments in Abeta oligomer-injected mice. In addition, fucoxanthin significantly inhibited oxidative stress, enhanced the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and increased ChAT-positive regions in the hippocampus of mice. On the basis of these novel findings, we anticipated that fucoxanthin might ameliorate AD via inhibiting Abeta assembly and attenuating Abeta neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent unmet need for new therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Therapeutic approaches targeting amyloid-beta (Abeta) and its downstream toxicities have become major strategies in AD drug development. We have taken a rational design approach and synthesized a class of tricyclic pyrone (TP) compounds that show anti-Abeta and other neuroprotective actions. The in vivo efficacy of a lead TP named CP2 to ameliorate AD-like pathologies has been shown in mouse models. Here we report the selection and initial characterization of a new lead TP70, which exhibited an anti-Abeta therapeutic index even higher than CP2. Moreover, TP70 was able to reduce oxidative stress, inhibit acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), and upregulate the expression of ATP-binding cassette subfamily A, member 1 (ABCA1), actions considered neuroprotective in AD. TP70 further showed excellent pharmacokinetic properties, including brain penetration and oral availability. When administered to 5xFAD mice via intraperitoneal or oral route, TP70 enhanced the overall solubility and decreased the level of cerebral Abeta, including both fibrillary and soluble Abeta species. Interestingly, TP70 enhanced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) in the hippocampal CA1 area, increased the magnitude of NMDA-dependent hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular model of learning and memory, and prevented the Abeta oligomer-impaired LTP. Significantly, a single dose of TP70 administered to aged 5xFAD mice was effective in mitigating the impaired LTP induction, recorded at 24 h after administration. Our results support a potential of TP70 in clinical development for AD in view of its synergistic neuroprotective actions, ability to positively modulate NMDA receptor-mediated hippocampal plasticity, and favorable pharmacokinetic properties in rodents.",

    "abstract": "Primary memory impairments associated with increased level of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain have been shown to be linked, partially, with early pathological changes in the entorhinal cortex (EC) which spread on the whole limbic system. While the hippocampus is known to play a key role in learning and memory mechanisms, it is as yet unclear how its structures are involved in the EC pathology. In this study, changes in memory and neuronal morphology in male Wistar rats intrahippocampally injected with Abeta25-35 were correlated on days 14 and 45 after the injection to reveal specific cognitive-structural associations. The main focus was on the dentate gyrus (DG) and hippocampal areas of CA1 and CA3 because of their involvement in afferent flows from EC to the hippocampus through tri-synaptic (EC   DG   CA3   CA1) and/or mono-synaptic (EC   CA1) pathways. Evident memory impairments were observed at both time points after Abeta25-35 injection. However, on day 14, populations of morphological intact neurons were decreased in CA3 and, drastically, in CA1, and the DG supramedial bundle was significantly damaged. On day 45, this bundle largely and CA1 neurons partially recovered, whereas CA3 neurons remained damaged. We suggest that Abeta25-35 primarily affects the tri-synaptic pathway, destroying the granular cells in the DG supramedial area and neurons in CA3 and, through the Schaffer collaterals, in CA1. Intrahippocampal pretreatment with hydrated fullerene C60 allows the neurons and their connections to survive the amyloidosis, thus supporting the memory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology and intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) interact. Across stages of AD, we expected individual spatial correspondence of Abeta and iFC to reveal both Abeta accumulation and its detrimental effects on iFC. We used resting-state functional magnetic imaging and Abeta imaging in a cross-sectional sample of 90 subjects across stages of AD and healthy older adults. Global and local correspondence of Abeta and iFC were assessed within the posterior default mode network (pDMN) by within-subject voxel-wise correlations. Beginning at preclinical stages, global Abeta-iFC correspondence was positive for the whole pDMN, showing that Abeta accumulates in areas of high connectivity, and reached a plateau at prodromal stages. Starting at preclinical stages, local correspondence was negative in network centers, indicating that Abeta reduces connectivity of the pDMN as a function of local plaque concentration, and peaked at prodromal stages. Positive global correspondence suggests that Abeta accumulation progresses along iFC, with this effect starting in preclinical stages, and being constant along clinical periods. Negative local correspondence suggests detrimental effects of Abeta on iFC in network centers, starting at preclinical stages, and peaking when first symptoms appear. Data reveal a complex trajectory of Abeta and iFC correspondence, affecting both Abeta accumulation and iFC impairments.",

    "abstract": "Aggregates composed of the microtubule associated protein, tau, are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's tauopathies. Extracellular tau can induce the accumulation and aggregation of intracellular tau, and tau pathology can be transmitted along neural networks over time. There are six splice variants of central nervous system tau, and various oligomeric and fibrillar forms are associated with neurodegeneration in vivo. The particular extracellular forms of tau capable of transferring tau pathology from neuron to neuron remain ill defined, however, as do the consequences of intracellular tau aggregation on neuronal physiology. The present study was undertaken to compare the effects of extracellular tau monomers, oligomers, and filaments comprising various tau isoforms on the behavior of cultured neurons. We found that 2N4R or 2N3R tau oligomers provoked aggregation of endogenous intracellular tau much more effectively than monomers or fibrils, or of oligomers made from other tau isoforms, and that a mixture of all six isoforms most potently provoked intracellular tau accumulation. These effects were associated with invasion of tau into the somatodendritic compartment. Finally, we observed that 2N4R oligomers perturbed fast axonal transport of membranous organelles along microtubules. Intracellular tau accumulation was often accompanied by increases in the run length, run time and instantaneous velocity of membranous cargo. This work indicates that extracellular tau oligomers can disrupt normal neuronal homeostasis by triggering axonal tau accumulation and loss of the polarized distribution of tau, and by impairing fast axonal transport.",

    "title": "Insights into Formation and Structure of Abeta Oligomers Cross-Linked via Tyrosines.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is hypothesized to be triggered by amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) assembly into oligomers. Oligomer size distributions of both predominant Abeta alloforms, Abeta40 and Abeta42, can be determined in vitro using cross-linking followed by gel electrophoresis. Cross-linking, which can occur in vivo in the presence of copper and hydrogen peroxide, was recently shown to stabilize Abeta oligomers by inhibiting their conversion into fibrils. Whereas several studies showed that cross-linking is facilitated by dityrosine bond formation, the molecular-level mechanism of cross-linking remains unclear. Here, we use efficient discrete molecular dynamics with DMD4B-HYDRA force field to examine the effect of cross-linking via tyrosines on Abeta oligomer formation. Our results show that cross-linking via tyrosines promotes Abeta self-assembly, in particular that of Abeta40, but does not account for cross-linked oligomers larger than Abeta40 trimers and Abeta42 tetramers. Cross-linking via tyrosines profoundly alters Abeta40 and Abeta42 oligomer conformations by increasing the solvent exposure of hydrophobic residues, resulting in elongated oligomeric morphologies that differ from globular structures of noncross-linked oligomers. When compared to available experimental data, our findings imply that amino acids other than tyrosines are involved in Abeta cross-linking, a proposition that is currently under investigation.",

    "abstract": "Heritability, defined as the proportion of phenotypic variation attributable to genetic variation, provides important information about the genetic basis of a trait. Existing heritability analysis methods do not discriminate between stable effects (e.g., due to the subject's unique environment) and transient effects, such as measurement error. This can lead to misleading assessments, particularly when comparing the heritability of traits that exhibit different levels of reliability. Here, we present a linear mixed effects model to conduct heritability analyses that explicitly accounts for intrasubject fluctuations (e.g., due to measurement noise or biological transients) using repeat measurements. We apply the proposed strategy to the analysis of resting-state fMRI measurements-a prototypic data modality that exhibits variable levels of test-retest reliability across space. Our results reveal that the stable components of functional connectivity within and across well-established large-scale brain networks can be considerably heritable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dissociating intra- and intersubject variation can reveal genetic influence on a phenotype that is not fully captured by conventional heritability analyses.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) stems from the inter-relation of multiple pathological factors upon initiation and progression of the disease. To identify the involvement of metal-bound amyloid-beta (metal-Abeta) aggregation in AD pathology, among the pathogenic features found in the AD-affected brain, small molecules as chemical tools capable of controlling metal-Abeta aggregation were developed. Herein, we report a new class of 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) derivatives (1-4) rationally designed to be chemical modulators toward metal-Abeta aggregation over metal-free Abeta analogue. The bpy derivatives were constructed through a rational design strategy employing straightforward structural variations onto the backbone of a metal chelator, bpy: (i) incorporation of an Abeta interacting moiety; (ii) introduction of a methyl group at different positions. The newly prepared bpy derivatives were observed to bind to metal ions [i.e., Cu(II) and Zn(II)] and interact with metal-Abeta over metal-free Abeta to varying degrees. Distinguishable from bpy, the bpy derivatives (1-3) were indicated to noticeably modulate the aggregation pathways of Cu(II)-Abeta and Zn(II)-Abeta over metal-free Abeta. Overall, our studies of the bpy derivatives demonstrate that the alteration of metal binding properties as well as the installation of an Abeta interacting capability onto a metal chelating framework, devised via the rational structure-based design, were able to achieve evident modulating reactivity against metal-Abeta aggregation. Obviating the need for complicated structures, our design approach, presented in this work, could be appropriately utilized for inventing small molecules as chemical tools for studying desired metal-related targets in biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Cystatin C (CysC) is a versatile and ubiquitously-expressed member of the cysteine protease inhibitor family that is present at notably high concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid. Under mildly denaturing conditions, CysC forms inactive domain-swapped dimers. A destabilizing mutation, L68Q, increases the rate of domain-swapping and causes a fatal amyloid disease, hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy. Wild-type (wt) CysC will also aggregate into amyloid fibrils under some conditions. Propagated domain-swapping has been proposed as the mechanism by which CysC fibrils grow. We present evidence that a CysC mutant, V57N, stabilized against domain-swapping, readily forms fibrils, contradicting the propagated domain-swapping hypothesis. Furthermore, in physiological buffer, wt CysC can form oligomers without undergoing domain-swapping. These non-swapped oligomers are identical in secondary structure to CysC monomers and completely retain protease inhibitory activity. However, unlike monomers or dimers, the oligomers bind fluorescent dyes that indicate they have characteristics of pre-amyloid aggregates. Although these oligomers appear to be a pre-amyloid assembly, they are slower than CysC monomers to form fibrils. Fibrillation of CysC therefore likely initiates from the monomer and does not require domain-swapping. The non-swapped oligomers likely represent a dead-end offshoot of the amyloid pathway and must dissociate to monomers prior to rearranging to amyloid fibrils. These prefibrillar CysC oligomers were potent inhibitors of aggregation of the Alzheimer's-related peptide, beta-amyloid. This result illustrates an example where heterotypic interactions between pre-amyloid oligomers prevent the homotypic interactions that would lead to mature amyloid fibrils.",

In this work, we compare the effects of two different species derived from synthetic Abeta1-42 and prepared without HFIP (Abeta) or using HFIP (Abeta/HFIP) on the glycine-activated chloride current (IGly). The experiments were conducted on the pyramidal neurons isolated from CA3 region of rat hippocampus. Transmembrane currents were recorded using a conventional patch-clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration. The IGly was induced by a step application of the agonist for 600 ms through glass capillary. Abeta or Abeta/HFIP was coapplied with glycine. The effects of the two species of the peptide have similar and distinctive features. Both substances caused a reduction in the peak amplitude and an acceleration of desensitization of the IGly. At the same time, the effect of Abeta/HFIP was found to develop and recover more slowly and required several repeated applications for its saturation (use dependence). The effect of Abeta/HFIP was voltage independent and equally pronounced at negative and positive membrane potentials. First, our results confirm that HFIP pretreatment may influence the properties of Abeta. Second, new information on the glycine receptor ability to interact with drugs in use-dependent mode was obtained.",

Platinum coordination is found to depend on the nature of the ligand, providing evidence that binding mode may be controlled by suitable ligand design. Boltzmann populations at 310K indicate that each Pt-Abeta complex has a small number of thermodynamically accessible states.

Curcumin has been reported to display anti-amyloidogenic activity, not only by inhibiting the formation of new Abeta aggregates, but also by disaggregating existing ones. However, the uptake of Curcumin into the brain is severely restricted by its low ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, novel strategies for a targeted delivery of Curcumin into the brain are highly desired. Here, we encapsulated Curcumin as active ingredient in PLGA (polylactide-co-glycolic-acid) nanoparticles (NPs), modified with g7 ligand for BBB crossing. We performed in depth analyses of possible toxicity of these NPs, uptake, and, foremost, their ability to influence Abeta pathology in vitro using primary hippocampal cell cultures. Our results show no apparent toxicity of the formulated NPs, but a significant decrease of Abeta aggregates in response to Curcumin loaded NPs. We thus conclude that brain delivery of Curcumin using BBB crossing NPs is a promising future approach in the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The aggregation of Abeta peptides, Abeta1-42 in particular, is thought to be a fundamental pathogenic mechanism leading to the neuronal damage in AD. Recently, monosialoganglioside GM1 is reported to possess pivotal neuroprotection in neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have focused on the conformational dynamics and the biochemical interaction of the amyloid-peptide with the GM1 ganglioside, as well as the protective effect of GM1 on cognition. However, the phenomenon of autophagy with regard to neuronal dysfunction in AD is less investigated. In the present study, GM1 treatment were investigated in an AD mouse model and cultured PC12 dells to examine cognition-protective and neuroprotective effects of GM1. Furthermore, GM1 was found to induce autophagy via testing light chain 3 (LC3), Beclin1, neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1 protein and p62 (a substrate of LC3). Chloroquine, an inhibitor of lysosomal, was used to exclude the interference of lysosome, which could fuse with autophagosome and then clear it. In the presence of the inhibitor of autophagy (3-methyladenine; 3-MA), the protective effect of GM1 on PC12 cells in Abeta (1-42) induced toxic conditions was diminished. Interestingly, the expression of histone deacetylase 1 was increased in PC12 cells when treated with GM1, indicating that autophagy might be activated by GM1 through a pathway integrates protein acetylation. This study provides a novel insight into the protective role of GM1 against Abeta (1-42)-induced neurotoxicity via enhancing autophagy.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Kunitz proteinase inhibitor (KPI) domain-containing forms of the amyloid beta-protein precursor (AbetaPP) inhibit cerebral thrombosis. KPI domain-lacking forms of AbetaPP are abundant in brain. Regions of AbetaPP other than the KPI domain may also be involved with regulating cerebral thrombosis. To determine the contribution of the KPI domain to the overall function of AbetaPP in regulating cerebral thrombosis we generated a reactive center mutant that was devoid of anti-thrombotic activity and studied its anti-thrombotic function in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: To determine the extent of KPI function of AbetaPP in regulating cerebral thrombosis we generated a recombinant reactive center KPIR13I mutant devoid of anti-thrombotic activity. The anti-proteolytic and anti-coagulant properties of wild-type and R13I mutant KPI were investigated in vitro. Cerebral thrombosis of wild-type, AbetaPP knock out and AbetaPP/KPIR13I mutant mice was evaluated in experimental models of carotid artery thrombosis and intracerebral hemorrhage. RESULTS: Recombinant mutant KPIR13I domain was ineffective in the inhibition of pro-thrombotic proteinases and did not inhibit the clotting of plasma in vitro. AbetaPP/KPIR13I mutant mice were similarly deficient as AbetaPP knock out mice in regulating cerebral thrombosis in experimental models of carotid artery thrombosis and intracerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the anti-thrombotic function of AbetaPP primarily resides in the KPI activity of the protein.",

    "abstract": "Chitinase activity is increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of chitinase1 in AD is unknown. We investigated the effects of chitinase1 on Alzheimer's pathology and microglia function. Artificial chitinase1 and chitinase inhibitor (chitinase-IN-2) were used to determine the effects of chitinase1 on inflammatory factors and beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers deposition in D-galactose/AlCl3-induced rat model with cognitive impairments. Abeta-treated N9 microglia cells were analyzed to further verify whether the changes in inflammatory factors following chitinase1 treatment were associated with microglia alternative activation. Our data displayed that the activity of chitinase1 was both improved in D-galactose/AlCl3-injected rats and Abeta-pretreated microglia. Moreover, there was an improvement in cognitive function in chitinase1-treated AD rats. Furthermore, anti-inflammation factors (Arginase 1, Arg-1, mannose receptor type C 1, MRC1/CD206) were increased and pro-inflammation factors (tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNFalpha, interleukin 1 beta, IL-1beta) were decreased in D-galactose/AlCl3-induced AD rats with chitinase1 treatment. A higher level of M2 markers (Arg-1, MRC1/CD206) and a lower level of classic M1 markers (TNFa, IL-1beta) were obtained in Abeta-pretreated N9 cells with chitinase1, suggesting that chitinase1 polarized the microglia into an anti-AD M2 phenotype. We also detected that chitnase1 could weaken the deposition of Abeta oligomers in the brain of D-galactose/ AlCl3-induced AD rats. In conclusion, Chitinase1 might exert protective effects against AD by polarizing microglia to an M2 phenotype and resisting Abeta oligomer deposition.",

    "abstract": "A sensitive and stable bioassay for the detection of Abeta oligomer (Abetao), a potentially promising candidate biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, was developed using Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as the recognition and concentration elements and BaYF5:Yb,Er upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as highly sensitive labels, conjugated with the Abetao aptamer (DNA1) and the complementary oligonucleotide of the Abetao aptamer (DNA2), respectively. The DNA1 hybridized with DNA2 to form the duplex structure on the surface of the MNPs/UCNPs nanocomposites probe. When the target Abetao was introduced, the aptamer DNA1 preferentially bound with Abetao and caused the dissociation of some complementary DNA2, liberating some UCNP-labeled complementary DNA2 and leading to a decreased upconversion fluorescent intensity on the surface of MNPs. The decreased fluorescence intensity of UCNPs was related to the concentration of Abetao in the range of 0.2-15nM with a detection limit of 36 pM. The developed method then was successfully applied to measure Abetao in artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Benefiting from the magnetic separation and concentration effect of MNPs, the high sensitivity of UCNPs, as well as the selectivity and stability of the aptamer, the present strategy offered valuable information related to early diagnosis of AD process.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a growing concern in the context of the increasing lifespan of the populations. The work presented here is part of the fight against this threat. It supports a therapeutic approach to reduce the incidence of Alzheimer's disease, taking advantage of the specific binding of several domains of Netrin-1 to the beta-amyloid precursor protein. This basic knowledge shall then be used to predict, design or characterize lead compounds that may in turn inhibit/delay Alzheimer's disease's progression, extending the therapeutic offer of the other leads already being investigated in this line. The present work is focused on the interaction of the various portions of APP with the three domains of Netrin-1, the so-called LamNT, EGF-like and NTR domains respectively. It reveals in detail which portions of APP and Netrin-1 are specifically involved in these interactions, using ELISA technique in combination with protein-protein binding simulations. So far unsuspected interaction sites located in Netrin-1 EGF-like and NTR domains open possibilities for new therapeutic approaches in which these sites will be specifically targeted.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease which is clinically characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline caused by protein misfolding and aggregation. Imbalance between free radicals and the antioxidant system is a prominent and early feature in the neuropathology of AD. Selenium (Se), a vital trace element with excellent antioxidant potential, is preferentially retained in the brain in Se-limited conditions and has been reported to provide neuroprotection through resisting oxidative damage. In this paper, we studied for the first time the potential of Ebselen, a lipid-soluble selenium compound with GPx-like activity, in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction and neuropathology of triple-transgenic AD (3 x Tg-AD) mice, AD model cell, and primary culture. We demonstrated that Ebselen inhibited oxidative stress in both AD model cells and mouse brains with increasing GPx and SOD activities and meanwhile reduced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases activities. By decreasing the expression of amyloid precursor protein and beta-secretase, Ebselen reduced the levels of Abeta in AD neurons and mouse brains, especially the most toxic oligomeric form. Besides, mislocation of phosphorylated tau in neurons and phosphorylation levels of tau protein at Thr231, Ser396, and Ser404 residues were also inhibited by Ebselen, probably by its regulatory roles in glycogen synthase kinase 3beta and protein phosphatase 2A activity. In addition, Ebselen mitigated the decrease of synaptic proteins including synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95 in AD model cells and neurons. Consequently, the spatial learning and memory of 3 x Tg-AD mice were significantly improved upon Ebselen treatment. This study provides a potential novel therapeutic approach for the prevention of AD.",

Those mutations had opposite effects on the onset and progression of Alzheimer disease, the former inducing early AD pathology and the latter protecting against the onset of the disease. We applied Static and Dynamic Light Scattering and Circular Dichroism, to study the different mutants in the early stages of the aggregation process, essential for the disease. Comparative results showed that the aggregation pathways differ in the kinetics and extent of the process, in the size of the aggregates and in the evolution of the secondary structure, resulting in fibrils of different morphology, as seen by AFM. Mutated peptides had comparable toxic effects on N2a cells. Moreover, as assessed by X-ray scattering, all of them displayed disordering effects on the internal structure of mixed phospholipids-gangliosides model membranes.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of amyloid beta protein (Abeta)-containing neuritic plaques in the brain is a neuropathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is essential for Abeta generation and dysregulation of BACE1 expression may lead to AD pathogenesis. Bcl-2-associated athanogen 1M (BAG-1M), initially identified as an anti-apoptotic protein, has also been found to be highly expressed in the same neurons that contain intracellular amyloid in the hippocampus of AD patient. In this report, we found that over-expression of BAG-1M enhances BACE1-mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Abeta production by up-regulating BACE1 gene transcription. The regulation of BACE1 transcription by BAG-1M was dependent on NF-kappaB, as BAG-1M complexes NF-kappaB at the promoter of BACE1 gene and co-activates NF-kappaB-facilitated BACE1 transcription. Moreover, expression of BAG-1M by lentiviral vector in the hippocampus of AD transgenic model mice promotes Abeta generation and formation of neuritic plaque, and subsequently accelerates memory deficits of the mice. These results provide evidence for an emerging role of BAG-1M in the regulation of BACE1 expression and AD pathogenesis and that targeting the BAG-1M-NF-kappaB complex may provide a mechanism for inhibiting Abeta production and plaque formation.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates that the activation of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), a first and rate-limiting enzyme in the kynurenine (KYN) pathway, is involved in amyloid-beta (Abeta1-42)-neurotoxicity and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Physical exercise has been considered an effective intervention in AD, attenuating or limiting their progression. Nevertheless, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of exercise have not yet been fully elucidated. In present study, we investigated the protective effect of an 8-week swimming training (ST) exercise on cognitive and non-cognitive functions and its role in modulating biomarkers of KYN pathway, before an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of Abeta1-42 (400pmol/animal; 3mul/site) peptide in mice. Our results demonstrated that ST was effective in preventing the following behavioural disturbances caused by Abeta1-42 injection: memory impairment in the object recognition test and depressive/anxiety-like behaviour in the tail suspension test and elevated plus-maze test, respectively. ST abrogated the neuroinflammatory response and neurotrophic deficiency in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus induced by Abeta1-42. Also, Abeta1-42 increased IDO activity, KYN and tryptophan (TRP) levels and KYN:TRP ratio in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus - alterations that were blocked by ST. It can be concluded that ST prevented behavioural and neurobiological deficits induced by Abeta1-42, and suggest that these neuroprotective effects are likely to involve the inhibition of inflammation/IDO activation and up-regulation of neurotrophic factors in brain of mice. Thus, it is possible that physical exercise can be used as a non-pharmacological approach to alleviates both cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms of AD.",

Since neuroinflammation has been shown to be involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) development and progression, the aim of this study was to examine the anti-inflammatory role of RAPA in AD in vivo and in vitro, and investigate the underlying mechanisms. We found that amyloid-beta (Abeta) induced neuronal inflammation and a remarkable increase in mTOR activity in in-vivo and in-vitro models of inflammation, suggesting the critical role of mTOR signaling in neuronal inflammation. In addition, administration of RAPA was found to down-regulate mTOR, p-mTOR, Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) p65, p-p65, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and Bax protein expression in Abeta25-35- or lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-treated mice and cultured Neuro-2a (N2a) cells. Moreover, RAPA disrupted Abeta25-35-induced nuclear translocation of mTOR and NF-kappaB. Our findings indicate that RAPA inhibits Abeta25-35- or LPS-induced neuronal inflammation through suppressing mTOR signaling and reducing nuclear import of NF-kappaB.",

    "abstract": "Importance: To our knowledge, a comprehensive study of the survival and causes of death of persons with synucleinopathies compared with the general population has not been conducted. Understanding the long-term outcomes of these conditions may inform patients and caregivers of the expected disease duration and may help with care planning. Objective: To compare survival rates and causes of death among patients with incident, clinically diagnosed synucleinopathies and age- and sex-matched referent participants. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based study used the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records-linkage system to identify all residents in Olmsted County, Minnesota, who received a diagnostic code of parkinsonism from 1991 through 2010. A movement-disorders specialist reviewed the medical records of each individual to confirm the presence of parkinsonism and determine the type of synucleinopathy. For each confirmed patient, an age- and sex-matched Olmsted County resident without parkinsonism was also identified. Main Outcomes and Measures: We determined the age- and sex-adjusted risk of death for each type of synucleinopathy, the median time from diagnosis to death, and the causes of death. Results: Of the 461 patients with synucleinopathies, 279 (60.5%) were men, and of the 452 referent participants, 272 (60.2%) were men. From 1991 through 2010, 461 individuals received a diagnosis of a synucleinopathy (309 [67%] of Parkinson disease, 81 [17.6%] of dementia with Lewy bodies, 55 [11.9%] of Parkinson disease dementia, and 16 [3.5%] of multiple system atrophy with parkinsonism). During follow-up, 68.6% (n = 316) of the patients with synucleinopathies and 48.7% (n = 220) of the referent participants died. Patients with any synucleinopathy died a median of 2 years earlier than referent participants. Patients with multiple system atrophy with parkinsonism (hazard ratio, 10.51; 95% CI, 2.92-37.82) had the highest risk of death compared with referent participants, followed by those with dementia with Lewy bodies (hazard ratio, 3.94; 95% CI, 2.61-5.94), Parkinson disease with dementia (hazard ratio, 3.86; 95% CI, 2.36-6.30), and Parkinson disease (hazard ratio, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.39-2.21). Neurodegenerative disease was the most frequent cause of death listed on the death certificate for patients, and cardiovascular disease was the most frequent cause of death among referent participants. Conclusions and Relevance: Individuals with multiple system atrophy with parkinsonism, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson disease dementia have increased mortality compared with the general population. The mortality among persons with Parkinson disease is only moderately increased compared with the general population.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid deposition occurs in aging, even in individuals free from cognitive symptoms, and is often interpreted as preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. YKL-40 is a marker of neuroinflammation, being increased in AD, and hypothesized to interact with amyloid-beta (Abeta) in causing cognitive decline early in the cascade of AD pathophysiology. Whether and how Abeta and YKL-40 affect brain and cognitive changes in cognitively healthy older adults is still unknown. We studied 89 participants (mean age: 73.1 years) with cerebrospinal fluid samples at baseline, and both MRI and cognitive assessments from two time-points separated by two years. We tested how baseline levels of Abeta42 and YKL-40 correlated with changes in cortical thickness and cognition. Thickness change correlated with Abeta42 only in Abeta42+ participants (<600 pg/mL, n = 27) in the left motor and premotor cortices. Abeta42 was unrelated to cognitive change. Increased YKL-40 was associated with less preservation of scores on the animal naming test in the total sample (r = -0.28, p = 0.012) and less preservation of a score reflecting global cognitive function for Abeta42+ participants (r = -0.58, p = 0.004). Our results suggest a role for inflammation in brain atrophy and cognitive changes in cognitively normal older adults, which partly depended on Abeta accumulation.",

    "title": "Amyloid is essential but insufficient for Alzheimer causation: addition of subcellular cofactors is required for dementia.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the hypotheses stating the importance of amyloid or of its oligomers in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Published studies were examined. RESULTS: The importance of amyloid in the pathogenesis of AD is well established, yet accepting it as the main cause for AD is problematic, because amyloid-centric treatments have provided no clinical benefit and about one-third of cognitively normal, older persons have cerebral amyloid plaques. Also problematic is the alternative hypothesis that, instead of amyloid plaques, it is oligomers of amyloid precursor protein that cause AD.Evidence is presented suggesting amyloid/oligomers as necessary but insufficient causes of the dementia and that, for dementia to develop, requires the addition of cofactors known to be associated with AD. Those cofactors include several subcellular processes: mitochondrial impairments; the Wnt signaling system; the unfolded protein response; the ubiquitin proteasome system; the Notch signaling system; and tau, calcium, and oxidative damage. CONCLUSIONS: A modified amyloid/oligomer hypothesis for the pathogenesis of AD is that activation of one or more of the aforementioned cofactors creates a burden of functional impairments that, in conjunction with amyloid/oligomers, now crosses a threshold of dysfunction that results in clinical dementia. Of considerable importance, several treatments that might reverse the activation of some of the subcellular processes are available, for example, lithium, pioglitazone, erythropoietin, and prazosin; they should be given in combination in a clinical trial to test their safety and efficacy.   2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

In addition, the bioactivities of its total flavonoids-breviscapine included inhibiting amyloid beta (Abeta) fibril formation, antioxidation and metal chelating, which are beneficial to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, A HPLC-QTOF-MS based plasma metabonomics approach was applied to investigate the neuroprotective effects of breviscapine on intracerebroventricular injection of aggregated Abeta 1-42 induced AD mice for the first time in the study. Ten potential biomarkers were screened out by multivariate statistical analysis, eight of which were further identified as indoleacrylic acid, C16 sphinganine, LPE (22:6), sulfolithocholic acid, LPC (16:0), PA (22:1/0:0), taurodeoxycholic acid, and PC (0:0/18:0).

There is considerable structural diversity possible within this compound class and large regions of potentially biologically relevant biflavonoid chemical space remain untapped or underexplored. Herein, we report the development of a modular and divergent strategy towards biflavonoid derivatives which enabled the step-economical preparation of a structurally diverse collection of novel unnatural biflavonoids. Preliminary studies established that the strategy could also be successfully extended to the preparation of very rare triflavonoids, which are also expected to be useful tools for biological intervention. Prompted by previous inhibitory studies with flavonoid libraries, amyloid anti-aggregation screening was performed, which led to the identification of several structurally novel inhibitors of the aggregation of the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta42). Aggregated Abeta42 is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and the use of small molecules to inhibit the aggregation process has been identified as a potentially valuable therapeutic strategy for disease treatment. Methylated biaurones were associated with highest levels of potency (the most active compound had an IC50 value of 16 muM), establishing this scaffold as a starting point for inhibitor development.",

    "title": "Hippocampal overexpression of Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice.",
    "abstract": "Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) is located within the Down syndrome critical region of chromosome 21. DSCAM is a broadly expressed neurodevelopmental protein involved in synaptogenesis, neurite outgrowth, and axon guidance. We previously demonstrated DSCAM overexpression in the cortex of amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice, suggesting possible regulatory interactions between APP and DSCAM. APP mice exhibit deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. In this preliminary study, we examined age-related changes in DSCAM expression within the hippocampus in 16 APP transgenic mice (1, 3, 6 and 12 months old). Hippocampus-dependent spatial memory was assessed in APP mice and age-matched wild type littermates (WTs) using the Morris water maze (MWM). The cellular distribution of hippocampal DSCAM and total expression at both mRNA and protein levels were measured by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and western blotting, respectively. APP mice exhibited spatial memory deficits in the MWM. Intense DSCAM immunoreactivity was observed in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer and hippocampal stratum pyramidale. Total hippocampal DSCAM mRNA and protein expression levels were substantially higher in APP mice than WTs at 1 and 3 months of age. Expression decreased with age in both groups but remained higher in APP mice. DSCAM is overexpressed in the hippocampus over the first 12 months of life in APP mice, but especially during maturation to adulthood. In conclusion, these results suggest an association between DSCAM and APP mice, which is characterized by neuropathology and behavioral deficits. These results provide some clues for future studies on the role of DSCAM overexpression in the precocious cognitive decline observed in APP transgenic mice.",

    "title": "Endocytic uptake of monomeric amyloid-beta peptides is clathrin- and dynamin-independent and results in selective accumulation of Abeta(1-42) compared to Abeta(1-40).",
    "abstract": "Intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides represent an early pathological feature in Alzheimer's disease. We have therefore utilized flow cytometry and confocal microscopy in combination with endocytosis inhibition to explore the internalisation efficiency and uptake mechanisms of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) monomers in cultured SH-SY5Y cells. We find that both variants are constitutively internalised via endocytosis and that their uptake is proportional to cellular endocytic rate. Moreover, SH-SY5Y cells internalise consistently twice the amount of Abeta(1-42) compared to Abeta(1-40); an imaging-based quantification showed that cells treated with 1 microM peptide for 8 h contained 800,000 peptides of Abeta(1-42) and 400,000 of Abeta(1-40). Both variants co-localised to >90% with lysosomes or other acidic compartments. Dynasore and chlorpromazine endocytosis inhibitors were both found to reduce uptake, particularly of Abeta(1-42). Overexpression of the C-terminal of the clathrin-binding domain of AP180, dynamin2 K44A, or Arf6 Q67L did however not reduce uptake of the Abeta variants. By contrast, perturbation of actin polymerisation and inhibition of macropinocytosis reduced Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) uptake considerably. This study clarifies mechanisms of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) uptake, pinpoints differences between the two variants and highlights a common and putative role of macropinocytosis in the early accumulation of intraneuronal Abeta in AD.",

    "abstract": "(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the most abundant polyphenolic extract in green tea and it has attracted increasing attention for its multiple bioactive effects. However, the mechanisms by which EGCG exerts its neuroprotective actions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are presently lacking. In the present study, a sporadic AD transgenic mouse model known as senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) was used to investigate whether oral administration of EGCG could improve recognition and memory function through reduction of amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau hyperphosphorylation. We also investigated the effects of chronic EGCG treatment on the synaptic dysfunction in the frontal cortex (FC) and the hippocampus (Hip) of AD mice. The results showed that long-term oral consumption of EGCG at a relatively high dose (15 mg/kg) improved memory function in SAMP8 mice in the Y-maze and Morris water maze. The levels of Abeta1-42 and BACE-1 in FC and Hip were significantly reduced by EGCG treatment. EGCG treatment also prevented the hyperphosphorylation of tau and reversed the decreased synaptic protein marker synaptophysin and postsynaptic density protein 95 in FC and Hip of SAMP8 mice. The present study suggests that long-term oral consumption of EGCG ameliorates impairments in spatial learning and memory and rescues the reduction in synaptic proteins observed in an AD mouse model. Thus, EGCG may represent a novel candidate agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) plays a major role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Due to its high toxicity, the 42 amino acid long isoform Abeta42 has become of considerable interest. The Abeta42 monomer is prone to aggregation down to the nanomolar range which makes conventional structural methods such as NMR or X-ray crystallography infeasible. Conformational information, however, will be helpful to understand the different aggregation pathways reported in the literature and will allow to identify potential conditions that favour aggregation-incompetent conformations. In this study, we applied fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to investigate the unfolding of Alexa Fluor 488 labelled monomeric Abeta42 using guanidine hydrochloride as a denaturant. We show that our Abeta42 pre-treatment and the low-nanomolar concentrations, typically used for FCS measurements, strongly favour the presence of monomers. Our results reveal that there is an unfolding/folding behaviour of monomeric Abeta42. The existence of a cooperative unfolding curve suggests the presence of structural elements with a Gibbs free energy of unfolding of about 2.8 kcal/mol.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency of abnormal CSF biomarkers of AD and their predictive value for clinical progression in memory clinic patients with SCD in comparison to patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the same cohort. METHODS: We analyzed prospective data from memory clinic patients of the German Competence Network Dementia cohort with a baseline diagnosis of SCD (n = 82) or MCI (n = 134), distinguished by actuarial neuropsychological MCI criteria (\"Jak-Bondi criteria\"). Risk of clinical progression during 3-year follow-up was evaluated with Cox-Proportional-Hazard models. RESULTS: Prevalence of abnormal values in CSF markers of tau-mediated neurodegeneration (67.8% versus 46.3%) but not of amyloid deposition (40.3% versus 35.4%) was significantly higher in MCI compared to SCD. The rate of incident AD dementia (26.1% versus 12.2%) was also significantly higher in MCI. In SCD, additional 22% progressed to MCI during follow-up. Combined amyloid/tau abnormality was the strongest predictor of clinical progression in both groups. CONCLUSION: High prevalence of biomarker abnormality and clinical progression, together with the predictive value of CSF biomarkers, in memory clinic patients with SCD support the validity and usefulness of this condition as a \"pre-MCI\" at risk stage of AD.",

However, the nature of oligomers and pathways of toxicity are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated structural and functional aspects of highly purified oligomers of a pro-aggregant tau species. METHODS: Purified oligomers of the tau repeat domain were characterized by biophysical and structural methods. Functional aspects were investigated by cellular assays ((3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay of cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase release assay [for cell toxicity], reactive oxygen species production, and calcium assay), combined with analysis of neuronal dendritic spines exposed to oligomers. RESULTS: Purified low-n oligomers are roughly globular, with sizes around 1.6 to 5.4 nm, exhibit an altered conformation, but do not have substantial beta-structure. Treatment of primary neurons with oligomers impairs spine morphology and density, accompanied by increased reactive oxygen species and intracellular calcium, but without affecting cell viability (by (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay of cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase release assay [for cell toxicity]).

We have shown that PS1 regulates Abeta levels by a unique bifunctional mechanism. In addition to its known role as the catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase complex, selective phosphorylation of PS1 on Ser367 decreases Abeta levels by increasing betaCTF degradation through autophagy. Here, we report the molecular mechanism by which PS1 modulates betaCTF degradation. We show that PS1 phosphorylated at Ser367, but not nonphosphorylated PS1, interacts with Annexin A2, which, in turn, interacts with the lysosomal N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) Vamp8. Annexin A2 facilitates the binding of Vamp8 to the autophagosomal SNARE Syntaxin 17 to modulate the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Thus, PS1 phosphorylated at Ser367 has an antiamyloidogenic function, promoting autophagosome-lysosome fusion and increasing betaCTF degradation. Drugs designed to increase the level of PS1 phosphorylated at Ser367 should be useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Bidirectional regulation of Abeta levels by Presenilin 1.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta), which is generated through sequential proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), first by the action of beta-secretase, generating the beta-C-terminal fragment (betaCTF), and then by the Presenilin 1 (PS1) enzyme in the gamma-secretase complex, generating Abeta. gamma-Secretase is an intramembranous protein complex composed of Aph1, Pen2, Nicastrin, and Presenilin 1. Although it has a central role in the pathogenesis of AD, knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate PS1 function is limited. Here, we show that phosphorylation of PS1 at Ser367 does not affect gamma-secretase activity, but has a dramatic effect on Abeta levels in vivo. We identified CK1gamma2 as the endogenous kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of PS1 at Ser367. Inhibition of CK1gamma leads to a decrease in PS1 Ser367 phosphorylation and an increase in Abeta levels in cultured cells. Transgenic mice in which Ser367 of PS1 was mutated to Ala, show dramatic increases in Abeta peptide and in betaCTF levels in vivo. Finally, we show that this mutation impairs the autophagic degradation of betaCTF, resulting in its accumulation and increased levels of Abeta peptide and plaque load in the brain. Our results demonstrate that PS1 regulates Abeta levels by a unique bifunctional mechanism. In addition to its known role as the catalytic subunit of the gamma-secretase complex, selective phosphorylation of PS1 on Ser367 also decreases Abeta levels by increasing betaCTF degradation through autophagy. Elucidation of the mechanism by which PS1 regulates betaCTF degradation may aid in the development of potential therapies for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy has been widely applied to characterize the high-resolution structures of beta-amyloid (Abeta) fibrils. While these structures provide crucial molecular insights on the deposition of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's diseases (AD), ssNMR structures have been rarely used so far as the basis for designing inhibitors. It remains a challenge because the ssNMR-based Abeta fibril structures were usually obtained with sparsely isotope-labeled peptides with limited experimental constraints, where the structural models, especially the side-chain coordinates, showed restricted precision. However, these structural models often possess a higher accuracy within the hydrophobic core regions with more well-defined experimental data, which provide potential targets for the molecular design. This work presents an ssNMR-based molecular design to achieve selective inhibition of a particular type of Abeta fibrillar structure, which was formed with the Iowa mutant of Abeta with parallel-in-register beta-sheet hydrophobic core. The results show that short peptides that mimic the C-terminal beta-strands of the fibril may have a preference in binding to the parallel Abeta fibrils rather than the antiparallel fibrils, mainly due to the differences in the high-resolution structures in the fibril elongation interfaces. The Iowa mutant Abeta fibrils are utilized in this work mainly as a model to demonstrate the feasibility of the strategy because it is relatively straightforward to distinguish the parallel and antiparallel fibril structures using ssNMR. Our results suggest that it is potentially feasible to design structure-selective inhibitors and/or diagnostic agents to Abeta fibrils using ssNMR-based structural models.",

    "abstract": "The dimer of the amyloid-beta peptide Abeta of 42 residues is the smallest toxic species in Alzheimer's disease, but its equilibrium structures are unknown. Here we determined the equilibrium ensembles generated by the four atomistic OPLS-AA, CHARMM22*, AMBER99sb-ildn, and AMBERsb14 force fields with the TIP3P water model. On the basis of 144 mus replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations (with 750 ns per replica), we find that the four force fields lead to random coil ensembles with calculated cross-collision sections, hydrodynamics properties, and small-angle X-ray scattering profiles independent of the force field. There are, however, marked differences in secondary structure, with the AMBERsb14 and CHARMM22* ensembles overestimating the CD-derived helix content, and the OPLS-AA and AMBER99sb-ildn secondary structure contents in agreement with CD data. Also the intramolecular beta-hairpin content spanning residues 17-21 and 30-36 varies between 1.5% and 13%. Overall, there are significant differences in tertiary and quaternary conformations among all force fields, and the key finding, irrespective of the force field, is that the dimer is stabilized by nonspecific interactions, explaining therefore its possible transient binding to multiple cellular partners and, in part, its toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Structural investigations have revealed that beta hairpin structures are common features in amyloid fibrils, suggesting that these motifs play an important role in amyloid assembly. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the effect of the hairpin fold on the aggregation process using a model beta hairpin structure, consisting of two Abeta(14-23) monomers connected by a turn forming YNGK peptide. AFM studies of the assembled aggregates revealed that the hairpin forms spherical structures whereas linear Abeta(14-23) monomers form fibrils. Additionally, an equimolar mixture of the monomer and the hairpin assembles into non-fibrillar aggregates, demonstrating that the hairpin fold dramatically changes the morphology of assembled amyloid aggregates. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying the role of the hairpin fold on amyloid assembly, we performed single-molecule probing experiments to measure interactions between hairpin and monomer and two hairpin complexes. The studies reveal that the stability of hairpin-monomer complexes is much higher than hairpin-hairpin complexes. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed a novel intercalated complex for the hairpin and monomer and Monte Carlo modeling further demonstrated that such nano-assemblies have elevated stability compared with stability of the dimer formed by Abeta(14-23) hairpin. The role of such folding on the amyloid assembly is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic loss is a symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is associated with the onset of cognitive decline and the loss of executive function. The strongest genetic risk factor for AD is the APOE4 allele, which results in both a greater risk of developing AD as well as an earlier age of onset of AD. Dendritic spines, the anatomical substrate of the excitatory synapse, are reduced in the cortex of humanized APOE4 mice but the reason for this synaptic decline is unknown. Calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin dependent phosphatase, is a mediator of dendritic spine retraction. We used humanized APOE mice to examine how APOE genotype altered calcineurin activity and found that APOE4 mice have 35% higher cortical calcineurin activity compared with APOE3 mice. This occurred in the absence of any increase in calcineurin protein levels or mRNA expression. The elevation in calcineurin was associated with 10% fewer dendritic spine number in layer II/III of the cortex. Treatment with the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 reduced calcineurin activity by 64% and resulted in normalization of dendritic spine numbers in APOE4 mice. In conclusion, we found that the APOE4 gene in mice was associated with elevated calcineurin activity and fewer dendritic spine numbers compared with APOE3 mice. Importantly, calcineurin in APOE4 remained sensitive to pharmacological inhibition and spine density can be rescued by treatment with FK506.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's), an ultimately fatal form of dementia, is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 3.6% of all deaths in 2014 (1,2). Alzheimer's deaths can be an indicator of paid and unpaid caregiver burden because nearly everyone in the final stages of Alzheimer's needs constant care, regardless of the setting, as the result of functional and cognitive declines (2). To examine deaths with Alzheimer's as the underlying cause, state-level and county-level death certificate data from the National Vital Statistics System for the period 1999-2014 were analyzed. A total of 93,541 Alzheimer's deaths occurred in the United States in 2014 at an age-adjusted (to the 2000 standard population) rate of 25.4 deaths per 100,000 population, a 54.5% increase compared with the 1999 rate of 16.5 deaths per 100,000. Most deaths occurred in a nursing home or long-term care facility. The percentage of Alzheimer's decedents who died in a medical facility (e.g., hospital) declined from 14.7% in 1999 to 6.6% in 2014, whereas the percentage who died at home increased from 13.9% in 1999 to 24.9% in 2014. Significant increases in Alzheimer's deaths coupled with an increase in the number of persons with Alzheimer's dying at home have likely added to the burden on family members or other unpaid caregivers. Caregivers might benefit from interventions such as education, respite care, and case management that can lessen the potential burden of caregiving and can improve the care received by persons with Alzheimer's.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: There is a need for inexpensive noninvasive tests to identify older healthy persons at risk for Alzheimer disease (AD) for enrollment in AD prevention trials. Our objective was to examine whether abnormalities in neuroimaging measures of amyloid and neurodegeneration are correlated with odor identification (OI) in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. METHODS: Cognitively normal (CN) participants had olfactory function assessed using the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT), underwent magnetic resonance imaging (n = 829) to assess a composite AD signature cortical thickness and hippocampal volume (HVa), and underwent 11 C-Pittsburgh compound B (n = 306) and 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (n = 305) positron emission tomography scanning to assess amyloid accumulation and brain hypometabolism, respectively. The association of neuroimaging biomarkers with OI was examined using multinomial logistic regression and simple linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 829 CN participants (mean age = 79.2 years; 51.5% men), 248 (29.9%) were normosmic and 78 (9.4%) had anosmia (B-SIT score < 6). Abnormal AD signature cortical thickness and reduced HVa were associated with decreased OI as a continuous measure (slope = -0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.76 to -0.09, p = 0.01 and slope = -0.72, 95% CI = -1.15 to -0.28, p < 0.01, respectively). Reduced HVa, decreased AD signature cortical thickness, and increased amyloid accumulation were significantly associated with increased odds of anosmia. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that OI may be a noninvasive, inexpensive marker for risk stratification, for identifying participants at the preclinical stage of AD who may be at risk for cognitive impairment and eligible for inclusion in AD prevention clinical trials. These cross-sectional findings remain to be validated prospectively. Ann Neurol 2017;81:871-882.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide plays an important role in the onset and progress of Alzheimer's disease (AD); hence, targeting Abeta aggregation is considered as an effective therapeutic strategy. Here, we studied the aromatic-interaction-mediated inhibitory effect of oligomeric polypeptides (K8Y8, K4Y8, K8W8) on Abeta42 fibrillization process. The polypeptides containing lysine as well as representative aromatic amino acids of tryptophan or tyrosine were found to greatly suppress the aggregation as evaluated by thioflavin T assay. Circular dichroism spectra showed that the beta-sheet formation of Abeta42 peptides decreased with the polypeptide additives. Molecular docking studies revealed that the oligomeric polypeptides could preferentially bind to Abeta42 through pi-pi stacking between aromatic amino acids and Phe19, together with hydrogen bonding. The cell viability assay confirmed that the toxicity of Abeta42 to SH-SY5Y cells was markedly reduced in the presence of polypeptides.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) mutations are the most common cause of familial early onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). The PSEN1 E280A (E280A) mutation has an autosomal dominant inheritance and is involved in the production of amyloid-beta. The largest family group of carriers with E280A mutation is found in Antioquia, Colombia. The study of mutation carriers provides a unique opportunity to identify brain changes in stages previous to AD. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a low cost and minimally invasiveness technique that enables the following of brain changes in AD. OBJECTIVE: To examine how previous reported differences in EEG for Theta and Alpha-2 rhythms in E280A subjects are related to specific regions in cortex and could be tracked across different ages. METHODS: EEG signals were acquired during resting state from non-carriers and carriers, asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects from E280A kindred from Antioquia, Colombia. Independent component analysis (ICA) and inverse solution methods were used to locate brain regions related to differences in Theta and Alpha-2 bands. RESULTS: ICA identified two components, mainly related to the Precuneus, where the differences in Theta and Alpha-2 exist simultaneously at asymptomatic and symptomatic stages. When the ratio between Theta and Alpha-2 is used, significant correlations exist with age and a composite cognitive scale. CONCLUSION: Theta and Alpha-2 rhythms are altered in E280A subjects. The alterations are possible to track at Precuneus regions using EEG, ICA, and inverse solution methods.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The association between the apolipoprotein E (APOE) e4 allele and high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia before the age of 80 has been recognized for over 30 years. However, the timing and mode of action of APOE is not understood, nor has there been a detailed analysis of the effect of APOE genotype on memory, hippocampal volume, and amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels in cognitively normal adults. OBJECTIVE: Examine the effect of APOE allelic genotype on the relationship between Abeta levels, hippocampal volume, and memory in cognitively normal adults. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of 989 cognitively normal older adults enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study, all of whom underwent APOE genotyping and memory assessment. A subset of this group underwent PET neuroimaging for Abeta (n = 585) and MRI for hippocampal volume (n = 303). RESULTS: APOEe4 homozygotes (e4/e4) showed significantly worse episodic memory and higher Abeta levels than e4 heterozygotes. The relationship between increasing Abeta levels and worse episodic memory was significant for e3 homozygotes (e3/e3), e4 heterozygotes, and strongest for e4 homozygotes. There were no differences in hippocampal volume between APOE groups; the relationship between smaller hippocampal volume and worse episodic memory was significant only for e4 homozygotes. CONCLUSION: APOE acts in a co-dominant fashion on Abeta levels, episodic memory, and hippocampal volume in cognitively normal older adults. APOEe4 is central to the events that lead to AD in cognitively normal older adults, likely through a quantitative role in the disruption of Abeta clearance.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is an irreversible and progressive brain disorder featured by the accumulation of Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, which forms insoluble assemblies that builds up into plaques resulting in cognitive decline and memory loss. The formation of fibrillar amyloid deposits is accompanied by conformational changes of the soluble Abeta peptide into beta-sheet structures. Strategies to prevent or reduce Abeta aggregation using small molecules such as trehalose have shown beneficial effects under in vitro cell- and in vivo mouse- models. However, the role of trehalose in reducing Abeta peptide aggregation is still not clear. In the present study, using circular dichroism- and fluorescence emission- spectroscopies, we demonstrated that in the presence of trehalose, Abeta peptide adopts more helical content and undergoes a disorder/order conformational transition. Based on our findings, we conclude that trehalose affects the conformation of Abeta peptide to form alpha-helical structure, which may inhibit the formation of beta-sheets and thereby aggregation.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, affecting approximately 33.5 million people worldwide. Aging is the main risk factor associated with AD. Drug discovery based on nutraceutical molecules for prevention and treatment of AD is a growing topic. In this sense, carotenoids are phytochemicals present mainly in fruits and vegetables with reported benefits for human health. In this research, the anti-amyloidogenic activity of three carotenoids, cryptocapsin, cryptocapsin-5,6-epoxide, and zeaxanthin, was assessed. Cryptocapsin showed the highest bioactivity, while cryptocapsin-5,6-epoxide and zeaxanthin exhibited similar activity on anti-aggregation assays. Molecular modeling analysis revealed that the evaluated carotenoids might follow two mechanisms for inhibiting Abeta aggregation: by preventing the formation of the fibril and through disruption of the Abeta aggregates. Our studies provided evidence that cryptocapsin, cryptocapsin-5,6-epoxide, and zeaxanthin have anti-amyloidogenic potential and could be used for prevention and treatment of AD.",

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of galantamine on proliferation, senescence and ROS production in a U87 cell line treated with Abeta. With the use of a Cell Counting Kit-8 and beta galactosidase staining assay, we observed that galantamine (0.3muM) pretreatment significantly prevented Abeta1-40-induced cell degradation and senescence. Abeta1-40-induced ROS production and p53 expression were increased as determined by DCF-derived fluorescence using flow cytometry and Western blotting and reduced in response to galantamine pretreatment. Overall, we found that all alterations resulting from Abeta1-40 were reversed by galantamine pretreatment. In addition, we demonstrate that this neuroprotection from galantamine can be blocked by an alpha7 nAChR antagonist. Taken together, the findings of this study provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of galantamine, effects which include antioxidative properties.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is associated with the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides into oligomers and fibrils. We have explored how model lipid membranes modulate the rate and mechanisms of Abeta(1-42) self-assembly, in order to shed light on how this pathological reaction may occur in the lipid-rich environments that the peptide encounters in the brain. Using a combination of in vitro biophysical experiments and theoretical approaches, we show that zwitterionic DOPC lipid vesicles accelerate the Abeta(1-42) fibril growth rate by interacting specifically with the growing fibrils. We probe this interaction with help of a purpose-developed Forster resonance energy transfer assay that monitors the proximity between a fibril-specific dye and fluorescent lipids in the lipid vesicle membrane. To further rationalise these findings we use mathematical models to fit the aggregation kinetics of Abeta(1-42) and find that lipid vesicles alter specific mechanistic steps in the aggregation reaction; they augment monomer-dependent secondary nucleation at the surface of existing fibrils and facilitate monomer-independent catalytic processes consistent with fibril fragmentation. We further show that DOPC vesicles have no effect on primary nucleation. This finding is consistent with experiments showing that Abeta(1-42) monomers do not directly bind to the lipid bilayer. Taken together, our results show that plain lipid membranes with charge and composition that is representative of outer cell membranes can significantly augment autocatalytic steps in the self-assembly of Abeta(1-42) into fibrils. This new insight suggests that strategies to reduce fibril-lipid interactions in the brain may have therapeutic value.",

    "title": "Complement C3 deficiency protects against neurodegeneration in aged plaque-rich APP/PS1 mice.",
    "abstract": "The complement cascade not only is an innate immune response that enables removal of pathogens but also plays an important role in microglia-mediated synaptic refinement during brain development. Complement C3 is elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), colocalizing with neuritic plaques, and appears to contribute to clearance of Abeta by microglia in the brain. Previously, we reported that C3-deficient C57BL/6 mice were protected against age-related and region-specific loss of hippocampal synapses and cognitive decline during normal aging. Furthermore, blocking complement and downstream iC3b/CR3 signaling rescued synapses from Abeta-induced loss in young AD mice before amyloid plaques had accumulated. We assessed the effects of C3 deficiency in aged, plaque-rich APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice (APP/PS1;C3 KO). We examined the effects of C3 deficiency on cognition, Abeta plaque deposition, and plaque-related neuropathology at later AD stages in these mice. We found that 16-month-old APP/PS1;C3 KO mice performed better on a learning and memory task than did APP/PS1 mice, despite having more cerebral Abeta plaques. Aged APP/PS1;C3 KO mice also had fewer microglia and astrocytes localized within the center of hippocampal Abeta plaques compared to APP/PS1 mice. Several proinflammatory cytokines in the brain were reduced in APP/PS1;C3 KO mice, consistent with an altered microglial phenotype. C3 deficiency also protected APP/PS1 mice against age-dependent loss of synapses and neurons. Our study suggests that complement C3 or downstream complement activation fragments may play an important role in Abeta plaque pathology, glial responses to plaques, and neuronal dysfunction in the brains of APP/PS1 mice.",

    "title": "Zinc-binding structure of a catalytic amyloid from solid-state NMR.",
    "abstract": "Throughout biology, amyloids are key structures in both functional proteins and the end product of pathologic protein misfolding. Amyloids might also represent an early precursor in the evolution of life because of their small molecular size and their ability to self-purify and catalyze chemical reactions. They also provide attractive backbones for advanced materials. When beta-strands of an amyloid are arranged parallel and in register, side chains from the same position of each chain align, facilitating metal chelation when the residues are good ligands such as histidine. High-resolution structures of metalloamyloids are needed to understand the molecular bases of metal-amyloid interactions. Here we combine solid-state NMR and structural bioinformatics to determine the structure of a zinc-bound metalloamyloid that catalyzes ester hydrolysis. The peptide forms amphiphilic parallel beta-sheets that assemble into stacked bilayers with alternating hydrophobic and polar interfaces. The hydrophobic interface is stabilized by apolar side chains from adjacent sheets, whereas the hydrated polar interface houses the Zn2+-binding histidines with binding geometries unusual in proteins. Each Zn2+ has two bis-coordinated histidine ligands, which bridge adjacent strands to form an infinite metal-ligand chain along the fibril axis. A third histidine completes the protein ligand environment, leaving a free site on the Zn2+ for water activation. This structure defines a class of materials, which we call metal-peptide frameworks. The structure reveals a delicate interplay through which metal ions stabilize the amyloid structure, which in turn shapes the ligand geometry and catalytic reactivity of Zn2.",

    "abstract": "Impaired brain clearance of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) 40 and 42 across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is believed to be one of the pathways responsible for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Hyperinsulinemia prevalent in type II diabetes was shown to damage cerebral vasculature and increase Abeta accumulation in AD brain. However, there is no clarity on how aberrations in peripheral insulin levels affect Abeta accumulation in the brain. This study describes, for the first time, an intricate relation between plasma insulin and Abeta transport at the BBB. Upon peripheral insulin administration in wild-type mice: the plasma clearance of Abeta40 increased, but Abeta42 clearance reduced; the plasma-to-brain influx of Abeta40 increased, and that of Abeta42 reduced; and the clearance of intracerebrally injected Abeta40 decreased, whereas Abeta42 clearance increased. In hCMEC/D3 monolayers (in vitro BBB model) exposed to insulin, the luminal uptake and luminal-to-abluminal permeability of Abeta40 increased and that of Abeta42 reduced; the abluminal-to-luminal permeability of Abeta40 decreased, whereas Abeta42 permeability increased. Moreover, Abeta cellular trafficking machinery was altered. In summary, Abeta40 and Abeta42 demonstrated distinct distribution kinetics in plasma and brain compartments, and insulin differentially modulated their distribution. Cerebrovascular disease and metabolic disorders may disrupt this intricate homeostasis and aggravate AD pathology.",

Using NMR spectroscopy, EXAFS spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and isothermal titration calorimetry the interaction of zinc ions with Abeta fragments 1-7 and 1-10 carrying familial Taiwanese mutation D7H was studied. Zinc ions induce formation of a stable homodimer formed by the two peptide chains fastened by two zinc ions and stacking interactions of imidazole rings.

    "abstract": "See Markus (doi:10.1093/awx161) for a scientific commentary on this article.Evidence for vascular contributions to Alzheimer's disease has been increasingly identified, with increased blood pressure and decreased cerebral blood flow both linked to in vivo biomarkers and clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease. We therefore hypothesized that an elevated ratio of blood pressure to cerebral blood flow, indicative of cerebrovascular resistance, would exhibit earlier and more widespread associations with Alzheimer's disease than cerebral blood flow alone. Further, we predicted that increased cerebrovascular resistance and amyloid retention would synergistically influence cognitive performance trajectories, independent of neuronal metabolism. Lastly, we anticipated associations between cerebrovascular resistance and later brain atrophy, prior to amyloid accumulation. To evaluate these hypotheses, we investigated associations between cerebrovascular resistance and amyloid retention, cognitive decline, and brain atrophy, controlling for neuronal metabolism. North American older adults (n = 232) underwent arterial spin labelling magnetic resonance imaging to measure regional cerebral blood flow in brain regions susceptible to ageing and Alzheimer's disease. An estimated cerebrovascular resistance index was then calculated as the ratio of mean arterial pressure to regional cerebral blood flow. Positron emission tomography with 18F-florbetapir and fludeoxyglucose was used to quantify amyloid retention and neuronal metabolism, respectively. Cognitive performance was evaluated via annual assessments of global cognition, memory, and executive function. Results indicated diminished inferior parietal and temporal cerebral blood flow for patients with Alzheimer's disease (n = 33) relative to both non-demented groups, but no cerebral blood flow differences between non-demented amyloid-positive (n = 87) and amyloid-negative (n = 112) cases. In contrast, the cerebrovascular resistance index was significantly elevated in amyloid-positive versus amyloid-negative cases, with additional elevation in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, cerebrovascular resistance index group differences were of greater statistical effect size and encompassed a greater number of brain regions than those for cerebral blood flow alone. Cognitive decline over 2-year follow-up was accelerated by elevated baseline cerebrovascular resistance index, particularly for amyloid-positive individuals. Increased baseline cerebrovascular resistance index also predicted greater progression to dementia, beyond that attributable to amyloid-positivity. Finally, increased cerebrovascular resistance index predicted greater regional atrophy among non-demented older adults who were amyloid-negative. Findings suggest that increased cerebrovascular resistance may represent a previously unrecognized contributor to Alzheimer's disease that is independent of neuronal hypometabolism, predates changes in brain perfusion, exacerbates and works synergistically with amyloidosis to produce cognitive decline, and drives amyloid-independent brain atrophy during the earliest stage of disease.",

Amyloid-positivity was defined as 11C-Pittsburgh compound B target-to-cerebellar ratio above 1.5 within a composite cortical volume of interest. Supervised cluster analysis was used to generate parametric maps of 11C-(R)-PK11195 binding potential. Levels of 11C-(R)-PK11195 binding potential were measured in a selection of cortical volumes of interest and at a voxel level. Twenty-six (62%) of 42 mild cognitive impairment cases showed a raised cortical amyloid load compared to healthy controls. Twenty-two (85%) of the 26 amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment cases showed clusters of increased cortical microglial activation accompanying the amyloid. There was a positive correlation between levels of amyloid load and 11C-(R)-PK11195 binding potentials at a voxel level within subregions of frontal, parietal and temporal cortices. 11C-(R)-PK11195 positron emission tomography reveals increased inflammation in a majority of amyloid positive mild cognitive impairment cases, its cortical distribution overlapping that of amyloid deposition.",

Here, I will discuss the monomer from a functional evolutionary perspective, highlighting the potential advantages of a native unfolded state that, however, involves an amyloidogenic risk.

    "abstract": "In rodents, fragmented and low levels of maternal care have been implicated in age-related cognitive decline and the incidence and progression of Alzheimer's pathology. In contrast, enhancing early postnatal maternal care has been associated with improved cognitive function later in life. Here we examined whether early postnatal handling of mouse pups from postnatal days 2-9 enhanced maternal care and whether this affected cognition and Alzheimer pathology at 5 and 11months of age in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model for Alzheimer's disease. Brief, 15min daily episodes of separating offspring from their dams from postnatal days 2-9 (early handling, EH) increased maternal care of the dam towards her pups upon reunion. At 11 (but not 5) months of age, EH APPswe/PS1dE1 mice displayed significantly reduced amyloid plaque pathology in the hippocampus. At this age, EH also prevented short-term working memory deficits while restoring impairments in contextual fear memory formation in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. EH did not modulate amyloid pathology in the amygdala, nor did it affect auditory fear conditioning deficits in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. We conclude that increased levels of maternal care during the early life period delays amyloid accumulation and cognitive decline in an Alzheimer's mouse model, involving the hippocampus, but not to the amygdala. These studies highlight the importance of the early postnatal period in modulating resilience to develop Alzheimer's pathology later in life.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) into amyloid fibrils is a defining characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Because of the complexity of this aggregation process, effective therapeutic inhibitors will need to target the specific microscopic steps that lead to the production of neurotoxic species. We introduce a strategy for generating fibril-specific antibodies that selectively suppress fibril-dependent secondary nucleation of the 42-residue form of Abeta (Abeta42). We target this step because it has been shown to produce the majority of neurotoxic species during aggregation of Abeta42. Starting from large phage display libraries of single-chain antibody fragments (scFvs), the three-stage approach that we describe includes (i) selection of scFvs with high affinity for Abeta42 fibrils after removal of scFvs that bind Abeta42 in its monomeric form; (ii) ranking, by surface plasmon resonance affinity measurements, of the resulting candidate scFvs that bind to the Abeta42 fibrils; and (iii) kinetic screening and analysis to find the scFvs that inhibit selectively the fibril-catalyzed secondary nucleation process in Abeta42 aggregation. By applying this approach, we have identified four scFvs that inhibit specifically the fibril-dependent secondary nucleation process. Our method also makes it possible to discard antibodies that inhibit elongation, an important factor because the suppression of elongation does not target directly the production of toxic oligomers and may even lead to its increase. On the basis of our results, we suggest that the method described here could form the basis for rationally designed immunotherapy strategies to combat Alzheimer's and related neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pyroglutamylation of truncated Abeta peptides, which is catalysed by enzyme glutaminyl cyclase (QC), generates pE-Abeta species with enhanced aggregation propensities and resistance to most amino-peptidases and endo-peptidases. pE-Abeta species have been identified as major constituents of Abeta plaques and reduction of pE-Abeta species is associated with improvement of cognitive tasks in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pharmacological inhibition of QC has thus emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for AD. Here, we question whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) QC enzymatic activity differs between AD patients and controls and whether inflammatory or angiogenesis mediators, some of which are potential QC substrates, and/or Abeta peptides may serve as pharmacodynamic read-outs for QC inhibition. METHODS: QC activity, Abeta peptides and inflammatory or angiogenesis mediators were measured in CSF of a clinically well-characterized cohort of 20 mild AD patients, 20 moderate AD patients and 20 subjective memory complaints (SMC) controls. Correlation of these parameters with core diagnostic CSF AD biomarkers (Abeta42, tau and p-tau) and clinical features was evaluated. RESULTS: QC activity shows a tendency to decrease with AD progression (p = 0.129). The addition of QC activity to biomarkers tau and p-tau significantly increases diagnostic power (ROC-AUCTAU = 0.878, ROC-AUCTAU&QC = 0.939 and ROC-AUCpTAU = 0.820, ROC-AUCpTAU&QC = 0.948). In AD and controls, QC activity correlates with Abeta38 (r = 0.83, p < 0.0001) and Abeta40 (r = 0.84, p < 0.0001), angiogenesis mediators (Flt1, Tie2, VEGFD, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, r > 0.5, p < 0.0001) and core diagnostic biomarkers (r > 0.35, p = <0.0057). QC activity does not correlate with MMSE or ApoE genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Abeta38, Abeta40 and angiogenesis mediators (Flt1, Tie2, VEGFD, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1) are potential pharmacodynamic markers of QC inhibition, because their levels closely correlate with QC activity in AD patients. The addition of QC activity to core diagnostic CSF biomarkers may be of specific interest in clinical cases with discordant imaging and biochemical biomarker results.",

    "title": "Recommendations for cerebrospinal fluid collection for the analysis by ELISA of neurogranin trunc P75, alpha-synuclein, and total tau in combination with Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40).",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of neurodegeneration is complex. Its diagnosis requires an early identification of sequential changes in several hallmarks in the brains of affected subjects. The presence of brain pathology can be visualized in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by protein profiling. It is clear that the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) will benefit from an integration of algorithms including CSF concentrations of individual proteins, especially as an aid in clinical decision-making or to improve patient enrolment in clinical trials. The protein profiling approach requires standard operating procedures for collection and storage of CSF which must be easy to integrate into a routine clinical lab environment. Our study provides recommendations for analysis of neurogranin trunc P75, alpha-synuclein, and tau, in combination with the ratio of beta-amyloid Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40). METHODS: Protocols for CSF collection were compared with CSF derived from subjects with normal pressure hydrocephalus (n = 19). Variables included recipient type (collection, storage), tube volume, and addition of detergents at the time of collection. CSF biomarker analysis was performed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Data were analyzed with linear repeated measures and mixed effects models. RESULTS: Adsorption to recipients is lower for neurogranin trunc P75, alpha-synuclein, and tau (<10%), as compared to Abeta(1-42). For neurogranin trunc P75 and total tau, there is still an effect on analyte concentrations as a function of the tube volume. Protocol-related differences for Abeta(1-42) can be normalized at the (pre-)analytical level using the ratio Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40), but not by using the ratio Abeta(1-42)/tau. The addition of detergent at the time of collection eliminates differences due to adsorption. CONCLUSIONS: Our study recommends the use of low protein binding tubes for quantification in CSF (without additives) of all relevant CSF biomarkers. Pre-analytical factors have less effect on alpha-synuclein, neurogranin trunc P75, and total tau, as compared to Abeta(1-42). The ratio of Abeta(1-42)/Abeta(1-40), but not Abeta(1-42)/tau, can be used to adjust for pre-analytical differences in analyte concentrations. Our study does not recommend the inclusion of detergents at the time of collection of CSF. The present results provide an experimental basis for new recommendations for parallel analysis of several proteins using one protocol for collection and storage of CSF.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics alterations are two major hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. Dysfunctional mitochondria accumulate in Alzheimer's disease-affected brains by yet unexplained mechanisms. METHODS: We combined cell biology, molecular biology, and pharmacological approaches to unravel a novel molecular pathway by which presenilins control phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced kinase 1 (Pink-1) expression and transcription. In vivo approaches were carried out on various transgenic and knockout animals as well as in adeno-associated virus-infected mice. Functional readout and mitochondrial physiology (mitochondrial potential) were assessed by combined procedures including flow cytometry, live imaging analysis, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We show that presenilins 1 and 2 trigger opposite effects on promoter transactivation, messenger RNA, and protein expression of Pink-1. This control is linked to gamma-secretase activity and beta-amyloid precursor protein but is independent of phosphatase and tensin homolog. We show that amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD) accounts for presenilin-dependent phenotype and upregulates Pink-1 transactivation in cells as well as in vivo in a Forkhead box O3a-dependent manner. Interestingly, the modulation of gamma-secretase activity or AICD expression affects Pink-1-related control of mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics. Finally, we show that parkin acts upstream of presenilins to control Pink-1 promoter transactivation and protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we delineate a molecular cascade presenilins-AICD-Forkhead box O3a linking parkin to Pink-1. Our study demonstrates AICD-mediated Pink-1-dependent control of mitochondrial physiology by presenilins. Furthermore, it unravels a parkin-Pink-1 feedback loop controlling mitochondrial physiology that could be disrupted in neurodegenerative conditions.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease with tens of millions of people affected worldwide. The pathogenesis is still poorly understood and various therapeutical approaches targeting the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, a product of the amyloidogenic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), failed. Moreover, a couple of studies critically questioned the relevance of Abeta in the pathogenesis of AD. Thus, new ideas need to be studied and one highly interesting hypothesis is the APP mediated signal transduction to the nucleus. As a consequence nuclear -potentially toxic- structures emerge, which were recently found to a high extent in human AD tissue and thus, may contribute to neurodegeneration. Relevant for the signaling machinery are modifications at the very C-terminal end of the precursor protein, the APP intracellular domain (AICD). In this review we update the knowledge on mechanisms on AICD referring to our 2008 article: The amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD) as modulator of gene expression, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal dynamics-Relevance for Alzheimer's disease (T. Muller, et al., 2008). We summarize how AICD is generated and degraded, we describe its intramolecular motifs, translational modifications, and how those as well as APP dimerization influence AICD generation and function. Moreover, we resume the AICD interactome and elucidate AICDs involvement in nuclear signaling, transcriptional regulation, cell death, DNA repair and cell cycle re-entry and we give insights in its physiological function. Results are summarized in the comprehensive poster \"The world of AICD\".",

    "abstract": "In this work we study the effect of solution ionic strength on the structural evolution of amidated amyloid beta peptide Abeta (1-40) oligomers at the early stages of fibril formation. By light scattering, we follow the time evolution of the structure and short-time dynamics of peptide structures at low ionic strengths. Our results allow identifying initial oligomer structures as the effective building blocks in the amyloid fibrils formation and indicate that the oligomers growth pathway, from compact structures to flexible chain-like structures, becomes faster as the solution ionic strength is increased. Furthermore, we find no evidence of structural branching what suggests that elongation of amyloid fibrils is dominated by linear association. To describe our results we adapt a phenomenological model based on population balance equations and linear polymer growth, where the parameters required are obtained from the experiments. Model calculations are in good agreement with experimentally-obtained estimates for the radius of gyration of Abeta (1-40) oligomers, thus further supporting our findings. Additionally, we introduce a model for the effective interaction among initial Abeta structures that captures the dependence of the effective association rates on solution ionic strength.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, Abeta 1-42 (Abeta42) and Abeta43, in particular, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Rebamipide (REB), a gastrointestinal protective drug, can cross the blood-brain barrier after oral administration; however, the effects of REB on neuronal cells have not yet been reported. In this study, we investigated the effects of REB on Abeta43-induced cytotoxicity (monomers, 10muM) in cultured SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Addition of REB (10-1000nM) into the media partially ameliorated the reduced cell viability observed after Abeta43 treatment, which was determined by the MTT assay. REB reduced the levels of intracellular Abeta oligomers (100-150kDa) that were formed from the exogenous addition of Abeta43 monomers. In addition, REB (30nM) reduced endogenous Abeta42 secretion, which was analyzed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, REB enhanced the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme/a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17, neprilysin, matrix-metalloproteinase-14 (MMP-14)/membrane type-1 MMP, cyclooxygenase-2, and sirtuin 1, even in cells challenged with Abeta43. These results suggest that REB improves the cell viability by inducing genes that regulate Abeta levels and also genes that are cytoprotective. The secondary use of REB may have potential in the prevention of Abeta-mediated diseases, particularly AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by intracerebral deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta). While Abeta40 is the most abundant form, neurotoxicity is mainly mediated by Abeta42. Sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases gives rise to full-length Abeta (Abeta1-x) and N-terminally truncated Abeta' (Abeta11-x) whereas cleavage by alpha- and gamma-secretases leads to the shorter p3 peptides (Abeta17-x). We uncovered significantly higher ratios of 42- versus 40-ending variants for Abeta and Abeta' than for p3 secreted by mouse neurons and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons or produced in a cell-free gamma-secretase assay with recombinant APP-CTFs. The 42:40 ratio was highest for Abeta', followed by Abeta and then p3. Mass spectrometry analysis of APP intracellular domains revealed differential processing of APP-C83, APP-C89, and APP-C99 by gamma-secretase already at the epsilon-cleavage stage. This mechanistic insight could aid in developing substrate-targeted modulators of APP-C99 processing to specifically lower the Abeta42:Abeta40 ratio without compromising gamma-secretase function.",

X-ray crystallography reveals that the macrocyclic beta-sheet assembles to form double-walled nanotubes, with an inner diameter of 7 nm and outer diameter of 11 nm. The inner wall is composed of an extended network of hydrogen-bonded dimers. The outer wall is composed of a separate extended network of beta-barrel-like tetramers. These large peptide nanotubes pack into a hexagonal lattice that resembles a honeycomb. The complexity and size of the peptide nanotubes rivals some of the largest tubular biomolecular assemblies, such as GroEL and microtubules. These observations demonstrate that small amyloidogenic sequences can be used to build large nanostructures.",

    "title": "Association Between Periodontitis and Amyloid beta Peptide in Elderly People With and Without Cognitive Impairment.",

The aim of this study is to determine whether periodontitis is related to the amyloid beta (Abeta) load in blood and the role of any such relationship in the association between Abeta and cognitive impairment. METHODS: A case-control study was performed in elderly people diagnosed with cognitive impairment with or without dementia (cases group) and cognitively healthy elderly people (control group); data were collected on the medical and dental history of participants, and blood samples were drawn to determine Abeta levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The study included 166 patients and 122 control participants. Higher blood Abeta1-42 levels (P = 0.01) and higher Abeta42:40 ratio (P = 0.06) were observed in participants with severe attachment loss than in other participants. Periodontitis was a significant interaction variable, given that the association between Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 and cognitive impairment was only observed in patients with severe periodontitis. According to these data, periodontitis may be a modulating variable of the association between Abeta and cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma Abeta1-42 levels are higher in individuals who have severe periodontal disease. The presence of periodontitis may modify the association between Abeta and cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "The present study was performed to investigate the protective effect of phytoceramide against ss-amyloid protein (Abeta) (25-35)-induced memory impairment and its underlying mechanisms in mice. Memory impairment in mice was induced by intracerebroventricular injection of 15 nmol Abeta (25-35) and measured by the passive avoidance test and Morris water maze test. Chronic administration of phytoceramide (10, 25 and 50 mg/kg, p.o.) resulted in significantly less Abeta (25-35)-induced memory loss and hippocampal neuronal death in treated mice compared to controls. The decrease of glutathione level and increase of lipid peroxidation in brain tissue following injection of Abeta (25-35) was reduced by phytoceramide. Alteration of apoptosis-related proteins, increase of inflammatory factors, and phosphorylation of mitogen activated proteins kinases (MAPKs) in Abeta (25-35)-administered mice hippocampus were inhibited by phytoceramide. Phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were suppressed, while phosphorylation of tau (p-tau) was increased in Ass (25-35)-treated mice brain; these effects were significantly inhibited by administration of phytoceramide. These results suggest that phytoceramide has a possible therapeutic role in managing cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer's disease. The underlying mechanism might involve inhibition of p-tau formation via anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammation activity and promotion of PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling process.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a detrimental neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatments. Due to cellular heterogeneity, defining the roles of immune cell subsets in AD onset and progression has been challenging. Using transcriptional single-cell sorting, we comprehensively map all immune populations in wild-type and AD-transgenic (Tg-AD) mouse brains. We describe a novel microglia type associated with neurodegenerative diseases (DAM) and identify markers, spatial localization, and pathways associated with these cells. Immunohistochemical staining of mice and human brain slices shows DAM with intracellular/phagocytic Abeta particles. Single-cell analysis of DAM in Tg-AD and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2)-/- Tg-AD reveals that the DAM program is activated in a two-step process. Activation is initiated in a Trem2-independent manner that involves downregulation of microglia checkpoints, followed by activation of a Trem2-dependent program. This unique microglia-type has the potential to restrict neurodegeneration, which may have important implications for future treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. VIDEO ABSTRACT.",

    "abstract": "Self-assembly of peptides is closely related to many diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and prion diseases. Understanding the basic mechanism of this assembly is essential for designing ultimate cure and preventive measures. Template-assisted self-assembly (TASA) of peptides on inorganic substrates can provide fundamental understanding of substrate-dependent peptides assemble, including the role of hydrophobic interface on the peptide fibrillization. Here, we have studied the self-assembly process of a potential pentapeptide inhibitor on the surface of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) using real time atomic force microscopy (RT-AFM) as well as molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Experimental and simulation results show nanofilament formation consisting of beta-sheet structures and epitaxial growth on HOPG. Height analysis of the nanofilaments and MD simulation indicate that the peptides adopt a lying down configuration of double-layered antiparallel beta-sheets for its epitaxial growth, and the number of nanofilament layers is concentration-dependent. These findings provide new perspective for the mechanism of peptide-based fibrillization in amyloid diseases as well as for designing well-ordered micrometrical and nanometrical structures.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, increasingly attributed to neuronal dysfunction induced by amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaOs). Although the impact of AbetaOs on neurons has been extensively studied, only recently have the possible effects of AbetaOs on astrocytes begun to be investigated. Given the key roles of astrocytes in synapse formation, plasticity, and function, we sought to investigate the impact of AbetaOs on astrocytes, and to determine whether this impact is related to the deleterious actions of AbetaOs on synapses. We found that AbetaOs interact with astrocytes, cause astrocyte activation and trigger abnormal generation of reactive oxygen species, which is accompanied by impairment of astrocyte neuroprotective potential in vitro We further show that both murine and human astrocyte conditioned media (CM) increase synapse density, reduce AbetaOs binding, and prevent AbetaO-induced synapse loss in cultured hippocampal neurons. Both a neutralizing anti-transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) antibody and siRNA-mediated knockdown of TGF-beta1, previously identified as an important synaptogenic factor secreted by astrocytes, abrogated the protective action of astrocyte CM against AbetaO-induced synapse loss. Notably, TGF-beta1 prevented hippocampal dendritic spine loss and memory impairment in mice that received an intracerebroventricular infusion of AbetaOs. Results suggest that astrocyte-derived TGF-beta1 is part of an endogenous mechanism that protects synapses against AbetaOs. By demonstrating that AbetaOs decrease astrocyte ability to protect synapses, our results unravel a new mechanism underlying the synaptotoxic action of AbetaOs in AD.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, mainly attributed to synaptotoxicity of the amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaOs). Here, we investigated the impact of AbetaOs in astrocytes, a less known subject. We show that astrocytes prevent synapse loss induced by AbetaOs, via production of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). We found that AbetaOs trigger morphological and functional alterations in astrocytes, and impair their neuroprotective potential. Notably, TGF-beta1 reduced hippocampal dendritic spine loss and memory impairment in mice that received intracerebroventricular infusions of AbetaOs. Our results describe a new mechanism underlying the toxicity of AbetaOs and indicate novel therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease, mainly focused on TGF-beta1 and astrocytes.",

    "title": "Amyloid beta peptides overexpression in retinal pigment epithelial cells via AAV-mediated gene transfer mimics AMD-like pathology in mice.",
    "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive retinal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular deposits known as drusen. A major constituent of drusen deposits are Alzheimer disease-associated amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides. To understand the etiology of Abeta proteostasis in AMD, we delivered recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding Abeta42 and Abeta40 peptides fused to BRI2 protein by intraocular injection in C57BL/6J mice. Endogenous protease cleavage of such constructs leads to production of secreted Abeta42 and Abeta40 respectively. We demonstrate that overexpression of secreted Abeta40 or Abeta42 resulted in dramatic induction of drusen-like deposits by 2 months' post-injection. These drusen-like deposits were immunopositive for Abeta and complement proteins but did not stain for conventional amyloid dyes, such as Thioflavin S. Both injected cohorts showed gliosis and degenerative changes, though ERG responses were minimally affected. Intriguingly, simultaneous overexpression of BRI-Abeta40 or BRI-Abeta42 together resulted in dose-dependent and cumulative changes reminiscent of AMD type pathology - drusen-like deposits, severe reduction in ERG responses, photoreceptor cell loss and gliosis. Here, we have established a physiological model of Abeta containing deposits in wild-type mice that recapitulates major retinal pathophysiological features of AMD and will be instrumental in mechanistic understanding and development of therapeutic strategies against AMD.",

Although Abeta1-42 formed fibrils on SUVs at all POPC concentrations used, the lag time, elongation rate, maximum thioflavin T intensity, and fibrillar morphology were distinct, indicating polymorphic amyloid formation. LUVs, at low POPC concentrations, did not markedly affect fibrillation kinetics; however, increases in POPC concentrations suppressed amyloid formation. No significant differences in the thermal stabilities of Abeta1-42 fibrils formed with and without vesicles were observed, although fibrils formed on SUVs showed some differences with dilution. SUVs markedly promoted Abeta1-40 fibrillation by condensing Abeta1-40, whereas no effects of LUVs on amyloidogenesis were detected. Salts greatly increased Abeta1-40 amyloidogenicity on vesicles. We proposed comprehensive models for vesicle size-dependent Abeta amyloidogenesis. Inhomogeneous packing defects in SUVs may induce distinct nucleation in the polymorphisms of amyloids and decreasing local concentrations of Abeta with higher amounts of LUVs inhibits amyloid formation. We also pointed out that C-terminal hydrophobicity of Abeta is important for amyloidogenesis on membranes.",

Design, Setting, and Participants: Exploratory analyses were conducted with longitudinal cognitive and biomarker data from 445 cognitively normal individuals in the United States and Canada. Participants were observed from August 23, 2005, to June 7, 2016, for a median of 3.1 years (interquartile range, 2.0-4.2 years; maximum follow-up, 10.3 years) as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).

Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes included scores on the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC; a sum of 4 baseline standardized z scores, which decreases with worse performance), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; 0 [worst] to 30 [best] points), Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-Sum of Boxes; 0 [best] to 18 [worst] points), and Logical Memory Delayed Recall (0 [worst] to 25 [best] story units). Results: Among the 445 participants (243 with normal amyloid, 202 with elevated amyloid), mean (SD) age was 74.0 (5.9) years, mean education was 16.4 (2.7) years, and 52% were women. The mean score for PACC at baseline was 0.00 (2.60); for MMSE, 29.0 (1.2); for CDR-Sum of Boxes, 0.04 (0.14); and for Logical Memory Delayed Recall, 13.1 (3.3). Compared with the group with normal amyloid, those with elevated amyloid had worse mean scores at 4 years on the PACC (mean difference, 1.51 points [95% CI, 0.94-2.10]; P < .001), MMSE (mean difference, 0.56 points [95% CI, 0.32-0.80]; P < .001), and CDR-Sum of Boxes (mean difference, 0.23 points [95% CI, 0.08-0.38]; P = .002). For Logical Memory Delayed Recall, between-group score was not statistically significant at 4 years (mean difference, 0.73 story units [95% CI, -0.02 to 1.48]; P = .056). Conclusions and Relevance: Exploratory analyses of a cognitively normal cohort followed up for a median of 3.1 years suggest that elevation in baseline brain amyloid level, compared with normal brain amyloid level, was associated with higher likelihood of cognitive decline, although the findings are of uncertain clinical significance. Further research is needed to assess the clinical importance of these differences and measure longer-term associations.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid precursor protein (APP), primarily known as the precursor of amyloid peptides that accumulate in the brain of patients with Alzheimer disease, is abundant in platelets, but its physiological function remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of APP in hemostasis and thrombosis, using APP knockout (KO) mice. Ex vivo aggregation, secretion, and integrin alphaIIbbeta3 inside-out activation induced by several agonists were normal in APP-deficient platelets, but the number of circulating platelets was reduced by about 20%, and their size was slightly increased. Tail bleeding time was normal, and in vivo, the absence of APP did not alter thrombus formation in the femoral artery. In contrast, in a model of vein thrombosis induced by flow restriction in the inferior vena cava, APP-KO mice, as well as chimeric mice with selective deficiency of APP in blood cells, developed much larger thrombi than control animals, and were more sensitive to embolization. Consistent with this, in a pulmonary thromboembolism model, larger vessels were occluded. APP-KO mice displayed a shorter APTT, but not PT, when measured in the presence of platelets. Moreover, the activity of factor XIa (FXIa), but not FXIIa, was higher in APP-KO mice compared with controls. APP-KO mice presented a higher number of circulating platelet-leukocyte aggregates, and neutrophils displayed a greater tendency to protrude extracellular traps, which were more strongly incorporated into venous thrombi. These results indicate that platelet APP limits venous thromboembolism through a negative regulation of both fibrin formation and neutrophil function.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is believed to contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we showed that Abeta25-35 rapidly caused activation of autophagy, subsequently leading to reduction of autophagy associated with cellular apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that the accumulation of beta-arrestin 1 (ARRB1) caused by Abeta25-35 contributed to the induction of autophagic flux. The depletion of ARRB1 led to decreases in the expression of LC3B, Atg7, and Beclin-1, which are essential for the initiation of autophagy. ARRB1 depletion also reduced downstream ERK activity and promoted Abeta25-35-induced cell death. As with ARRB1, transient upregulation of ARRB2 by Abeta25-35 was observed after short treatment durations, whereas genetic reduction of ARRB2 caused a marked increase in the expression of the alpha7nAch receptor at the cell surface, which resulted in partial reversal of Abeta25-35-induced cell death. Although expression of both ARRB1 and ARRB2 was reduced in serum from patients with AD, the levels of ARRB1 were much lower than those of ARRB2 in AD. Thus, our findings indicate that ARRB1/2 play different roles in Abeta25-35 cytotoxicity, which may provide additional support for exploring the underlying molecular mechanism of AD.",

    "abstract": "[F-18]-AV-1451, a PET tracer specifically developed to detect brain neurofibrillary tau pathology, has the potential to facilitate accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), staging of brain tau burden and monitoring disease progression. Recent PET studies show that patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia exhibit significantly higher in vivo [F-18]-AV-1451 retention than cognitively normal controls. Importantly, PET patterns of [F-18]-AV-1451 correlate well with disease severity and seem to match the predicted topographic Braak staging of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in AD, although this awaits confirmation. We studied the correlation of autoradiographic binding patterns of [F-18]-AV-1451 and the stereotypical spatiotemporal pattern of progression of NFTs using legacy postmortem brain samples representing different Braak NFT stages (I-VI). We performed [F-18]-AV-1451 phosphor-screen autoradiography and quantitative tau measurements (stereologically based NFT counts and biochemical analysis of tau pathology) in three brain regions (entorhinal cortex, superior temporal sulcus and visual cortex) in a total of 22 cases: low Braak (I-II, n = 6), intermediate Braak (III-IV, n = 7) and high Braak (V-VI, n = 9). Strong and selective [F-18]-AV-1451 binding was detected in all tangle-containing regions matching precisely the observed pattern of PHF-tau immunostaining across the different Braak stages. As expected, no signal was detected in the white matter or other non-tangle containing regions. Quantification of [F-18]-AV-1451 binding was very significantly correlated with the number of NFTs present in each brain region and with the total tau and phospho-tau content as reported by Western blot and ELISA. [F-18]-AV-1451 is a promising biomarker for in vivo quantification of brain tau burden in AD. Neuroimaging-pathologic studies conducted on postmortem material from individuals imaged while alive are now needed to confirm these observations.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is extensively studied, and the involvement of astrocytes and other cell types in this process has been described. However, the responses of astrocytes themselves to amyloid beta peptides ((Abeta; the widely accepted major toxic factor in AD) is less well understood. Here, we show that Abeta(1-42) is toxic to primary cultures of astrocytes. Toxicity does not involve disruption of astrocyte Ca2+ homeostasis, but instead occurs via formation of the toxic reactive species, peroxynitrite. Thus, Abeta(1-42) raises peroxynitrite levels in astrocytes, and Abeta(1-42) toxicity can be inhibited by antioxidants, or by inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) formation (reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NO combine to form peroxynitrite), or by a scavenger of peroxynitrite. Increased ROS levels observed following Abeta(1-42) application were derived from NADPH oxidase. Induction of haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protected astrocytes from Abeta(1-42) toxicity, and this protective effect was mimicked by application of the carbon monoxide (CO) releasing molecule CORM-2, suggesting HO-1 protection was attributable to its formation of CO. CO suppressed the rise of NADPH oxidase-derived ROS caused by Abeta(1-42). Under hypoxic conditions (0.5% O2, 48 h) HO-1 was induced in astrocytes and Abeta(1-42) toxicity was significantly reduced, an effect which was reversed by the specific HO-1 inhibitor, QC-15. Our data suggest that Abeta(1-42) is toxic to astrocytes, but that induction of HO-1 affords protection against this toxicity due to formation of CO. HO-1 induction, or CO donors, would appear to present attractive possible approaches to provide protection of both neuronal and non-neuronal cell types from the degenerative effects of AD in the central nervous system.",

    "title": "Determination of acidity constants and prediction of electrophoretic separation of amyloid beta peptides.",
    "abstract": "In this paper we describe a strategy to estimate by CE the acidity constants (pKa) of complex polyprotic peptides from their building peptide fragments. CE has been used for the determination of the pKas of five short polyprotic peptides that cover all the sequence of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides 1-40 and 1-42 (Abeta fragments 1-15, 10-20, 20-29, 25-35 and 33-42). First, the electrophoretic mobility (me) was measured as a function of pH of the background electrolyte (BGE) in the pH range 2-12 (bare fused silica capillary, I=25mM and T=25 C). Second, the mes were fitted to equations modelling the ionisable behaviour of the different fragments as a function of pH to determine their pKas. The accuracy of the pKas was demonstrated predicting the electrophoretic behaviour of the studied fragments using the classical semiempirical relationships between me and peptide charge-to-mass ratio (me vs. q/Mr1/2, classical polymer model, q=charge and Mr=relative molecular mass). Separation selectivity in a mixture of the fragments as a function of pH was evaluated, taking into account the influence of the electroosmotic flow (EOF) at each pH value, and a method for the simple and rapid simulation of the electropherograms at the optimum separation pH was described. Finally, the pKas of the fragments were used to estimate the pKas of the Abeta peptides 1-40 and 1-42 (tC and D 3.1, E 4.6 and Y 10.8 for acidic amino acids and tN-D 8.6, H 6.0, K 10.6 and R 12.5 for basic amino acids), which were used to predict their behaviour and simulate their electropherograms with excellent results. However, as expected due to the very small differences on q/Mr1/2 values, separation resolution of their mixtures was poor over the whole pH range. The use of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) coated capillaries allowed reducing the EOF and a slight improvement of resolution.",

    "abstract": "Homeostasis of the gut microbiota critically influences host health and aging. Developing genetically engineered probiotics holds great promise as a new therapeutic paradigm to promote healthy aging. Here, through screening 3,983 Escherichia coli mutants, we discovered that 29 bacterial genes, when deleted, increase longevity in the host Caenorhabditis elegans. A dozen of these bacterial mutants also protect the host from age-related progression of tumor growth and amyloid-beta accumulation. Mechanistically, we discovered that five bacterial mutants promote longevity through increased secretion of the polysaccharide colanic acid (CA), which regulates mitochondrial dynamics and unfolded protein response (UPRmt) in the host. Purified CA polymers are sufficient to promote longevity via ATFS-1, the host UPRmt-responsive transcription factor. Furthermore, the mitochondrial changes and longevity effects induced by CA are conserved across different species. Together, our results identified molecular targets for developing pro-longevity microbes and a bacterial metabolite acting on host mitochondria to promote longevity.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease is associated with deposition of the amyloidogenic peptide Abeta in the brain. Passive immunization using Abeta-specific antibodies has been demonstrated to reduce amyloid deposition both in vitro and in vivo Because N-terminally truncated pyroglutamate (pE)-modified Abeta species (AbetapE3) exhibit enhanced aggregation potential and propensity to form toxic oligomers, they represent particularly attractive targets for antibody therapy. Here we present three separate monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize AbetapE3 with affinities of 1-10 nm and inhibit AbetapE3 fibril formation in vitro. In vivo application of one of these resulted in improved memory in AbetapE3 oligomer-treated mice. Crystal structures of Fab-AbetapE3 complexes revealed two distinct binding modes for the peptide. Juxtaposition of pyroglutamate pE3 and the F4 side chain (the \"pEF head\") confers a pronounced bulky hydrophobic nature to the AbetapE3 N terminus that might explain the enhanced aggregation properties of the modified peptide. The deep burial of the pEF head by two of the antibodies explains their high target specificity and low cross-reactivity, making them promising candidates for the development of clinical antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation is a key risk factor to the development of Alzheimer' disease (AD). Aldose reductase (AR) has been found to be widely involved in inflammation-related diseases; however, whether aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) could be used to treat neuroinflammation is rarely reported. This study aims to evaluate the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of two major ARIs of Sorbinil (Sor) and Zopolrestat (Zol) in beta-amyloid protein (Abeta)-induced microglia (BV-2). We find that Sor and Zol significantly inhibit TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 production from microglia in response to Abeta stimulation. Mechanism study showed that Sor and Zol decreased the production of intracellular ROS which resulted in an effective inhibition on the phosphorylation of several protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms including PKCalpha/beta, delta, zeta/lambda and mu. Moreover, Sor and Zol inactivated PCK-associated IKKbeta-IkappaB-NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (JNK, p38, ERK) inflammation pathways. In summary, our findings suggest that Sor and Zol could inhibit Abeta-induced neuroinflammation by regulating ROS/PKC-dependent NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways, indicating that ARIs could be promising agents for treating inflammation-related neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.",

    "abstract": "High levels of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) have been related to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. However, in the healthy brain, low physiologically relevant concentrations of Abeta are necessary for long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory. Because cGMP plays a key role in these processes, here we investigated whether the cyclic nucleotide cGMP influences Abeta levels and function during LTP and memory. We demonstrate that the increase of cGMP levels by the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors sildenafil and vardenafil induces a parallel release of Abeta due to a change in the approximation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1. Moreover, electrophysiological and behavioral studies performed on animals of both sexes showed that blocking Abeta function, by using anti-murine Abeta antibodies or APP knock-out mice, prevents the cGMP-dependent enhancement of LTP and memory. Our data suggest that cGMP positively regulates Abeta levels in the healthy brain which, in turn, boosts synaptic plasticity and memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a key pathogenetic factor in Alzheimer's disease. However, low concentrations of endogenous Abeta, mimicking levels of the peptide in the healthy brain, enhance hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory. Because the second messenger cGMP exerts a central role in LTP mechanisms, here we studied whether cGMP affects Abeta levels and function during LTP. We show that cGMP enhances Abeta production by increasing the APP/BACE-1 convergence in endolysosomal compartments. Moreover, the cGMP-induced enhancement of LTP and memory was disrupted by blockade of Abeta, suggesting that the physiological effect of the cyclic nucleotide on LTP and memory is dependent upon Abeta.",

Linkage disequilibrium score regression of 220 cell types implicated the regulation of myeloid gene expression in AD risk. The minor allele of rs1057233 (G), within the previously reported CELF1 AD risk locus, showed association with delayed AD onset and lower expression of SPI1 in monocytes and macrophages. SPI1 encodes PU.1, a transcription factor critical for myeloid cell development and function. AD heritability was enriched within the PU.1 cistrome, implicating a myeloid PU.1 target gene network in AD. Finally, experimentally altered PU.1 levels affected the expression of mouse orthologs of many AD risk genes and the phagocytic activity of mouse microglial cells. Our results suggest that lower SPI1 expression reduces AD risk by regulating myeloid gene expression and cell function.",

RNPN treatment increased the percent inhibition of superoxide anion and glutathione peroxidase activity, neuronal densities in the cortex and hippocampus, decreased Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-42) and gamma (gamma)-secretase levels, and reduced Abeta plaque observed using immunohistochemistry analysis and thioflavin S staining. Our results suggest that RNPN may be a promising candidate for AD therapy because of its antioxidant properties and reduction in Abeta aggregation, thereby suppressing its adverse side effect.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of nerve growth factor (NGF) and its high-affinity Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) receptor has been suggested to contribute to the selective degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN) associated with the progressive cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this review is to describe our progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the dynamic interplay between NGF/TrkA signaling and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism within the context of AD neuropathology. This is mainly based on the finding that TrkA receptor binding to APP depends on a minimal stretch of ~20 amino acids located in the juxtamembrane/extracellular domain of APP that carries the alpha- and beta-secretase cleavage sites. Here, we provide evidence that: (i) NGF could be one of the \"routing\" proteins responsible for modulating the metabolism of APP from amyloidogenic towards non-amyloidogenic processing via binding to the TrkA receptor; (ii) the loss of NGF/TrkA signaling could be linked to sporadic AD contributing to the classical hallmarks of the neuropathology, such as synaptic loss, beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) deposition and tau abnormalities. These findings will hopefully help to design therapeutic strategies for AD treatment aimed at preserving cholinergic function and anti-amyloidogenic activity of the physiological NGF/TrkA pathway in the septo-hippocampal system.",

    "abstract": "Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 have been shown to be the main components of the amyloid plaques found in the extracellular environment of neurons in Alzheimer's disease. beta-Casein, a milk protein, has been shown to display a remarkable chaperone ability in preventing the aggregation of proteins. In this study, the ability of beta-casein to suppress the amyloid fibril formation of Abeta1-42 has been examined through in vitro studies and molecular docking simulation. The results demonstrate the inhibitory effect of beta-casein on fibril formation in Abeta1-42, in a concentration dependent manner, suggesting that the chaperone binds to the Abeta1-42 and prevents amyloid fibril formation. Molecular docking results show that the inhibitory effect of the beta-casein may be due to binding of the chaperone with the aggregation-prone region of the Abeta1-42 mainly via hydrophobic interactions. beta-Casein probably binds to the CHC and C-terminal domain of the Abeta1-42, and stabilizes proteins by inhibiting the conversion of monomeric Abeta1-42 into fibrils. Thus our data suggests that the hydrophobic interactions between beta-casein and Abeta1-42 play an important role in the burial of the hydrophobic part of the Abeta1-42. This means that beta-casein maybe considered for use in preventing amyloid fibril formation in degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer.",

Abeta peptide can undergo specific amino acid posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, that are important for modulating its proteolytic degradation, aggregation, binding to lipid membranes and neurotoxic functions. Peptides phosphorylated at serine 8 in full-length Abeta42 (pAbeta42) were synthesised and compared to native Abeta42 peptide. Their secondary structures, aggregation properties and interactions with plasma membranes of primary cortical neurons were investigated. The results revealed that pAbeta42 has increased beta-sheet formation with rapid amyloid formation in a synthetic lipid environment, which was associated with increased cellular binding but concomitant diminished neurotoxicity. Our data support the notion that phosphorylation of Abeta42 promotes the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain, which lack the neurotoxic properties associated with oligomeric species causing pathogenesis in AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease, characterized by progressive decline in memory and cognitive functions, that results from loss of neurons in the brain. Amyloid beta (Abeta) protein and oxidative stress are major contributors to Alzheimer's disease, therefore, protecting neuronal cells against Abeta-induced toxicity and oxidative stress might form an effective approach for treatment of this disease. 3,5,4'-trihydroxy-6,7,3'-trimethoxyflavone (TTF) is a flavonoid we have purified from the plant Achillea fragrantissima; and the present study examined, for the first time, the effects of this compound on Abeta-toxicity to neuronal cells. METHODS: Various chromatographic techniques were used to isolate TTF from the plant Achillea fragrantissima, and an N2a neuroblastoma cell line was used to study its activities. The cellular levels of total and phosphorylated stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) and of total and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK 1/2) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured by using 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA). Cytotoxicity and cell viability were assessed by using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in cell-conditioned media, or by crystal violet cell staining, respectively. RESULTS: TTF prevented the Abeta-induced death of neurons and attenuated the intracellular accumulation of ROS following treatment of these cells with Abeta. TTF also inhibited the Abeta-induced phosphorylation of the signaling proteins SAPK/JNK and ERK 1/2, which belong to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. CONCLUSION: TTF should be studied further as a potential therapeutic means for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent form of dementia in the elderly but the precise causal mechanisms are still not fully understood. Growing evidence supports a significant role for Abeta42 oligomers in the development and progression of Alzheimer's. For example, intracellular soluble Abeta oligomers are thought to contribute to the early synaptic dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect are still unclear. Here, we identify a novel mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the reported synaptic dysfunction. Using primary rat hippocampal neurons exposed for a short period of time to Abeta42 oligomers, we show a disruption in the activity-dependent phosphorylation cycle of SynapsinI at Ser9. SynapsinI is a pre-synaptic protein that responds to neuronal activity and regulates the availability of synaptic vesicles to participate in neurotransmitter release. Phosphorylation of SynapsinI at Ser9, modulates its distribution and interaction with synaptic vesicles. Our results show that in neurons exposed to Abeta42 oligomers, the levels of phosphorylated Ser9 of SynapsinI remain elevated during the recovery period following neuronal activity. We then investigated if this effect could be targeted by a putative therapeutic regime using valproic acid (a short branch-chained fatty acid) that has been proposed as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Exposure of Abeta42 treated neurons to valproic acid, showed that it restores the physiological regulation of SynapsinI after depolarisation. Our data provide a new insight on Abeta42-mediated pathology in Alzheimer's disease and supports the use of Valproic acid as a possible pharmaceutical intervention for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Isolating of primary motor neurons from animal embryos is critical for the study of neurological disease including mechanistic discovery and therapeutic development. Density gradient centrifuge taking advantage of the buoyant of motor neuron permits the enrichment of motor neurons. Despite the metrizamide, an OptiPrep medium has been introduced to separate the motor neurons by gradient centrifuge. NEW METHOD: We hereby used single density gradient of OptiPrep medium to isolate the spinal motor neurons from the fetal mouse. RESULTS: Single density gradient of OptiPrep medium is effective to isolate spinal motor neurons from the fetal mouse. The immunofluorescence staining analysis showed that the purity of cultured motor neurons at 72h was between 90% and 95%. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: Four gradients of OptiPrep medium have been previously used to isolate the motor neurons from spinal cord of mouse. In this study, the single gradient of OptiPrep medium was demonstrated to effectively isolate spinal motor neurons from the fetal mouse. CONCLUSIONS: The single gradient of OptiPrep medium is enough to produce high purity of spinal motor neurons from the fetal mouse.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the formation of amyloid aggregates, which are formed due to improper folding of proteins leading to the aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) 42 peptide. Inhibition of Abeta 42 aggregation using a drug such as carbenoxolone (Cbx), which has already been stated as neuroprotective, appears to be an effective approach against AD. OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to investigate the anti-fibrillation activity of Cbx against the Abeta 42 aggregation. METHODS: The aggregation of Abeta 42 peptide was observed by performing in-vitro studies and the propensity of aggregation of Abeta 42 peptide was evaluated by the prediction of binding sites and amyloidogenic regions. The binding of Cbx in these binding sites was predicted by computational studies. RESULTS: Thioflavin-T (Th-T assay), congo red assay and circular dichroism (CD) analysis suggested significant inhibition of Abeta 42 aggregation by Cbx. The propensity of aggregation of Abeta 42 peptide was evaluated by the prediction of binding sites and amyloidogenic regions. The mechanism of anti-fibrillation activity of Cbx was elucidated by molecular docking and simulation studies and has been predicted to interact with amyloidogenic residues of Abeta 42 peptides as well as fibrils. Cbx also interacts with residues involved in the stabilization of the oligomeric structure. CONCLUSION: These results project Cbx as a suitable candidate for the inhibition of Abeta 42 aggregation and the therapeutic potential of Cbx against AD can further be studied using in-vivo experiments.",

Unfortunately, the structural elucidation and separation of these different amino acid types in peptides has been analytically challenging to date due to the numerous isomers present, limiting our knowledge about their existence and biological roles. Here, we utilized an ultrahigh resolution ion mobility spectrometry platform coupled with mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) to separate amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides containing l-aspartic acid, d-aspartic acid, l-isoaspartic acid, and d-isoaspartic acid residues which span alpha- and beta-linked amino acids in both d- and l-forms.

    "abstract": "Decreased clearance of potentially toxic metabolites, due to aging changes, likely plays a significant role in the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and other macromolecules in the brain of the elderly and in the patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aging is the single most important risk factor for AD development. Abeta transport receptor proteins expressed at the blood-brain barrier are significantly altered with age: the efflux transporters lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 and P-glycoprotein are reduced, whereas the influx transporter receptor for advanced glycation end products is increased. These receptors play an important role in maintaining brain biochemical homeostasis. We now report that, in a rat model of aging, gene transcription is altered in aging, as measured by Abeta receptor gene messenger RNA (mRNA) at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 36 months. Gene mRNA expression from isolated cerebral microvessels was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 and P-glycoprotein mRNA were significantly reduced in aging, and receptor for advanced glycation end products was increased, in parallel with the changes seen in receptor protein expression. Transcriptional changes appear to play a role in aging alterations in blood-brain barrier receptor expression and Abeta accumulation.",

INT-131, a novel, non-thiazolidinedione compound that belongs to a new family of drugs, selective PPARgamma modulators (SPPARMs), has provided an emerging opportunity for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. However, its role in the central nervous system has not been studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the putative neuroprotective role of INT131 in hippocampal neurons. We found that INT131 increased dendritic branching, promoted neuronal survival against Abeta amyloid, increased expression of PGC1-1alpha and modulated neuronal mitochondrial dynamics.

Structural variations of the oligomers without and with EGCG were monitored and analyzed in detail. It has been found that EGCG prevents the formation of Abeta oligomer through two different ways by either accelerating the Abeta oligomerization or reducing the beta-content of the hexamer. It also decreases the potential \"highly toxic\" conformations of Abeta oligomer, which is related to the conformations having high order beta-sheet sizes. Both electrostatic and van der Waals interaction energies are found to be involved to the binding process. Computed results using quantum chemical methods show that the pi-pi stacking is a critical factor of the interaction between EGCG and the peptides. As a result, the binding free energy of the EGCG to the Abeta peptides is slightly larger than that of the curcumin.",

The higher incidence of AD among women indicates that sex is one of the main risk factor for developing the disease. Using the transgenic amyloid precursor protein x presenilin 1 (APPxPS1) mouse model of AD, we investigated sex inequality with regards to memory capacities and hippocampal plasticity. We report that spatial memory is strongly affected in APPxPS1 females while remarkably spared in males, at all ages tested. Given the contribution of adult neurogenesis to hippocampal-dependent memory processes, we examined whether impaired neurogenesis could account for age-related decline of memory functions in APPxPS1 mice. We show that not only limited numbers of new neurons are generated in these mice, but also, that new granule cells display reduced capacity for synaptic connectivity, a default that is exacerbated in females. Moreover, high densities of hypertrophic astrocytes are observed in the dentate gyrus of APPxPS1 females specifically. By revealing sex-dependent hippocampal alterations, our data may provide causal explanation to APPxPS1 females' memory deficits.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral hypoperfusion is an early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that influences the progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Understanding the mechanism is of critical importance in the search for new effective therapies. We hypothesized that cerebral hypoperfusion promotes the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and degenerative changes in the brain and is a potential mechanism contributing to development of dementia. To address this, we studied the effects of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion induced by bilateral carotid artery stenosis on Abeta peptide pools in a transgenic mouse model of AD (transgenic mice with Swedish, Dutch and Iowa mutations in human amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Tg-SwDI)). Cerebrovascular integrity was characterized by quantifying the occurrence of microinfarcts and haemorrhages and compared with wild-type mice without Abeta. A significant increase in soluble Abeta peptides (Abeta40/42) was detected after 1 month of hypoperfusion in the parenchyma in parallel with elevated APP and APP proteolytic products. Following 3 months, a significant increase in insoluble Abeta40/42 was determined in the parenchyma and vasculature. Microinfarct load was significantly increased in the Tg-SwDI as compared with wild-type mice and further exacerbated by hypoperfusion at 1 and 3 months. In addition, the number of Tg-SwDI hypoperfused mice with haemorrhages was increased compared with hypoperfused wild-type mice. Soluble parenchymal Abeta was associated with elevated NADPH oxidase-2 (NOX2) which was exacerbated by 1-month hypoperfusion. We suggest that in response to hypoperfusion, increased Abeta production/deposition may contribute to degenerative processes by triggering oxidative stress promoting cerebrovascular disruption and the development of microinfarcts.",

    "title": "Ethanol-induced PGE2 up-regulates Abeta production through PKA/CREB signaling pathway.",
    "abstract": "Ethanol abuse aggravates dementia-associated cognitive defects through the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. Beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) has been considered as a key regulator of AD pathogenesis by controlling amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation. In addition, previous studies reported that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and neuroinflammation have been proposed in ethanol-induced neurodegeneration. Thus, we investigated the role of ER stress and PGE2, a neuroinflammation mediator, in the ethanol-stimulated BACE1 expression and Abeta production. Using the human-derived neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-MC, the results show that ethanol up-regulated BACE1 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Ethanol stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which induced CHOP expression and eIF2alpha phosphorylation. PBA (an ER stress inhibitor) attenuated the ethanol-increased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and PGE2 production. By using salubrinal (an eIF2alpha dephosphorylation inhibitor) or EIF2A siRNA, we found that eIF2alpha phosphorylation mediated the ethanol-induced COX-2 expression. In addition, COX-2-induced BACE1 up-regulation was abolished by NS-398 (a selective COX-2 inhibitor). And, PF-04418948 (an EP-2 receptor inhibitor) pretreatment reduced ethanol-induced PKA activation and CREB phosphorylation as well as ethanol-stimulated Abeta production. Furthermore, 14-22 amide (a PKA inhibitor) pretreatment or CREB1 siRNA transfection suppressed the ethanol-induced BACE1 expression. In conclusion, ethanol-induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation stimulates COX-2 expression and PGE2 production which induces the BACE1 expression and Abeta production via EP-2 receptor-dependent PKA/CREB pathway.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neuronal cell apoptosis is an important pathological change in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated and extracted from Coptidis and rhizome and Cortex phellodendri, has a wide range of pharmacological effects. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of Berberine against neuronal insults induced by Abeta25-35 in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. METHODS: Primary neuron cells have been isolated from hippocampus of C57BL/6 newborn mice. We investigated effect of Berberine against neuronal insults induced by Abeta25-35 in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling, MTT, Propidium iodide, MMP, Caspase activity measurement, Western blot. RESULT: These neurons explosure to the beta25-35 protein resulted in a loss in cell viability and a surge in apoptosis. However, the presence of Berberine significantly reversed the effects induced by Abeta25-35. Through decreasing viability and caspase activity in neurons, the pretreatment with Berberine attenuated the cytotoxic effect of the Abeta25-35. Furthermore, it's found that expression of cytochrome C, as well as the restoration of Bcl-2/Bax and Bcl-xl/Bax ratio in the presence of Berberine, led to a decline in the apoptotic rate. CONCLUSION: The neuroprotective effects of Berberine against Abeta25-35-induced neuronal apoptosis, suggesting that this may be a promising therapeutics against AD.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) and metal ions are associated with oxidative stress in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Oxidative stress, acting on omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains, produces diverse products, including 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), which can covalently modify the Abeta that helped to produce it. To examine possible feedback mechanisms involving Abeta, metal ions and HNE production, the effects of HNE modification and fibril formation on metal ion binding was investigated. Results indicate that copper(II) generally inhibits the modification of His side chains in Abeta by HNE, but that once modified, copper(II) still binds to Abeta with high affinity. Fibril formation protects only one of the three His residues in Abeta from HNE modification, and this protection is consistent with proposed models of fibril structure. These results provide insight into a network of biochemical reactions that may be operating as a consequence of oxidative stress in AD, or as part of the pathogenic process.",

We previously demonstrated that pre-treatment with LPS derived from Pantoea agglomerans (LPSp) activated amyloid beta (Abeta) phagocytosis in mouse primary microglia. In the present study, we further examined the promotory effect on phagocytosis of phagocytic particles in the C8-B4 microglia cell line. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phagocytic analysis of C8-B4 cells was evaluated using phagocytic particles (latex beads or HiLyte  Fluor 488-conjugated Abeta1-42). RESULTS: The phagocytic activity of latex beads was dependent on the concentration of beads and incubation time. LPSp, at as low as 100 pg/ml, significantly increased phagocytosis against the beads. In the experiment of Abeta1-42 phagocytosis, LPSp significantly increased Abeta phagocytic activity. CONCLUSION: LPSp treatment was confirmed to enhance Abeta1-42 phagocytosis by mouse microglia. It is suggested that the use of LPSp may be a potential promising candidate for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease.",

A series of novel 2-arylethenylquinoline derivatives were synthesized and evaluated in our previous study, which inhibited Abeta aggregation in vitro effectively at the concentration of 20 mumol/L and exhibited high antioxidant activity. In order to verify the capacity of anti-AD in vivo, the transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) strain CL2355 expressing neural Abeta was employed as the AD model to investigate the neuroprotective activity of seven high-potential compounds (4a1, 4a2, 4b1, 4b2, 4c1, 4c2, 4c3) selected from those derivatives. Learning memory associated chemotaxis assay was performed to evaluate the neural repairment capacity. The underlying mechanism was investigated by mRNA analysis of Abeta gene and heat shock protein genes (hsp-16.1 and hsp-16.2) and Western blot of Abeta. Our data indicated that among seven tested compound, 4b1 and 4c2 reduced Abeta-induced stress, suppressed the expression of neural Abeta monomers and toxic oligomers, and recovered the damaged associative learning memory in C. elegans AD model. These findings further confirmed their potentials to become valuable agents for AD therapy.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglial cells after activated play critical roles in development of neuroinflammation, and may accelerate the progression of AD. Andrographolide (ANDRO), a potent naturally extracted substance, has been demonstrated to exert suppressive effects on LPS-induced inflammation by modulating macrophage and microglia overactivation. Whereas in AD, beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides have been considered as a potent activator of neuroinflammation, the effect of ANDRO on Abeta-induced neuroinflammation has not been examined. In this study, we investigated the effects of ANDRO on Abeta(1-42)-induced neuroinflammation. We found that ANDRO significantly protected neuronal cells against microglia-mediated Abeta(1-42) toxicity and attenuated the release of preinflammatory productions such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). It also downregulated the protein levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in microglial cells. Further the involved mechanism study demonstrated that ANDRO inhibited the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) by affecting IkappaB phosphorylation, and attenuated Abeta(1-42)-induced JNK-MAPK overactivation. In summary, this study, for the first time, revealed ANDRO reduced inflammation-mediated neuronal damage by blocking inflammatory responses of microglial cells to Abeta(1-42), suggesting ANDRO may be an effective agent in modulating neuroinflammatory process in AD.",

Here we investigated whether increased microglial phagocytic activity that clears amyloid can also cause pathological synapse loss. We identified TDP-43, a DNA-RNA binding protein encoded by the Tardbp gene, as a strong regulator of microglial phagocytosis. Mice lacking TDP-43 in microglia exhibit reduced amyloid load in a model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but at the same time display drastic synapse loss, even in the absence of amyloid. Clinical examination from TDP-43 pathology cases reveal a considerably reduced prevalence of AD and decreased amyloid pathology compared to age-matched healthy controls, confirming our experimental results. Overall, our data suggest that dysfunctional microglia might play a causative role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, critically modulating the early stages of cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Brain accumulation of soluble oligomers of the amyloid-beta peptide (AbetaOs) is increasingly considered a key early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A variety of AbetaO species have been identified, both in vitro and in vivo, ranging from dimers to 24mers and higher order oligomers. However, there is no consensus in the literature regarding which AbetaO species are most germane to AD pathogenesis. Antibodies capable of specifically recognizing defined subpopulations of AbetaOs would be a valuable asset in the identification, isolation, and characterization of AD-relevant AbetaO species. Here, we report the characterization of a human single chain antibody fragment (scFv) denoted NUsc1, one of a number of scFvs we have identified that stringently distinguish AbetaOs from both monomeric and fibrillar Abeta. NUsc1 readily detected AbetaOs previously bound to dendrites in cultured hippocampal neurons. In addition, NUsc1 blocked AbetaO binding and reduced AbetaO-induced neuronal oxidative stress and tau hyperphosphorylation in cultured neurons. NUsc1 further distinguished brain extracts from AD-transgenic mice from wild type (WT) mice, and detected endogenous AbetaOs in fixed AD brain tissue and AD brain extracts. Biochemical analyses indicated that NUsc1 targets a subpopulation of AbetaOs with apparent molecular mass greater than 50 kDa. Results indicate that NUsc1 targets a particular AbetaO species relevant to AD pathogenesis, and suggest that NUsc1 may constitute an effective tool for AD diagnostics and therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and progressive neurological disorder, and amyloid-beta (Abeta) has been recognized as the major cause of AD. Inhibiting Abeta production and/or enhancing the clearance of Abeta to reduce its levels are still the effective therapeutic strategies pursued in anti-AD research. In previous studies, we have reported that selenomethionine (Se-Met), a major form of selenium in animals and humans with significant antioxidant capacity, can reduce both amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation in a triple transgenic mouse model of AD. In this study, a Se-Met treatment significantly decreased the Abeta levels in Neuron-2a/AbetaPPswe (N2asw) cells, and the anti-amyloid effect of Se-Met was attributed to its ability to inhibit Abeta generation by suppressing the activity of BACE1. Furthermore, both the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and the number of LC3-positive puncta were significantly decreased in Se-Met-treated cells, suggesting that Se-Met also promoted Abeta clearance by modulating the autophagy pathway. Subsequently, Se-Met inhibited the initiation of autophagy through the AKT-mTOR-p70S6K signaling pathway and enhanced autophagic turnover by promoting autophagosome-lysosome fusion and autophagic clearance. Our results further highlight the potential therapeutic effects of Se-Met on AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of progressive cognitive impairment in the aged. The aggregation of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is a hallmark of AD and is linked to synapse loss and cognitive impairment. Capsaicin, a specific agonist of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), has been proven to ameliorate stress-induced AD-like pathological and cognitive impairments, but it is unclear whether TRPV1 activation can affect cognitive and synaptic functions in Abeta-induced mouse model of AD. In this study, we investigated the effects of TRPV1 activation on spatial memory and synaptic plasticity in mice treated with Abeta. To induce AD-like pathological and cognitive impairments, adult C57Bl/6 mice were microinjected with Abeta42 (100 muM, 2.5 mul/mouse, i.c.v.). Two weeks after Abeta42 microinjection, spatial learning and memory as well as hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) were examined. The results showed that Abeta42 microinjection significantly impaired spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests compared with controls. These behavioral changes were accompanied by synapse loss and impaired LTP in the CA1 area of hippocampus. More importantly, daily capsaicin (1 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment throughout the experiment dramatically improved spatial learning and memory and synaptic function, as reflected by enhanced hippocampal LTP and reduced synapse loss, whereas the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment had no effects on cognitive and synaptic function in Abeta42-treated mice. These results indicate that TRPV1 activation by capsaicin rescues cognitive deficit in the Abeta42-induced mouse model of AD both structurely and functionally.",

    "abstract": "Oligomeric amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta-42) peptides are considered to be the most toxic species connected to the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease. However, not all aggregation conditions promote oligomer formation in vitro, raising the question whether oligomer formation in vivo also requires a specific suitable cellular environment. We recently found that interaction with neuronal membranes initiates aggregation of Abeta-42 and neuronal uptake. Our data suggest that small molecules in the extracellular space can facilitate the formation of membrane-active Abeta-42 oligomers. We analyzed the early stage of Abeta-42 aggregation in the presence of glucose and sucrose and found that these sugars strongly favor Abeta-42 oligomer formation. We characterized oligomers by dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy, immuno-transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy. We found that Abeta-42 spontaneously and rapidly forms low molecular weight oligomers in the presence of sugars. Slightly acidic pH (6.7-7) greatly favors oligomer formation when compared to the extracellular physiological pH (7.4). Circular dichroism demonstrated that these Abeta-42 oligomers did not adopt a beta-sheet structure. Unstructured oligomeric Abeta-42 interacted with membrane bilayers of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUV) and neuronal model cells, facilitated cellular uptake of Abeta-42, and inhibition of mitochondrial activity. Our data therefore suggest that elevated concentrations of glucose within the range observed in diabetic individuals (10 mM) facilitate the formation of membrane-active Abeta-42 oligomers.",

    "abstract": "Microglia are essential for CNS homeostasis and innate neuroimmune function, and play important roles in neurodegeneration and brain aging. Here we present gene expression profiles of purified microglia isolated at autopsy from the parietal cortex of 39 human subjects with intact cognition. Overall, genes expressed by human microglia were similar to those in mouse, including established microglial genes CX3CR1, P2RY12 and ITGAM (CD11B). However, a number of immune genes, not identified as part of the mouse microglial signature, were abundantly expressed in human microglia, including TLR, Fcgamma and SIGLEC receptors, as well as TAL1 and IFI16, regulators of proliferation and cell cycle. Age-associated changes in human microglia were enriched for genes involved in cell adhesion, axonal guidance, cell surface receptor expression and actin (dis)assembly. Limited overlap was observed in microglial genes regulated during aging between mice and humans, indicating that human and mouse microglia age differently.",

In this study, each or all phenylalanine (Phe) residues at the 4th, 19th, and 20th positions of Abeta-(1-40) were substituted by hydrophobic cyclohexylalanine (Cha), which is sterically similar to Phe, but lacks pi-electrons, to reveal effects of interactions involving pi-electrons on the aggregation of Abeta both in aqueous solution and GM1-containing membranes. We found that each Cha substitution significantly inhibited fibril formation by Abeta, indicating a pivotal role of aromatic interactions.

    "title": "Key aromatic/hydrophobic amino acids controlling a cross-amyloid peptide interaction versus amyloid self-assembly.",
    "abstract": "The interaction of the intrinsically disordered polypeptide islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), which is associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D), with the Alzheimer's disease amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide modulates their self-assembly into amyloid fibrils and may link the pathogeneses of these two cell-degenerative diseases. However, the molecular determinants of this interaction remain elusive. Using a systematic alanine scan approach, fluorescence spectroscopy, and other biophysical methods, including heterocomplex pulldown assays, far-UV CD spectroscopy, the thioflavin T binding assay, transmission EM, and molecular dynamics simulations, here we identified single aromatic/hydrophobic residues within the amyloid core IAPP region as hot spots or key residues of its cross-interaction with Abeta40(42) peptide. Importantly, we also find that none of these residues in isolation plays a key role in IAPP self-assembly, whereas simultaneous substitution of four aromatic/hydrophobic residues with Ala dramatically impairs both IAPP self-assembly and hetero-assembly with Abeta40(42). Furthermore, our experiments yielded several novel IAPP analogs, whose sequences are highly similar to that of IAPP but have distinct amyloid self- or cross-interaction potentials. The identified similarities and major differences controlling IAPP cross-peptide interaction with Abeta40(42) versus its amyloid self-assembly offer a molecular basis for understanding the underlying mechanisms. We propose that these insights will aid in designing intervention strategies and novel IAPP analogs for the management of type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, or other diseases related to IAPP dysfunction or cross-amyloid interactions.",

The aggregation ability and toxicity of Abeta peptides are highly associated with the sequence and conformation. A discordant helix is a helical segment with a tendency to form a beta-strand conformation and has been found in many amyloid-like proteins or peptides. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the properties of a Abeta discordant helix and its impact on the Abeta structure, aggregation ability and cytotoxicity. In an Abeta sequence, a discordant helical region located at residue 15-26 has been proposed. This discordant helix plays a vital role in Abeta conformation, aggregation ability and cytotoxicity. Any factors which can stabilize the structure of the discordant helix may lead to the prevention of aggregation and toxicity of Abeta. This makes the discordant helix an attractive target for the design of new drugs for the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is associated with the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain. In particular, the 42-amino acid form, Abeta1-42, is thought to play a key role in the disease. It is therefore of interest that diverse compounds, known as gamma-secretase modulators (GSM), can selectively decrease Abeta1-42 production without inhibiting the production of other forms of Abeta. Here we describe the novel discovery of synergistic inhibition of Abeta by certain combinations of GSMs. Cell cultures were treated with pairwise combinations of GSMs to determine how Abeta peptide production was affected. Analysis of isobolograms and calculation of the combination index showed that BMS-869780 and GSM-2 were highly synergistic. Additional combinations of GSMs revealed that inhibition of Abeta occurred only when one GSM was of the \"acid GSM\" structural class and the other was of the \"non-acid GSM\" class. A total of 15 representative acid/non-acid GSM combinations were shown to inhibit Abeta production, whereas 10 pairwise combinations containing two acid GSMs or containing two non-acid GSMs did not inhibit Abeta. We also discovered that lasalocid, a natural product, is a potent GSM. Lasalocid is unique in that it did not synergize with other GSMs. Synergism did not translate in vivo perhaps because of biochemical differences between the cell culture model and brain. These findings reinforce the pharmacological differences between different structural classes of GSMs, and may help to exploit the potential of gamma-secretase as a drug target.",

In females, higher free testosterone and gonadotropin levels were associated with lower cerebral Abeta positivity. In males, free testosterone was positively related to hippocampal volume with significant interaction with cognitive status. Further subgroup analyses showed that the association was significant only in impaired cognition but not in normal cognition. Free estradiol was not associated with Abeta burden or hippocampal neurodegeneration in either sex.

Here, we designed and synthesized iminodiacetic acid-conjugated nanoparticles (IDA-NP) to modulate Abeta42 aggregation and reduce the cytotoxicity accelerated by Zn2+. Results showed that IDA-NP enabled high metal-chelate capacity (752mumol/g) and potent inhibition capability against Abeta42 fibrillation. Zn2+ ions could be completely removed by chelating to IDA-NP, which leads to the recovery of on-pathway Abeta42 fibrillation. Then, the special surface character of IDA-NP inhibited Abeta42 fibrillation. As a result, IDA-NP protected SH-SY5Y cells from the cytotoxicity induced by Zn2+-Abeta42 species, as evidenced by about 80% (from 47.6% to 86.3%) increase of the cell viability. The research proved that IDA-NP was a potent bifunctional nano-modulator for preventing Zn2+-mediated Abeta aggregation and cytotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Gadolinium (Gd)-stained MRI is based on Gd contrast agent (CA) administration into the brain parenchyma. The strong signal increase induced by Gd CA can be converted into resolution enhancement to record microscopic MR images. Moreover, inhomogeneous distribution of the Gd CA in the brain improves the contrast between different tissues and provides new contrasts in MR images. Gd-stained MRI detects amyloid plaques, one of the microscopic lesions of Alzheimer's disease (AD), in APPSL/PS1M146L mice or in primates. Numerous transgenic mice with various plaque typologies have been developed to mimic cerebral amyloidosis and comparison of plaque detection between animal models and humans with new imaging methods is a recurrent concern. Here, we investigated detection of amyloid plaques by Gd-stained MRI in five mouse models of amyloidosis (APPSL/PS1M146L, APP/PS1dE9, APP23, APPSwDI, and 3xTg) presenting with compact, diffuse and intracellular plaques as well as in post mortem human-AD brains. The brains were then evaluated by histology to investigate the impact of size, compactness, and iron load of amyloid plaques on their detection by MRI. We show that Gd-stained MRI allows detection of compact amyloid plaques as small as 25 microm, independently of their iron load, in mice as well as in human-AD brains.",

    "abstract": "Ferritin, an iron storage and regulation protein, has been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, it has not been investigated in preclinical AD, detected by neocortical amyloid-beta load (NAL), before cognitive impairment. Cross-sectional analyses were carried out for plasma and serum ferritin in participants in the Kerr Anglican Retirement Village Initiative in Aging Health cohort. Subjects were aged 65-90 years and were categorized into high and low NAL groups via positron emission tomography using a standard uptake value ratio cutoff=1.35. Ferritin was significantly elevated in participants with high NAL compared with those with low NAL, adjusted for covariates age, sex, apolipoprotein E e4 carriage and levels of C-reactive protein (an inflammation marker). Ferritin was also observed to correlate positively with NAL. A receiver operating characteristic curve based on a logistic regression of the same covariates, the base model, distinguished high from low NAL (area under the curve (AUC)=0.766), but was outperformed when plasma ferritin was added to the base model (AUC=0.810), such that at 75% sensitivity, the specificity increased from 62 to 71% on adding ferritin to the base model, indicating that ferritin is a statistically significant additional predictor of NAL over and above the base model. However, ferritin's contribution alone is relatively minor compared with the base model. The current findings suggest that impaired iron mobilization is an early event in AD pathogenesis. Observations from the present study highlight ferritin's potential to contribute to a blood biomarker panel for preclinical AD.",

    "title": "Novel functions of CCM1 delimit the relationship of PTB/PH domains.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Three NPXY motifs and one FERM domain in CCM1 makes it a versatile scaffold protein for tethering the signaling components together within the CCM signaling complex (CSC). The cellular role of CCM1 protein remains inadequately expounded. Both phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains were recognized as structurally related but functionally distinct domains. METHODS: By utilizing molecular cloning, protein binding assays and RT-qPCR to identify novel cellular partners of CCM1 and its cellular expression patterns; by screening candidate PTB/PH proteins and subsequently structurally simulation in combining with current X-ray crystallography and NMR data to defined the essential structure of PTB/PH domain for NPXY-binding and the relationship among PTB, PH and FERM domain(s). RESULTS: We identified a group of 28 novel cellular partners of CCM1, all of which contain either PTB or PH domain(s), and developed a novel classification system for these PTB/PH proteins based on their relationship with different NPXY motifs of CCM1. Our results demonstrated that CCM1 has a wide spectrum of binding to different PTB/PH proteins and perpetuates their specificity to interact with certain PTB/PH domains through selective combination of three NPXY motifs. We also demonstrated that CCM1 can be assembled into oligomers through intermolecular interaction between its F3 lobe in FERM domain and one of the three NPXY motifs. Despite being embedded in FERM domain as F3 lobe, F3 module acts as a fully functional PH domain to interact with NPXY motif. The most salient feature of the study was that both PTB and PH domains are structurally and functionally comparable, suggesting that PTB domain is likely evolved from PH domain with polymorphic structural additions at its N-terminus. CONCLUSIONS: A new beta1A-strand of the PTB domain was discovered and new minimum structural requirement of PTB/PH domain for NPXY motif-binding was determined. Based on our data, a novel theory of structure, function and relationship of PTB, PH and FERM domains has been proposed, which extends the importance of the NPXY-PTB/PH interaction on the CSC signaling and/or other cell receptors with great potential pointing to new therapeutic strategies. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The study provides new insight into the structural characteristics of PTB/PH domains, essential structural elements of PTB/PH domain required for NPXY motif-binding, and function and relationship among PTB, PH and FERM domains.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the extent to which pathogenic factors drive the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) at different stages of the long preclinical and clinical phases. Given that the aggregation of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is an important factor in AD pathogenesis, we asked whether Abeta seeds from brain extracts of mice at different stages of amyloid deposition differ in their biological activity. Specifically, we assessed the effect of age on Abeta seeding activity in two mouse models of cerebral Abeta amyloidosis (APPPS1 and APP23) with different ages of onset and rates of progression of Abeta deposition. Brain extracts from these mice were serially diluted and inoculated into host mice. Strikingly, the seeding activity (seeding dose SD50) in extracts from donor mice of both models reached a plateau relatively early in the amyloidogenic process. When normalized to total brain Abeta, the resulting specific seeding activity sharply peaked at the initial phase of Abeta deposition, which in turn is characterized by a temporary several-fold increase in the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio. At all stages, the specific seeding activity of the APPPS1 extract was higher compared to that of APP23 brain extract, consistent with a more important contribution of Abeta42 than Abeta40 to seed activity. Our findings indicate that the Abeta seeding potency is greatest early in the pathogenic cascade and diminishes as Abeta increasingly accumulates in brain. The present results provide experimental support for directing anti-Abeta therapeutics to the earliest stage of the pathogenic cascade, preferably before the onset of amyloid deposition.",

    "abstract": "We have described a novel C-to-T mutation in the APP gene that corresponds to an alanine to valine substitution at position 673 in APP (A673V), or position 2 of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) sequence. This mutation is associated with the early onset of AD-type dementia in homozygous individuals, whereas it has a protective effect in the heterozygous state. Correspondingly, we observed differences in the aggregation properties of the wild-type and mutated Abeta peptides and their mixture. We have carried out neutron diffraction (ND) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments on magnetically-oriented fibers of Abeta1-28WT and its variant Abeta1-28A2V. The orientation propensity was higher for Abeta1-28A2V suggesting that it promotes the formation of fibrillar assemblies. The diffraction patterns by Abeta1-28WT and Abeta1-28A2V assemblies differed in shape and position of the equatorial reflections, suggesting that the two peptides adopt distinct lateral packing of the diffracting units. The diffraction patterns from a mixture of the two peptides differed from those of the single components, indicating the presence of structural interference during assembly and orientation. The lowest orientation propensity was observed for a mixture of Abeta1-28WT and a short N-terminal fragment, Abeta1-6A2V, which supports a role of Abeta's N-terminal domain in amyloid fibril formation.",

We examined whether a widely used commercial immunoassay for CSF Abeta42, tau, and ptau provided stable measurements for more than ~10 years. METHODS: INNOTEST assay values for CSF Abeta42, tau, and ptau from Washington University in St. Louis and VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, were evaluated. RESULTS: Abeta42 values as measured by the INNOTEST assay drifted upward by approximately 3% per year over the past decade. Tau values remained relatively stable, whereas results for ptau were mixed. DISCUSSION: Assay drift may reduce statistical power or even confound analyses. The drift in INNOTEST Abeta42 values may reduce diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease in the clinic. We recommend methods to account for assay drift in existing data sets and to reduce assay drift in future studies.",

    "title": "Abeta truncated species: Implications for brain clearance mechanisms and amyloid plaque deposition.",
    "abstract": "Extensive parenchymal and vascular Abeta deposits are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Besides classic full-length peptides, biochemical analyses of brain deposits have revealed high degree of Abeta heterogeneity likely resulting from the action of multiple proteolytic enzymes. In spite of the numerous studies focusing in Abeta, the relevance of N- and C-terminal truncated species for AD pathogenesis remains largely understudied. In the present work, using novel antibodies specifically recognizing Abeta species N-terminally truncated at position 4 or C-terminally truncated at position 34, we provide a clear assessment of the differential topographic localization of these species in AD brains and transgenic models. Based on their distinct solubility, brain N- and C-terminal truncated species were extracted by differential fractionation and identified via immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry analysis. Biochemical/biophysical studies with synthetic homologues further confirmed the different solubility properties and contrasting fibrillogenic characteristics of the truncated species composing the brain Abeta peptidome. Abeta C-terminal degradation leads to the production of more soluble fragments likely to be more easily eliminated from the brain. On the contrary, N-terminal truncation at position 4 favors the formation of poorly soluble, aggregation prone peptides with high amyloidogenic propensity and the potential to exacerbate the fibrillar deposits, self-perpetuating the amyloidogenic loop. Detailed assessment of the molecular diversity of Abeta species composing interstitial fluid and amyloid deposits at different disease stages, as well as the evaluation of the truncation profile during various pharmacologic approaches will provide a comprehensive understanding of the still undefined contribution of Abeta truncations to the disease pathogenesis and their potential as novel therapeutic targets.",

    "title": "Large Perivascular Spaces Visible on Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Progression, and Risk of Dementia: The Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study.",
    "abstract": "Importance: With advancing age, an increased visibility of perivascular spaces (PVSs) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is hypothesized to represent impaired drainage of interstitial fluid from the brain and may reflect underlying cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). However, whether large perivascular spaces (L-PVSs) (>3 mm in diameter) visible on MRI are associated with SVD and cognitive deterioration in older individuals is unknown. Objective: To examine whether L-PVSs are associated with the progression of the established MRI markers of SVD, cognitive decline, and increased risk of dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants: The prospective, population-based Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study assessed L-PVSs at baseline (September 1, 2002, through February 28, 2006) on MRI studies of the brain in 2612 participants. Participants returned for additional MRI from April 1, 2007, through September 30, 2011, and underwent neuropsychological testing at the 2 time points a mean (SD) of 5.2 (0.2) years apart. Data analysis was conducted from August 1, 2016, to May 4, 2017. Exposures: The presence, number, and location of L-PVSs. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident subcortical infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, and progression of white matter hyperintensities detected on MRI; cognitive decline defined as composite score changes between baseline and follow-up in the domains of memory, information processing speed, and executive function; and adjudicated incident dementia cases diagnosed according to international guidelines. Results: Of the 2612 study patients (mean [SD] age, 74.6 [4.8] years; 1542 [59.0%] female), 424 had L-PVSs and 2188 did not. The prevalence of L-PVSs was 16.2% (median number of L-PVSs, 1; range, 1-17). After adjusting for age, sex, and interval between baseline and follow-up scanning, the presence of L-PVSs was significantly associated with an increased risk of incident subcortical infarcts (adjusted risk ratio, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.76-3.68) and microbleeds (adjusted risk ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.18-1.72) and a greater 5-year progression of white matter hyperintensity volume. The presence of L-PVSs was also associated with a steeper decline in information processing speed and more than quadrupled the risk of vascular dementia. All associations persisted when further adjusted for genetic and cerebrovascular risk factors. The associations with cognitive outcomes were independent of educational level, depression, and other SVD MRI markers. Conclusions and Relevance: Large PVSs are an MRI marker of SVD and associated with the pathogenesis of vascular-related cognitive impairment in older individuals. Large PVSs should be included in assessments of vascular cognitive impairment in the older population and as potential targets for interventions.",

We examined change in brain amyloid-beta accumulation via the positron emission tomography tracer [11C] Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) across 2 data collection cycles, spaced 3 years apart, and decline in cognitive functioning in 58 adults with DS without clinical AD. PiB retention increased in the anterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus cortex, parietal cortex, and anterior ventral striatum. Across the 2 cycles, 14 (27.5%) participants were consistently PiB+, 31 (60.8%) were consistently PiB-, and 6 (11.7%) converted from PiB- at cycle 1 to PiB+ at cycle 2. Increased global amyloid-beta was related to decline in verbal episodic memory, visual episodic memory, executive functioning, and fine motor processing speed. Participants who were consistently PiB+ demonstrated worsening of episodic memory, whereas participants who were consistently PiB- evidenced stable or improved performance. Amyloid-beta accumulation may be a contributor to or biomarker of declining cognitive functioning in preclinical AD in DS.",

Despite the small size of these lesions, affected individuals can have hundreds to thousands of cerebral microinfarcts, which cause measurable disruption to structural brain connections, and are associated with dementia that is independent of Alzheimer's disease pathology or larger infarcts (ie, lacunar infarcts, and large cortical and non-lacunar subcortical infarcts). Substantial progress has been made with regard to understanding risk factors and functional consequences of cerebral microinfarcts, partly driven by new in-vivo detection methods and the development of animal models that closely mimic multiple aspects of cerebral microinfarcts in human beings. Evidence from these advances suggests that cerebral microinfarcts can be manifestations of both small vessel and large vessel disease, that cerebral microinfarcts are independently associated with cognitive impairment, and that these lesions are likely to cause damage to brain structure and function that extends beyond their actual lesion boundaries. Criteria for the identification of cerebral microinfarcts with in-vivo MRI are provided to support further studies of the association between these lesions and cerebrovascular disease and dementia.",

Biomarkers of functional impairment, neuronal loss, and protein deposition that can be assessed by neuroimaging (ie, MRI and PET) or CSF analysis are increasingly being used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease in research studies and specialist clinical settings. However, the validation of the clinical usefulness of these biomarkers is incomplete, and that is hampering reimbursement for these tests by health insurance providers, their widespread clinical implementation, and improvements in quality of health care. We have developed a strategic five-phase roadmap to foster the clinical validation of biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease, adapted from the approach for cancer biomarkers. Sufficient evidence of analytical validity (phase 1 of a structured framework adapted from oncology) is available for all biomarkers, but their clinical validity (phases 2 and 3) and clinical utility (phases 4 and 5) are incomplete. To complete these phases, research priorities include the standardisation of the readout of these assays and thresholds for normality, the evaluation of their performance in detecting early disease, the development of diagnostic algorithms comprising combinations of biomarkers, and the development of clinical guidelines for the use of biomarkers in qualified memory clinics.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) play an important role in the degeneration of neurons and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Current evidence indicates that high levels of cholesterol-which increase the risk of developing AD-can influence Abeta production in neurons. However, it remains unclear how altered level/subcellular distribution of cholesterol in astrocytes can influence APP metabolism. In this study, we evaluated the effects of cholesterol transport inhibitor U18666A-a class II amphiphile that triggers redistribution of cholesterol within the endosomal-lysosomal (EL) system-on APP levels and metabolism in rat primary cultured astrocytes. Our results revealed that U18666A increased the levels of the APP holoprotein and its cleaved products (alpha-/beta-/eta-CTFs) in cultured astrocytes, without altering the total levels of cholesterol or cell viability. The cellular levels of Abeta1-40 were also found to be markedly increased, while secretory levels of Abeta1-40 were decreased in U18666A-treated astrocytes. We further report a corresponding increase in the activity of the enzymes regulating APP processing, such as alpha-secretase, beta-secretase, and gamma-secretase as a consequence of U18666A treatment. Additionally, APP-cleaved products are partly accumulated in the lysosomes following cholesterol sequestration within EL system possibly due to decreased clearance. Interestingly, serum delipidation attenuated enhanced levels of APP and its cleaved products following U18666A treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that cholesterol sequestration within the EL system in astrocytes can influence APP metabolism and the accumulation of APP-cleaved products including Abeta peptides, which can contribute to the development of AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "The main pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the formation of abundant amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques in the human brain. Studies have reported that Abeta from the AD brain is resistant to proteolytic digestion, which may explain why Abeta cannot be readily eliminated from this organ. However, there are only a few studies that address this important question. We used the AD transgenic mouse (APP/PS1) model to show that Abeta derived from the brain of the old mouse is resistant to proteolytic digestion. This was in contrast to the proteinase K-sensitive human Abeta peptide, whose amino acid sequence was identical to that of AD mouse-derived Abeta but whose conformation was different (i.e., the native protein, but not the peptide, folded into a three-dimensional conformation). To address this question, we denatured AD mouse-derived Abeta with urea and found that Abeta became proteinase K-sensitive. This phenomenon was concentration-dependent, and these results were confirmed by another protein denaturant, guanidinium hydrochloride. We recovered the conformation of the denatured AD mouse-derived Abeta by eliminating urea and adding the human Abeta peptide, and we found that human Abeta was converted to the proteinase K-resistant form in the presence of partially undenatured AD mouse-derived Abeta. However, upon the addition of the rat Abeta peptide, there were no Abeta proteinase K-resistant fragments. Our results show that the resistance of AD mouse-derived Abeta to proteolytic digestion is dependent on the three-dimensional conformation of Abeta. In summary, this study provides new insights on why Abeta plaques fail to be degraded in the human brain.",

    "abstract": "This study reports the identification and characterization of markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in aged sheep (Ovis aries) as a preliminary step toward making a genetically modified large animal model of AD. Importantly, the sequences of key proteins involved in AD pathogenesis are highly conserved between sheep and human. The processing of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein is conserved between sheep and human, and sheep Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratios in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are also very similar to human. In addition, total tau and neurofilament light levels in CSF are comparable with those found in human. The presence of neurofibrillary tangles in aged sheep brain has previously been established; here, we report for the first time that plaques, the other pathologic hallmark of AD, are also present in the aged sheep brain. In summary, the biological machinery to generate the key neuropathologic features of AD is conserved between the human and sheep, making the sheep a good candidate for future genetic manipulation to accelerate the condition for use in pathophysiological discovery and therapeutic testing.",

    "title": "Butyrylcholinesterase-knockout reduces fibrillar beta-amyloid and conserves 18FDG retention in 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder causing dementia. One hallmark of the AD brain is the deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques. AD is also a state of cholinergic dysfunction and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) associates with Abeta pathology. A transgenic mouse (5XFAD) is an aggressive amyloidosis model, producing Abeta plaques with which BChE also associates. A derived strain (5XFAD/BChE-KO), with the BChE gene knocked out, has significantly lower fibrillar Abeta than 5XFAD mice at the same age. Therefore, BChE may have a role in Abeta pathogenesis. Furthermore, in AD, diminished glucose metabolism in the brain can be detected in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging following 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (18FDG) administration. To determine whether hypometabolism is related to BChE-induced changes in fibrillar Abeta burden, whole brain and regional uptake of 18FDG in 5XFAD and 5XFAD/BChE-KO mice was compared to corresponding wild-type (WT5XFAD and WTBChE-KO) strains at 5months. Diminished fibrillar Abeta burden was confirmed in 5XFAD/BChE-KO mice relative to 5XFAD. 5XFAD and 5XFAD/BChE-KO mice demonstrated reduction in whole brain 18FDG retention compared to respective wild-types. Regional analysis of relevant AD structures revealed reduction in 18FDG retention in 5XFAD mice in all brain regions analyzed (save cerebellum) compared to WT5XFAD. Alternatively, 5XFAD/BChE-KO mice demonstrated a more selective pattern of reduced retention in the cerebral cortex and thalamus compared to WTBChE-KO, while retention in hippocampal formation, amygdala and basal ganglia remained unchanged. This suggests that in knocking out BChE and reducing fibrillar Abeta, a possible protective effect on brain function may be conferred in a number of structures in 5XFAD/BChE-KO mice.",

    "abstract": "The production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a key factor driving pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increasing concentrations of soluble Abeta oligomers within the brain lead to synapse degeneration and the progressive dementia characteristic of AD. Since Abeta exists in both disease-relevant (toxic) and non-toxic forms, the factors that affected the release of toxic Abeta were studied in a cell model. 7PA2 cells expressing the human amyloid precursor protein released Abeta oligomers that caused synapse damage when incubated with cultured neurones. These Abeta oligomers had similar potency to soluble Abeta oligomers derived from the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Although the conditioned media from 7PA2 cells treated with the cellular prion protein (PrPC) contained Abeta, it did not cause synapse damage. The loss of toxicity was associated with a reduction in Abeta oligomers and an increase in Abeta monomers. The suppression of toxic Abeta release was dependent on the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor attached to PrPC, and treatment of cells with specific GPIs alone reduced the production of toxic Abeta. The efficacy of GPIs was structure-dependent and the presence of sialic acid was critical. The conditioned medium from GPI-treated cells protected neurones against Abeta oligomer-induced synapse damage; neuroprotection was mediated by Abeta monomers. These studies support the hypothesis that the ratio of Abeta monomers to Abeta oligomers is a critical factor that regulates synapse damage.",

    "abstract": "Protofibrils of the 42 amino acids long amyloid-beta peptide are transient pre-fibrillar intermediates in the process of peptide aggregation into amyloid plaques and are thought to play a critical role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Hence, there is a need for research reagents and potential diagnostic reagents for detection and imaging of such aggregates. Here we describe an in vitro selection of Affibody molecules that bind to protofibrils of Abeta42cc, which is a stable engineered mimic of wild type Abeta42 protofibrils. Several binders were identified that bind Abeta42cc protofibrils with low nanomolar affinities, and which also recognize wild type Abeta42 protofibrils. Dimeric head-to-tail fusion proteins with subnanomolar binding affinities, and very slow dissociation off-rates, were also constructed. A mapping of the chemical properties of the side chains onto the Affibody scaffold surface reveals three distinct adjacent surface areas of positively charged surface, nonpolar surface and a polar surface, which presumably match a corresponding surface epitope on the protofibrils. The results demonstrate that the engineered Abeta42cc is a suitable antigen for directed evolution of affinity reagents with specificity for wild type Abeta42 protofibrils.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Identifying physiologically relevant binding partners of amyloid-beta (Abeta) that modulate in vivo fibril formation may yield new insights into Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology. Human cathelicidin peptide, LL-37, is an innate immune effector and modulator, ubiquitous in human tissues and expressed in myriad cell types. OBJECTIVE: We present in vitro experimental evidence and discuss findings supporting a novel hypothesis that LL-37 binds to Abeta42 and can modulate Abeta fibril formation. METHODS: Specific interactions between LL-37 and Abeta (with Abeta in different aggregation states, assessed by capillary electrophoresis) were demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi). Morphological and structural changes were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Neuroinflammatory and cytotoxic effects of LL-37 alone, Abeta42 alone, and LL-37/Abeta complexes were evaluated in human microglia and neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY5Y). RESULTS: SPRi shows binding specificity between LL-37 and Abeta, while TEM shows that LL-37 inhibits Abeta42 fibril formation, particularly Abeta's ability to form long, straight fibrils characteristic of AD. CD reveals that LL-37 prevents Abeta42 from adopting its typical beta-type secondary structure. Microglia-mediated toxicities of LL-37 and Abeta42 to neurons are greatly attenuated when the two peptides are co-incubated prior to addition. We discuss the complementary biophysical characteristics and AD-related biological activities of these two peptides. CONCLUSION: Based on this body of evidence, we propose that LL-37 and Abeta42 may be natural binding partners, which implies that balanced (or unbalanced) spatiotemporal expression of the two peptides could impact AD initiation and progression.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Both amyloid (Abeta) load and APOE4 allele are associated with neurodegenerative changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) prone regions and with risk for cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the unique and independent contribution of APOE4 allele status (E4+\\E4-), Abeta status (Amy+\\Amy-), and combined APOE4 and Abeta status on regional cortical thickness (CoTh) and cognition among participants diagnosed as cognitively normal (CN, n = 251), early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI, n = 207), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI, n = 196), and mild AD (n = 162) from the ADNI. METHODS: A series of two-way ANCOVAs with post-hoc Tukey HSD tests, controlling independently for Abeta and APOE4 status and age were examined. RESULTS: Among LMCI and AD participants, cortical thinning was widespread in association with Amy+ status, whereas in association with E4+ status only in the inferior temporal and medial orbito-frontal regions. Among CN and EMCI participants, E4+ status, but not Amy+ status, was independently associated with increased CoTh, especially in limbic regions [e.g., in the entorhinal cortex, CoTh was 0.123 mm greater (p = 0.002) among E4+ than E4-participants]. Among CN and EMCI, both E4+ and Amy+ status were independently associated with cognitive impairment, which was greatest among those with combined E4 + and Amy+ status. CONCLUSION: Decreased CoTh is independently associated with Amy+ status in many brain regions, but with E4+ status in very restricted number of brain regions. Among CN and EMCI participants, E4 + status is associated with increased CoTh, in medial and inferior temporal regions, although cognitive impairment at this state is independently associated with Amy+ and E4 + status. These findings imply a unique pathophysiological mechanism for E4 + status in AD and its progression.",

Blood tests to detect biomarkers, such as amyloid and total Tau protein, are among the most promising diagnostic methods due to their low cost, low risk, and ease of operation. However, such biomarkers in blood occur at extremely low levels and are difficult to detect precisely. In the early 2000s, a highly sensitive assay technology, immunomagnetic reduction (IMR), was developed. IMR involves the use of antibody-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles dispersed in aqueous solution. The concentrations of detected molecules are converted to reductions in the ac magnetic susceptibility of this reagent due to the association between the magnetic nanoparticles and molecules. To achieve ultra-high sensitivity, a high-Tc superconducting-quantum-interference-device (SQUID) ac magnetosusceptometer was designed and applied to detect the tiny reduction in the ac magnetic susceptibility of the reagent. Currently, a 36-channeled high-Tc SQUID-based ac magnetosusceptometer is available. Using the reagent and this analyzer, extremely low concentrations of amyloid and total Tau protein in human plasma could be detected. Further, the feasibility of identifying subjects in early-stage AD via assaying plasma amyloid and total Tau protein is demonstrated. The results show a diagnostic accuracy for prodromal AD higher than 80% and reveal the possibility of screening for early-stage AD using SQUID-based IMR.",

    "abstract": "The study determined the effect of thymoquinone rich fraction (TQRF) and thymoquinone (TQ) in the forms of nano- and conventional emulsions on learning and memory, lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant status, antioxidants genes expression and soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels in rats fed with a high fat-cholesterol diet (HFCD). The TQRF was extracted from Nigella sativa seeds using a supercritical fluid extraction system and prepared into nanoemulsion, which later named as TQRF nanoemulsion (TQRFNE). Meanwhile, TQ was acquired commercially and prepared into thymoquinone nanoemulsion (TQNE). The TQRF and TQ conventional emulsions (CE), named as TQRFCE and TQCE, respectively were studied for comparison. Statin (simvastatin) and non-statin (probucol) cholesterol-lowering agents, and a mild-to-severe Alzheimer's disease drug (donepezil) were served as control drugs. The Sprague Dawley rats were fed with HFCD for 6 months, and treated with the intervention groups via oral gavage daily for the last 3 months. As a result, HFCD-fed rats exhibited hypercholesterolaemia, accompanied by memory deficit, increment of lipid peroxidation and soluble Abeta levels, decrement of total antioxidant status and down-regulation of antioxidants genes expression levels. TQRFNE demonstrated comparable effects to the other intervention groups and control drugs in serum biomarkers as well as in the learning and memory test. Somehow, TQRFNE was more prominent than those intervention groups and control drugs in brain biomarkers concomitant to gene and protein expression levels. Supplementation of TQRFNE into an HFCD thus could ameliorate memory deficit, lipid peroxidation and soluble Abeta levels as well as improving the total antioxidant status and antioxidants genes expression levels.",

In this study, the effect of silibinin on Abeta-induced anxiety/depression-like behaviors in rats was investigated. Silibinin significantly attenuated anxiety/depression-like behaviors caused by Abeta1-42-treatment as shown in tail suspension test (TST), elevated plus maze (EPM) and forced swimming tests (FST). Moreover, silibinin was able to attenuate the neuronal damage in the hippocampus of Abeta1-42-injected rats. Silibinin-treatment up-regulated the function through BDNF/TrkB pathway and attenuated autophagy in the hippocampus.

    "title": "Early-Onset Alzheimer Disease and Candidate Risk Genes Involved in Endolysosomal Transport.",
    "abstract": "Importance: Mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 lead to early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) but account for only approximately 11% of EOAD overall, leaving most of the genetic risk for the most severe form of Alzheimer disease unexplained. This extreme phenotype likely harbors highly penetrant risk variants, making it primed for discovery of novel risk genes and pathways for AD. Objective: To search for rare variants contributing to the risk for EOAD. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case-control study, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in 51 non-Hispanic white (NHW) patients with EOAD (age at onset <65 years) and 19 Caribbean Hispanic families previously screened as negative for established APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 causal variants. Participants were recruited from John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics, Case Western Reserve University, and Columbia University. Rare, deleterious, nonsynonymous, or loss-of-function variants were filtered to identify variants in known and suspected AD genes, variants in multiple unrelated NHW patients, variants present in 19 Hispanic EOAD WES families, and genes with variants in multiple unrelated NHW patients. These variants/genes were tested for association in an independent cohort of 1524 patients with EOAD, 7046 patients with late-onset AD (LOAD), and 7001 cognitively intact controls (age at examination, >65 years) from the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium. The study was conducted from January 21, 2013, to October 13, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: Alzheimer disease diagnosed according to standard National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria. Association between Alzheimer disease and genetic variants and genes was measured using logistic regression and sequence kernel association test-optimal gene tests, respectively. Results: Of the 1524 NHW patients with EOAD, 765 (50.2%) were women and mean (SD) age was 60.0 (4.9) years; of the 7046 NHW patients with LOAD, 4171 (59.2%) were women and mean (SD) age was 77.4 (8.6) years; and of the 7001 NHW controls, 4215 (60.2%) were women and mean (SD) age was 77.4 (8.6) years. The gene PSD2, for which multiple unrelated NHW cases had rare missense variants, was significantly associated with EOAD (P = 2.05 x 10-6; Bonferroni-corrected P value [BP] = 1.3 x 10-3) and LOAD (P = 6.22 x 10-6; BP = 4.1 x 10-3). A missense variant in TCIRG1, present in a NHW patient and segregating in 3 cases of a Hispanic family, was more frequent in EOAD cases (odds ratio [OR], 2.13; 95% CI, 0.99-4.55; P = .06; BP = 0.413), and significantly associated with LOAD (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.37-3.62; P = 7.2 x 10-4; BP = 5.0 x 10-3). A missense variant in the LOAD risk gene RIN3 showed suggestive evidence of association with EOAD after Bonferroni correction (OR, 4.56; 95% CI, 1.26-16.48; P = .02, BP = 0.091). In addition, a missense variant in RUFY1 identified in 2 NHW EOAD cases showed suggestive evidence of an association with EOAD as well (OR, 18.63; 95% CI, 1.62-213.45; P = .003; BP = 0.129). Conclusions and Relevance: The genes PSD2, TCIRG1, RIN3, and RUFY1 all may be involved in endolysosomal transport-a process known to be important to development of AD. Furthermore, this study identified shared risk genes between EOAD and LOAD similar to previously reported genes, such as SORL1, PSEN2, and TREM2.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is thought to play an essential pathogenic role in Alzheimer s disease (AD). A key enzyme involved in the generation of Abeta is the beta-secretase BACE, for which powerful inhibitors have been developed and are currently in use in human clinical trials. However, although BACE inhibition can reduce cerebral Abeta levels, whether it also can ameliorate neural circuit and memory impairments remains unclear. Using histochemistry, in vivo Ca2+ imaging, and behavioral analyses in a mouse model of AD, we demonstrate that along with reducing prefibrillary Abeta surrounding plaques, the inhibition of BACE activity can rescue neuronal hyperactivity, impaired long-range circuit function, and memory defects. The functional neuronal impairments reappeared after infusion of soluble Abeta, mechanistically linking Abeta pathology to neuronal and cognitive dysfunction. These data highlight the potential benefits of BACE inhibition for the effective treatment of a wide range of AD-like pathophysiological and cognitive impairments.",

We determined the mRNA and protein levels of Abeta metabolism-associated enzymes including neprilysin (NEP), insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice using real-time PCR and western blotting. Spatial memory was measured in APP/PS1 mice using the Morris water maze. The phosphorylation of AKT, ERK, p38, and JNK was determined using western blotting. RESULTS: The levels of soluble Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice after CART treatment. CART modulated the levels of NEP, IDE, RAGE, and LRP-1. In addition, CART inhibited the MAPK pathways and activated the AKT pathway, whereas inhibition of the AKT pathway decreased the levels of IDE and LRP-1. Furthermore, CART attenuated spatial memory deficits in the APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSION: CART decreases the levels of soluble Abeta in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice by modulating the expression of Abeta metabolism-associated enzymes, which may be associated with the MAPK and AKT pathways.",

    "title": "Neuronal P2X7 Receptors Revisited: Do They Really Exist?",
    "abstract": "P2X7 receptors (Rs) constitute a subclass of ATP-sensitive ionotropic receptors (P2X1-P2X7). P2X7Rs have many distinguishing features, mostly based on their long intracellular C terminus regulating trafficking to the cell membrane, protein-protein interactions, and post-translational modification. Their C-terminal tail is especially important in enabling the transition from the nonselective ion channel mode to a membrane pore allowing the passage of large molecules. There is an ongoing dispute on the existence of neuronal P2X7Rs with consequences for our knowledge on their involvement in neuroinflammation, aggravating stroke, temporal lobe epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and various neurodegenerative diseases. Whereas early results appeared to support the operation of P2X7Rs at neurons, more recently glial P2X7Rs are increasingly considered as indirect causes of neuronal effects. Specific tools for P2X7Rs are of limited value because of the poor selectivity of agonists, and the inherent failure of antibodies to differentiate between the large number of active and inactive splice variants, or gain-of-function and loss-of-function small nucleotide polymorphisms of the receptor. Unfortunately, the available P2RX7 knock-out mice generated by pharmaceutical companies possess certain splice variants, which evade inactivation. In view of the recently discovered bidirectional dialogue between astrocytes and neurons (and even microglia and neurons), we offer an alternative explanation for previous data, which assumedly support the existence of P2X7Rs at neurons. We think that the unbiased reader will follow our argumentation on astrocytic or microglial P2X7Rs being the primary targets of pathologically high extracellular ATP concentrations, although a neuronal localization of these receptors cannot be fully excluded either.",

However, subsequent studies using new pharmacological and biomolecular tools provided conclusive evidence supporting the existence of functional P2X7Rs in neurons. The P2X7 receptor has since been shown to play a leading role in multiple aspects of neuronal physiology, including axonal elongation and branching and neurotransmitter release. P2X7R has also been implicated in neuronal pathologies, in which it may influence neuronal survival.

Extensive research has been conducted with the aim to reveal the structures of the neurotoxic Abeta aggregates. However, the exact structure of pathological aggregates and mechanism of the disease still remains elusive due to complexity of the occurring processes and instability of various disease-relevant Abeta species.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is the major form of dementia. As AD is an irreversible disease, it is necessary to focus on earlier intervention. However, the potential biomarkers of preclinical AD are still not clear. In this study, urinary metabolomics based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed for delineating the metabolic changes and potential early biomarkers in APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice. A total of 24 differentially regulated metabolites were identified when comparing transgenic mice to wild-type mice using multivariate statistical analysis. Among them, 10 metabolites were significantly upregulated and 14 metabolites were downregulated. On the basis of these potential biomarkers, metabolic pathway analysis found that pentose and glucuronate interconversions, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, the citrate cycle, tryptophan metabolism, and arginine and proline metabolism were disturbed in APP/PS1 mice. Our study revealed that levels of endogenous metabolites in the urine of APP/PS1 mice changed prior to the emergence of learning and cognitive impairment, which may be associated with abnormal nitric oxide production pathways and metabolic disorders of monoaminergic neurotransmitters. In conclusion, this study showed that metabolomics provides an early indicator of disease occurrence for AD.",

Moreover, intracellular TDP-43-positive inclusions are often found in other neurodegenerative diseases. Recently it was shown that zinc ions can provoke the aggregation of endogenous TDP-43 in cells, allowing to assume a direct interaction of TDP-43 with zinc ions. In this work, we investigated zinc binding to the 102-269 TDP-43 fragment, which comprise the two RNA recognition motifs. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, mass spectrometry, and differential scanning fluorimetry, we showed that zinc binds to this TDP-43 domain with a dissociation constant in the micromolar range and modifies its tertiary structure leading to a decrease of its thermostability. Moreover, the study by dynamic light scattering and negative stain electron microscopy demonstrated that zinc ions induce auto-association process of this TDP-43 fragment into rope-like structures. These structures are thioflavin-T-positive allowing to hypothesize the direct implication of zinc ions in pathological aggregation of TDP-43.",

The mechanism should be enhanced by Abeta antibodies that form immune complexes (ICs) with Abeta, and therefore may be relevant to current Abeta immunotherapy approaches. METHODS: Multidisciplinary methods were employed to demonstrate enhanced complement-mediated capture of Abeta antibody immune complexes compared with Abeta alone in both erythrocytes and THP1-derived macrophages. RESULTS: Abeta antibodies dramatically increased complement activation and opsonization of Abeta, followed by commensurately enhanced Abeta capture by human erythrocytes and macrophages. These in vitro findings were consistent with enhanced peripheral clearance of intravenously administered Abeta antibody immune complexes in nonhuman primates. DISCUSSION: Together with our previous results, showing significant Alzheimer's disease deficits in peripheral Abeta clearance, the present findings strongly suggest that peripheral mechanisms should not be ignored as contributors to the effects of Abeta immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "An essential feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is implicated in brain energy metabolic impairment that is considered underlying pathogenesis of cognitive impairment. Therefore, therapeutic interventions to allay cognitive deficits that target energy metabolism may be an efficacy strategy in AD. In this study, we found that electroacupuncture (EA) at the DU20 acupoint obviously increased glucose metabolism in specific brain regions such as cortex, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, basal forebrain septum, brain stem, and cerebellum in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by animal 18F-Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-Glucose (18F-FDG)/positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, accompanied by cognitive improvements in the spatial reference learning and memory and memory flexibility and novel object recognition performances. Further evidence shown energy metabolism occurred in neurons or non-neuronal cells of the cortex and hippocampus in terms of the co-location of GLUT3/NeuN and GLUT1/GFAP. Simultaneously, metabolic homeostatic factors were critical for glucose metabolism, including phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and AKT serine/threonine kinase. Furthermore, EA-induced phosphorylated AMPK and AKT inhibited the phosphorylation level of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to decrease the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the cortex and hippocampus. These findings are concluded that EA is a potential therapeutic target for delaying memory decline and Abeta deposition of AD. The AMPK and AKT are implicated in the EA-induced cortical and hippocampal energy metabolism, which served as a contributor to improving cognitive function and Abeta deposition in a transgenic mouse model of AD.",

Many lines of evidence also indicate that dysregulation of microglia contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and behavioral diseases. These observations provide a compelling argument to more clearly define the mechanisms that control microglia identity and function in health and disease. In this Review, we present a conceptual framework for how different classes of transcription factors interact to select and activate regulatory elements that control microglia development and their responses to internal and external signals. We then describe functions of specific transcription factors in normal and pathological contexts and conclude with a consideration of open questions to be addressed in the future.",

By comparing immune cell composition and cell profiles between the brain compartment and blood, we were able to characterize previously undescribed cell subsets of CD8 T cells, B cells, NK cells and dendritic cells in the naive brain. Using flow cytometry, we show differential distributions of immune populations between meninges, choroid plexus and parenchyma. We demonstrate the phenotypic ranges of resident myeloid cells and identify CD44 as a marker for infiltrating immune populations.

    "title": "Monoamine oxidase B is elevated in Alzheimer disease neurons, is associated with gamma-secretase and regulates neuronal amyloid beta-peptide levels.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increased levels of the pathogenic amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), released from its precursor by the transmembrane protease gamma-secretase, are found in Alzheimer disease (AD) brains. Interestingly, monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) activity is also increased in AD brain, but its role in AD pathogenesis is not known. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that the increased MAO-B expression in AD brain starts several years before the onset of the disease. Here, we show a potential connection between MAO-B, gamma-secretase and Abeta in neurons. METHODS: MAO-B immunohistochemistry was performed on postmortem human brain. Affinity purification of gamma-secretase followed by mass spectrometry was used for unbiased identification of gamma-secretase-associated proteins. The association of MAO-B with gamma-secretase was studied by coimmunoprecipitation from brain homogenate, and by in-situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) in neurons as well as mouse and human brain sections. The effect of MAO-B on Abeta production and Notch processing in cell cultures was analyzed by siRNA silencing or overexpression experiments followed by ELISA, western blot or FRET analysis. Methodology for measuring relative intraneuronal MAO-B and Abeta42 levels in single cells was developed by combining immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy with quantitative image analysis. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry revealed MAO-B staining in neurons in the frontal cortex, hippocampus CA1 and entorhinal cortex in postmortem human brain. Interestingly, the neuronal staining intensity was higher in AD brain than in control brain in these regions. Mass spectrometric data from affinity purified gamma-secretase suggested that MAO-B is a gamma-secretase-associated protein, which was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and PLA, and a neuronal location of the interaction was shown. Strikingly, intraneuronal Abeta42 levels correlated with MAO-B levels, and siRNA silencing of MAO-B resulted in significantly reduced levels of intraneuronal Abeta42. Furthermore, overexpression of MAO-B enhanced Abeta production. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that MAO-B levels are increased not only in astrocytes but also in pyramidal neurons in AD brain. The study also suggests that MAO-B regulates Abeta production in neurons via gamma-secretase and thereby provides a key to understanding the relationship between MAO-B and AD pathogenesis. Potentially, the gamma-secretase/MAO-B association may be a target for reducing Abeta levels using protein-protein interaction breakers.",

    "title": "Sensitivity of restriction spectrum imaging to memory and neuropathology in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diffusion imaging has demonstrated sensitivity to structural brain changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there remains a need for a more complete characterization of microstructural alterations occurring at the earliest disease stages, and how these changes relate to underlying neuropathology. This study evaluated the sensitivity of restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), an advanced diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, to microstructural brain changes in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. METHODS: MRI and neuropsychological test data were acquired from 31 healthy controls, 12 individuals with MCI, and 13 individuals with mild AD, aged 63-93 years. Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta levels were measured in a subset (n = 38) of participants. RSI measures of neurite density (ND) and isotropic free water (IF) were computed in fiber tracts and in hippocampal and entorhinal cortex gray matter, respectively. Analyses evaluated whether these measures predicted memory performance, correlated with amyloid-beta levels, and distinguished impaired individuals from controls. For comparison, analyses were repeated with standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity. RESULTS: Both RSI and DTI measures correlated with episodic memory and disease severity. RSI, but not DTI, measures correlated with amyloid-beta42 levels. ND and FA in the arcuate fasciculus and entorhinal cortex IF most strongly predicted recall performance. RSI measures of arcuate fasciculus ND and entorhinal cortex IF best discriminated memory impaired participants from healthy participants. CONCLUSIONS: RSI is highly sensitive to microstructural changes in the early stages of AD, and is associated with biochemical markers of AD pathology. Reduced ND in cortical association fibers and increased medial temporal lobe free-water diffusion predicted episodic memory, distinguished cognitively impaired from healthy individuals, and correlated with amyloid-beta. Although further research is needed to assess the sensitivity of RSI to preclinical AD and disease progression, these results suggest that RSI may be a promising tool to better understand neuroanatomical changes in AD and their association with neuropathology.",

    "abstract": "The brain mechanisms underlying the effect of intellectual enrichment may evolve along the normal aging Alzheimer's disease (AD) cognitive spectrum and may include both protective and compensatory mechanisms. We assessed the association between early intellectual enrichment (education, years) and average cortical florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio as well as performed voxel-wise analyses in a total of 140 participants, including cognitively normal older adults, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD patients. Higher education was associated with lower cortical florbetapir positron emission tomography (florbetapir-PET) uptake, notably in the frontal lobe in normal older adults, but with higher uptake in frontal, temporal, and parietal regions in MCI after controlling for global cognitive status. No association was found in AD. In MCI, we observed an increased fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) uptake with education within the regions of higher florbetapir-PET uptake, suggesting a compensatory increase. Early intellectual enrichment may be associated with protection and compensation for amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition later in life, before the onset of dementia. Previous investigations have been controversial as regard to the effects of intellectual enrichment variables on Abeta deposition; the present findings call for approaches aiming to evaluate mechanisms of resilience across disease stages.",

    "abstract": "Although a large proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) accumulate misfolded aggregates composed of the islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), its role in the disease is unknown. Here, we show that pancreatic IAPP aggregates can promote the misfolding and aggregation of endogenous IAPP in islet cultures obtained from transgenic mouse or healthy human pancreas. Islet homogenates immunodepleted with anti-IAPP-specific antibodies were not able to induce IAPP aggregation. Importantly, intraperitoneal inoculation of pancreatic homogenates containing IAPP aggregates into transgenic mice expressing human IAPP dramatically accelerates IAPP amyloid deposition, which was accompanied by clinical abnormalities typical of T2D, including hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and a substantial reduction on beta cell number and mass. Finally, induction of IAPP deposition and diabetic abnormalities were also induced in vivo by administration of IAPP aggregates prepared in vitro using pure, synthetic IAPP. Our findings suggest that some of the pathologic and clinical alterations of T2D might be transmissible through a similar mechanism by which prions propagate in prion diseases.",

    "title": "A protocol for quantitative analysis of murine and human amyloid-beta1-40 and 1-42.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), has long been a focus of basic and translation research in AD. Quantification and dissociation of the Abeta fractions in their soluble and insoluble forms, is a key factor in numerous AD studies. NEW METHOD: Here we provide a generalized sandwich-enzyme-linked-immuno-sorbent-assay (sELISA) protocol for quantification of human and murine Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 and dissociation of these peptides to their soluble-oligomeric and insoluble-fibrillar forms. RESULTS: We have validated the levels of soluble and insoluble Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 in the 5XFAD AD and the Ts65Dn Down-Syndrome (DS) mouse models in both the cortex, hippocampus and blood as follows: (1) blood levels of Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 are elevated in both mouse strains. (2) 5XFAD mice exhibit elevated soluble and insoluble Abeta1-40 in cortical and hippocampal tissues, soluble Abeta1-42 in the hippocampus, and insoluble Abeta1-42in both cortical and hippocampal tissues (3) Ts65Dn mice exhibit elevated levels of Abeta1-40 in the cortex. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Several methodologies have been proposed for the high throughput measure of Abeta, including HPLC-mass-spectrometry, micro-immunoelectrodes, immunoprecipitation and ELISA. Although commercial sELISA kits are widely used, herein, we describe a more accessible and cost-effective in-house protocol enabling to measure either human or murine, soluble and insoluble Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 levels. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a streamlined and accessible protocol for the assessment of soluble and insoluble Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 levels from mouse or human origins, enabling a higher accessibility for researchers in the field to generate reliable Abeta-related measurements.",

Whether this reflects a causal association remains to be established. METHODS: Using a Mendelian randomization approach, we studied 106,562 and 75,260 individuals from the general population in observational and genetic analyses, respectively. RESULTS: In observational analyses risk of Alzheimer's disease and all dementia increased stepwise as a function of stepwise lower apoE levels (P for trend, 2 x 10-17 and 9 x 10-21). APOE-weighted allele scores were associated with stepwise decreases in apoE (P for trend, <1 x 10-300). In instrumental variable analysis, the causal risk ratios for a 1 mg/dL genetically determined lower apoE were 1.41 (1.27-1.57) for Alzheimer's disease and 1.33 (1.25-1.43) for all dementia (F-statistics = 3821). DISCUSSION: Genetic and hence lifelong low apoE is associated with high risk of dementia in the general population. The concordance between observational and genetic estimates suggests a potential causal relationship.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Expression of neuronal thread protein (NTP), which is considered to be related to neuritic sprouting and neuronal death, may be elevated in brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and even urine in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: In this study, we analyzed the correlation between urine AD-associated NTP (AD7c-NTP) level, and amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition, and clinical symptoms in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: Twenty-two patients with mild to moderate AD and 8 subjects with MCI were recruited. Abeta deposition was measured with [11C]-labeled Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-positron emission tomography (PET) in all participants. Urine AD7c-NTP levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) were used to evaluate cognitive function and behavioral psychological symptoms, respectively. RESULTS: Fourteen (63.6%) of AD patients and 2 (25.0%) of MCI subjects were Abeta positive on PiB-PET. There was a significant difference in urine AD7c-NTP level between Abeta positive (2.27+-2.22 ng/ml) and negative (0.55+-0.60 ng/ml) subjects (p = 0.018). Using 1.46 ng/ml as a cut-off value, 68.8% of Abeta positive subjects showed elevated urine AD7c-NTP level, and 92.9% of Abeta negative subjects showed normal urine AD7c-NTP level. There were no relationships between urine AD7c-NTP level and MMSE and total NPI scores. However, AD7c-NTP level positively correlated with agitation score on NPI. CONCLUSIONS: Urine AD7c-NTP had high specificity and moderate sensitivity in predicting Abeta deposition among patients with cognitive impairment. Furthermore, urine AD7c-NTP level strongly correlated with the symptom of agitation.",

A total of 205 nondiabetic CN older adults underwent comprehensive clinical assessment, [11C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-positron emission tomography (PET), [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, magnetic resonance imaging, and blood sampling for fasting insulin and HbA1c measurement. Lower blood insulin was significantly associated with increased Abeta positivity rates and decreased cerebral glucose metabolism in the AD-signature region. In contrast, higher HbA1c levels were not associated with Abeta positivity rates but were significantly associated with higher rates of having neurodegeneration in the AD-signature regions. Our results suggest different roles of insulin and HbA1c in AD pathogenesis, in that decreased blood insulin below optimal levels may contribute to increasing cerebral Abeta deposition and neurodegeneration whereas impaired glycemic control may aggravate neurodegeneration through a nonamyloid mechanism in nondiabetic CN older adults.",

However, the underlying mechanisms and disease relevance of such lysosome accumulations are not well understood. Motivated by these problems, we identified JNK-interacting protein 3 (JIP3) as an important regulator of axonal lysosome transport and maturation. JIP3 knockout mouse neuron primary cultures accumulate lysosomes within focal axonal swellings that resemble the dystrophic axons at amyloid plaques. These swellings contain high levels of amyloid precursor protein processing enzymes (BACE1 and presenilin 2) and are accompanied by elevated Abeta peptide levels. The in vivo importance of the JIP3-dependent regulation of axonal lysosomes was revealed by the worsening of the amyloid plaque pathology arising from JIP3 haploinsufficiency in a mouse model of AD. These results establish the critical role of JIP3-dependent axonal lysosome transport in regulating amyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein processing and support a model wherein Abeta production is amplified by plaque-induced axonal lysosome transport defects.",

In particular, cAMP was shown to favor hippocampal LTP by stimulating the synthesis of the amyloid precursor protein APP, whereas cGMP was found to enhance LTP and to improve memory by increasing Abeta levels without affecting the expression of APP.

    "abstract": "One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease is the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques that consist mainly of abnormally aggregated forms of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides. These peptides are generated by gamma-secretase-catalyzed cleavage of a dimeric membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (C99) of the amyloid precursor protein. Although C99 homodimerization has been linked to Abeta production and changes in the aggregation-determining Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio, the motif through which C99 dimerizes has remained controversial. Here, we have used two independent assays to gain insight into C99 homodimerization in the context of the membrane of live cells: bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and Tango membrane protein-protein interaction assays, which were further confirmed by traditional pull-down assays. Our results indicate a four-amino acid region within the C99 transmembrane helix (43TVIV46) as well as its local secondary structure as critical determinants for homodimerization. These four amino acids are also a hot spot of familial Alzheimer's disease-linked mutations that both decrease C99 homodimerization and gamma-secretase cleavage and alter the initial cleavage site to increase the Abeta42/40 ratio.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides is a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In spite of numerous attempts to prevent the beta-amyloidosis, no effective drugs for treating AD have been developed to date. Among many candidate chemicals, methylene blue (MB) has proved its therapeutic potential for AD in a number of in vitro and in vivo studies; but the result of recent clinical trials performed with MB and its derivative was negative. Here, with the aid of multiple photochemical analyses, we first report that photoexcited MB molecules can block Abeta42 aggregation in vitro. Furthermore, our in vivo study using Drosophila AD model demonstrates that photoexcited MB is highly effective in suppressing synaptic toxicity, resulting in a reduced damage to the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), an enhanced locomotion, and decreased vacuole in the brain. The hindrance effect is attributed to Abeta42 oxidation by singlet oxygen (1O2) generated from photoexcited MB. Finally, we show that photoexcited MB possess a capability to disaggregate the pre-existing Abeta42 aggregates and reduce Abeta-induced cytotoxicity. Our work suggests that light illumination can provide an opportunity to boost the efficacies of MB toward photodynamic therapy of AD in future.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is a common symptom associated with neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although evidence exists to suggest that peripheral olfactory organs are involved in the olfactory dysfunction that accompanies AD pathology, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. As confirmed using behavioral tests, transgenic mice overexpressing a Swedish mutant form of human amyloid precursor proteins exhibited olfactory impairments prior to evidence of cognitive impairment. By measuring the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, we observed that specific regions of the olfactory bulb (OB) in Tg2576 mice, specifically the ventral portion exhibited significant decreases in the number of dopaminergic neurons in the periglomerular regions from the early stage of AD. To confirm the direct linkage between these olfactory impairments and AD-related pathology, beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)-the initiating enzyme in Abeta genesis-and beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta), hallmarks of AD were analyzed. We found that an increase in BACE1 expression coincided with an elevation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers in the ventral region of OB. Moreover, olfactory epithelium (OE), in particular the ectoturbinate in which axons of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) have direct connections with the dendrites of mitral/tufted cells in the ventral part of OB, exhibited significant decreases in both thickness and cell number even at early stages. This result suggests that Abeta oligomer toxicity in the OE may have induced a decline in the number of OSNs and functional impairment of the olfactory system. We first demonstrated that disproportionate levels of regional damage in the peripheral olfactory system may be a specific symptom of AD with Abeta oligomer accumulation occurring prior to damage within the CNS. This regional damage in the olfactory system early in the progression of AD may be closely related to AD-related pathological abnormality and olfactory dysfunction found in AD patients.",

    "abstract": "Self-association of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and serves as a general prototype for amyloid formation. A key endogenous inhibitor of Abeta self-association is human serum albumin (HSA), which binds ~90% of plasma Abeta. However, the exact molecular mechanism by which HSA binds Abeta monomers and protofibrils is not fully understood. Here, using dark-state exchange saturation transfer NMR and relaxation experiments complemented by morphological characterization, we mapped the HSA-Abeta interactions at atomic resolution by examining the effects of HSA on Abeta monomers and soluble high-molecular weight oligomeric protofibrils. We found that HSA binds both monomeric and protofibrillar Abeta, but the affinity of HSA for Abeta monomers is lower than for Abeta protofibrils (Kd values are submillimolar rather than micromolar) yet physiologically relevant because of the ~0.6-0.7 mm plasma HSA concentration. In both Abeta protofibrils and monomers, HSA targets key Abeta self-recognition sites spanning the beta strands found in cross-beta protofibril structures, leading to a net switch from direct to tethered contacts between the monomeric Abeta and the protofibril surface. These HSA-Abeta interactions are isoform-specific, because the HSA affinity of Abeta monomers is lower for Abeta(1-42) than for Abeta(1-40). In addition, the HSA-induced perturbations of the monomer/protofibrils pseudo-equilibrium extend to the C-terminal residues in the Abeta(1-42) isoform but not in Abeta(1-40). These results provide an unprecedented view of how albumin interacts with Abeta and illustrate the potential of dark-state exchange saturation transfer NMR in mapping the interactions between amyloid-inhibitory proteins and amyloidogenic peptides.",

Imbalances in the activity of all three enzymes can result in alterations towards pathogenic Abeta production. Proteolysis of APP is strongly linked to its subcellular localization as the secretases involved are distributed in different cellular compartments. APP has been shown to dimerize in cis-orientation, affecting Abeta production. This might be explained by different substrate properties defined by the APP oligomerization state or alternatively by altered APP monomer/dimer localization. We investigated the latter hypothesis using two different APP dimerization systems in HeLa cells. Dimerization caused a decreased localization of APP to the Golgi and at the plasma membrane, whereas the levels in the ER and in endosomes were increased. Furthermore, we observed via live cell imaging and biochemical analyses that APP dimerization affects its interaction with LRP1 and SorLA, suggesting that APP dimerization modulates its interplay with sorting molecules and in turn its localization and processing. Thus, pharmacological approaches targeting APP oligomerization properties might open novel strategies for treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Verubecestat is a potent BACE1 enzyme inhibitor currently being investigated in Phase III trials for the treatment of mild-to-moderate and prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Multiple anti-amyloid immunotherapies have been dose-limited by adverse amyloid related imaging abnormalities such as vasogenic edema (ARIA-E) and microhemorrhage (ARIA-H) observed in human trials and mice. Verubecestat was tested in a 12-week nonclinical study for the potential to exacerbate microhemorrhage (ARIA-H) profiles in 18-22-month-old post-plaque Tg2576-AbetaPPswe mice. Animals were treated with verubecestat or controls including the anti-Abeta antibody analog of bapineuzumab (3D6) as a positive control for ARIA induction. ARIA-H was measured using in-life longitudinal T2*-MRI and Prussian blue histochemistry at study end. Verubecestat reduced plasma and cerebrospinal fluid Abeta40 and Abeta42 by >90% and 62% to 68%, respectively. The ARIA-H profile of verubecestat-treated mice was not significantly different than controls. Anti-Abeta treatment significantly increased ARIA-H detected by Prussian blue staining; however, anti-Abeta antibody treatment did not impact plaque status. Verubecestat treatment significantly suppressed the accumulation of total levels of brain Abeta40 and Abeta42 and Thioflavin S positive plaque load. Stereological analysis of cortex and hippocampus plaque load similarly revealed significantly reduced area of Abeta immunoreactivity and reduced plaque number in verubecestat-treated animals compared to controls. The absence of elevated ARIA events in verubecestat-treated mice was associated with a significant reduction in the level of accumulated CNS amyloid pathology and brain Abeta peptides; effects consistent with the desired therapeutic mechanism of verubecestat in AD patients.

    "abstract": "Targeting protein aggregation for the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases remains elusive for medicinal chemists, despite a number of small molecules known to interfere in amyloidogenesis, particularly of amyloid beta (Abeta) protein. Starting from previous findings in the antiaggregating activity of a class of indolin-2-ones inhibiting Abeta fibrillization, 5-methoxyisatin 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)hydrazone 1 was identified as a multitarget inhibitor of Abeta aggregation and cholinesterases with IC50s in the low muM range. With the aim of increasing aqueous solubility, a Mannich-base functionalization led to the synthesis of N-methylpiperazine derivative 2. At acidic pH, an outstanding solubility increase of 2 over the parent compound 1 was proved through a turbidimetric method. HPLC analysis revealed an improved stability of the Mannich base 2 at pH2 along with a rapid release of 1 in human serum as well as an outstanding hydrolytic stability of the parent hydrazone. Coincubation of Abeta1-42 with 2 resulted in the accumulation of low MW oligomers, as detected with PICUP assay. Cell assays on SH-SY5Y cells revealed that 2 exerts strong cytoprotective effects in both cell viability and radical quenching assays, mainly related to its active metabolite 1. These findings show that 2 drives the formation of non-toxic, off-pathway Abeta oligomers unable to trigger the amyloid cascade and toxicity.",

    "abstract": "beta-Amyloid peptide accumulation in the cortex and in the hippocampus results in neurodegeneration and memory loss. Recently, it became evident that the inflammatory response triggered by beta-Amyloid peptides promotes neuronal cell death and degeneration. In addition to inflammation, beta-Amyloid peptides also induce alterations in neuronal autophagy, eventually leading to neuronal cell death. Thus, here we evaluated whether the inflammatory response induced by the beta-Amyloid peptides impairs memory via disrupting the autophagic flux. We show that male mice overexpressing beta-Amyloid peptides (5XFAD) but lacking caspase-1, presented reduced beta-Amyloid plaques in the cortex and in the hippocampus; restored brain autophagic flux and improved learning and memory capacity. At the molecular level, inhibition of the inflammatory response in the 5XFAD mice restored LC3-II levels and prevented the accumulation of oligomeric p62 and ubiquitylated proteins. Furthermore, caspase-1 deficiency reinstates activation of the AMPK/Raptor pathway while down-regulating AKT/mTOR pathway. Consistent with this, we found an inverse correlation between the increase of autophagolysosomes in the cortex of 5XFAD mice lacking caspase-1 and the presence of mitochondria with altered morphology. Together our results indicate that beta-Amyloid peptide-induced caspase-1 activation, disrupts autophagy in the cortex and in the hippocampus resulting in neurodegeneration and memory loss.",

    "title": "A Becn1 mutation mediates hyperactive autophagic sequestration of amyloid oligomers and improved cognition in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Impairment of the autophagy pathway has been observed during the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal deposition of extracellular and intracellular amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides. Yet the role of autophagy in Abeta production and AD progression is complex. To study whether increased basal autophagy plays a beneficial role in Abeta clearance and cognitive improvement, we developed a novel genetic model to hyperactivate autophagy in vivo. We found that knock-in of a point mutation F121A in the essential autophagy gene Beclin 1/Becn1 in mice significantly reduces the interaction of BECN1 with its inhibitor BCL2, and thus leads to constitutively active autophagy even under non-autophagy-inducing conditions in multiple tissues, including brain. Becn1F121A-mediated autophagy hyperactivation significantly decreases amyloid accumulation, prevents cognitive decline, and restores survival in AD mouse models. Using an immunoisolation method, we found biochemically that Abeta oligomers are autophagic substrates and sequestered inside autophagosomes in the brain of autophagy-hyperactive AD mice. In addition to genetic activation of autophagy by Becn1 gain-of-function, we also found that ML246, a small-molecule autophagy inducer, as well as voluntary exercise, a physiological autophagy inducer, exert similar Becn1-dependent protective effects on Abeta removal and memory in AD mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that genetically disrupting BECN1-BCL2 binding hyperactivates autophagy in vivo, which sequestrates amyloid oligomers and prevents AD progression. The study establishes new approaches to activate autophagy in the brain, and reveals the important function of Becn1-mediated autophagy hyperactivation in the prevention of AD.",

Abeta42, t-tau, and p-tau have been reported in numerous studies to contribute to predicting cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PDCI). However, no consistent conclusion can be drawn so far. Literatures regarding Abeta42, t-tau, and p-tau in CSF were systematically reviewed, and a meta-analysis was thus performed to evaluate the changes of these biomarkers in PDCI patients, including PD with mild cognitive impairment (PDMCI) and PD dementia (PDD) patients, relative to PD with normal cognition (PDNC) patients. Databases of \"PubMed,\" \"EBSCO,\" and \"Springer\" were retrieved for articles concerning Abeta42, t-tau, and p-tau in PDCI patients relative to those in PDNC patients published from January 1, 2000 to February 1, 2017. The following keywords were set, namely, \"dementia\" or \"cognitive impairment\" or \"mild cognitive impairment\" and \"cerebrospinal fluid\" and \"Parkinson*.\" Sixteen articles comprising 590 PDCI patients and 1182 PDNC patients were included. The results showed that CSF Abeta42 level in PDCI cohort was lower than that in PDNC cohort (pooled Std.MD = -0.44, 95% CI [-0.61, -0.26], p < 0.00001). Reduced Abeta42 (pooled Std.MD = -0.60, 95% CI [-0.75, -0.45], p < 0.00001) as well as elevated t-tau (pooled Std.MD = 0.21, 95% CI [0.06, 0.35], p = 0.006) and p-tau (pooled Std.MD = 0.36, 95% CI [0.02, 0.69], p = 0.04) could be observed in PDD cohort compared with PDNC cohort.

In this study we treated with a synthetic beta amyloid peptide murine microglial cells metabolically differently labelled with stable isotope amino acids (SILAC). The plasma membrane was selectively enriched by a multi-stage aqueous two-phase partition system. We were able to identify by 1D-LC-MS/MS analyses 1577 proteins, most of them are plasma membrane proteins according to the Gene Ontology annotation. An unchanged level of amyloid receptors in this data set suggests that microglia preserve their responsiveness capability to the environment even after 24-h challenge with amyloid peptides. On the other hand, 14 proteins were observed to change their plasma membrane abundance to a statistically significant extent. Among these, we proposed as reliable biomarkers of the inflammatory microglia phenotype in AD damaged tissues MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 3 (MARK3), Interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), Annexins A5 and A7 (ANXA5, ANXA7) and Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), all proteins known to be involved in the inflammation processes and in microtubule network assembly rate.",

We measured CD14, CD62P, and CD42a using fluorescence-activated cell scanning (FACS) analysis. Our data show that the levels of circulating monocyte-platelet aggregates were not different between healthy controls and AD patients. However, incubation with beta-amyloid-40, -42, and pyroglutamate-beta-amyloid increased the platelet-monocyte aggregation in healthy subjects, but not AD patients. Our data conclude that the interaction between monocytes and platelets is not altered in whole blood of AD patients, but their sensitivity toward beta-amyloid peptides is decreased.

    "abstract": "The specific amyloid-beta (Abeta) species or other amyloid-precursor protein cleavage products that are most directly related to human neurodegeneration and clinical dementia of the Alzheimer's type have not yet been directly identified. Without a clear understanding of the most relevant species, it is difficult to determine whether therapeutic candidates successfully engaged the correct target(s). Here, we review some of the controversies regarding soluble Abeta aggregates (also termed oligomers, dimers, trimers, Abeta*56, amylospheroids, etc.) and propose experiments designed to move forward towards new therapeutic approaches. Specifically, we review the increasing evidence for the relevance of non-canonical forms of Abeta, the much more potent toxicity attributable to native species than to synthetic Abeta, and the evidence implicating the ratio of soluble Abeta aggregates to plaques in differentiating demented patients from non-demented high Abeta plaque pathology controls. To move forward, we propose four related directions. 1) Narrowing the focus to species derived from human Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue, as opposed to synthetic Abeta, cell culture-derived species, or species primarily present in animal models. 2) Careful study of differences between patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type vs. non-demented controls with high Abeta plaque pathology. This will involve testing the hypothesis that, under some circumstances, plaques may buffer soluble toxic species, but later release them into the surrounding milieu. 3) Investigations of other protein constituents of soluble Abeta aggregates in addition to Abeta itself. Our initial data based on chemical cleavage experiments indicate that other proteins do appear to be part of the human brain soluble Abeta aggregates. 4) Multimodal experimental assessments of toxicity, including longer term effects on synapse loss, related deleterious cellular responses, and degeneration in human-derived neuron-like cells. Overall, the goal is to identify specific Abeta species, other amyloid precursor protein cleavage products, or other key proteins in aggregates present in human AD brains, less abundant in non-demented high pathology control brains, and robustly toxic in a wide variety of relevant assays. These species themselves, the enzymatic or cellular processes involved in their production, and their routes of clearance would be highly relevant therapeutic targets for dementia of the Alzheimer's type.",

    "abstract": "The protein Tau aggregates into tangles in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease. In solution, however, Tau is intrinsically disordered, highly soluble, and binds to microtubules. It is still unclear what initiates the conversion from an innocuous phase of high solubility and functionality to solid-like neurotoxic deposits. Here, we show that the microtubule-binding repeats of Tau, which are lysine-rich, undergo liquid-liquid phase separation in solution. Liquid-liquid demixing causes molecular crowding of amyloid-promoting elements of Tau and drives electrostatic coacervation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that three-repeat and four-repeat isoforms of Tau differ in their ability for demixing. Alternative splicing of Tau can thus regulate the formation of Tau-containing membrane-less compartments. In addition, phosphorylation of Tau repeats promotes liquid-liquid phase separation at cellular protein conditions. The combined data propose a mechanism in which liquid droplets formed by the positively charged microtubule-binding domain of Tau undergo coacervation with negatively charged molecules to promote amyloid formation.Tau forms aggregates in the brains of Alzheimer patients. Here, the authors identify conditions, where the microtubule-binding repeats of Tau undergo a phosphorylation-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation, leading to molecular crowding in the formed Tau liquid droplets and characterize them by NMR and other biophysical methods.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid formation of natively folded proteins involves global and/or local unfolding of the native state to form aggregation-prone intermediates. Here we report solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structural studies of amyloid derived from wild-type (WT) and more aggressive mutant forms of transthyretin (TTR) to investigate the structural changes associated with effective TTR aggregation. We employed selective 13C labeling schemes to investigate structural features of beta-structured core regions in amyloid states of WT and two mutant forms (V30M and L55P) of TTR. Analyses of the 13C-13C correlation solid-state NMR spectra revealed that WT TTR aggregates contain an amyloid core consisting of nativelike CBEF and DAGH beta-sheet structures, and the mutant TTR amyloids adopt a similar amyloid core structure with nativelike CBEF and AGH beta-structures. However, the V30M mutant amyloid was shown to have a different DA beta-structure. In addition, strand D is more disordered even in the native state of L55P TTR, indicating that the pathogenic mutations affect the DA beta-structure, leading to more effective amyloid formation. The NMR results are consistent with our mass spectrometry-based thermodynamic analyses that showed the amyloidogenic precursor states of WT and mutant TTRs adopt folded structures but the mutant precursor states are less stable than that of WT TTR. Analyses of the oxidation rate of the methionine side chain also revealed that the side chain of residue Met-30 pointing between strands D and A is not protected from oxidation in the V30M mutant, while protected in the native state, supporting the possibility that the DA beta-structure might be disrupted in the V30M mutant amyloid.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) is the major component of senile plaques (SP) in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and serves as an inflammatory stimulus for microglia. Trans-caryophyllene (TC), a major component in the essential oils derived from various species of medicinal plants, has displayed its neuro-protective effects in previous studies. However, whether TC has a protective role in AD remains unknown. In this study, the effects of TC on Abeta1-42-induced neuro-inflammation were investigated. We found that TC reduced the release of LDH in BV-2 microglial cells treated with Abeta1-42. In addition, pretreatment of BV2 microglia with TC at concentrations of 10, 25, and 50muM prior to Abeta stimulation led to significant inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Notably, our results indicate that TC remarkably attenuated Abeta1-42-activated overexpression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). We further demonstrated that TC markedly reversed Abeta1-42-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha, nuclear translocation of p65, and NF-kappaB transcriptional activity. These findings suggest that TC may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory deficits and cognitive decline. Excessive amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide aggregates and forms soluble oligomers and insoluble cerebral amyloid plaques, which is widely thought to be the underlying pathogenic mechanism of AD. Therefore, effective regulation of Abeta metabolism is an important aspect of preventing and improving AD. Berberine, which is the main active component of the traditional medicinal herb Coptidis rhizoma, has a positive effect on reducing Abeta levels. However, the exact mechanism involved is unclear and requires more investigation. In the present study, we examined the role of berberine in the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in neuroblastoma cells and primary cultured neurons and sought to characterize the role of AMPK in the metabolism of Abeta. The results indicate that berberine reduces Abeta generation and decreases the expression of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) via activating AMPK in N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells stably expressing human Swedish mutant APP695 (N2a/APP695sw), N2a cells, and primary cultured cortical neurons. Therefore, berberine reduced the accumulation of Abeta, which likely contributes to its memory enhancing effect in patients with AD.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation comprises a major characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including AD, and has been proposed as a potent therapeutic target for AD. Although a number of studies focusing on pharmacological or genetic manipulation of TNF-alpha and its receptors in AD mice have provided significant knowledge regarding the role of TNF-alpha signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of AD, the consequences of TNF-alpha genetic deletion have not been thoroughly examined. Here, we focused on the effect of TNF-alpha deficiency on the amyloid phenotype of 5XFAD mice. Our analysis revealed that amyloid deposition, amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels, and AbetaPP-carboxyterminal fragments are significantly reduced in the brains of 5XFAD/TNF-alpha-/- mice compared to the 5XFAD/TNF-alpha+/+. We found decreased protein levels of beta- and alpha-secretases in the 5XFAD/TNF-alpha-/- brains, suggesting for an effect of TNF-alpha on AbetaPP processing and Abeta generation. We also show for the first time that TNF-alpha affects PS1in vivo, as 5XFAD mice lacking TNF-alpha expression display reduced PS1-carboxyterminal fragments implying for diminished PS1 activity. Moreover, TNF-alpha deficiency decreases microglial and astrocytic activation and significantly restricts the phagocytic activity of macrophages against Abeta, supporting for reduced responsiveness of phagocytes toward Abeta. Overall, our results reveal that TNF-alpha genetic deletion in 5XFAD mice attenuates amyloid plaque formation by lowering Abeta generation through the reduction of functionally active PS1 and beta-secretase rather than promoting Abeta clearance by phagocytic cells. Our data further suggest TNF-alpha inhibition as a therapeutic approach for AD.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and larger microvesicles, have been implicated to play a role in several conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since the EV content mirrors the intracellular environment, it could contribute with important information about ongoing pathological processes and may be a useful source for biomarkers, reflecting the disease progression. The aim of the present study was to analyze the protein content of EVs specifically released from a mixed co-culture of primary astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes treated with synthetic amyloid-beta (Abeta42) protofibrils. The EV isolation was performed by ultracentrifugation and validated by transmission electron microscopy. Mass spectrometry analysis of the EV content revealed a total of 807 unique proteins, of which five displayed altered levels in Abeta42 protofibril exposed cultures. The most prominent protein was apolipoprotein E (apoE), and by western blot analysis we could confirm a threefold increase of apoE in EVs from Abeta42 protofibril exposed cells, compared to unexposed cells. Moreover, immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that apoE was primarily situated inside the EVs, whereas immunocytochemistry indicated that the EVs most likely derived from the astrocytes and the neurons in the culture. The identified Abeta-induced sorting of apoE into EVs from cultured neuroglial cells suggests a possible role for intercellular transfer of apoE in AD pathology and encourage future studies to fully elucidate the clinical relevance of this event.",

    "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly recognized that cerebrovascular disease is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A unique 4D-Flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, phase contrast vastly undersampled isotropic projection imaging (PC VIPR), enables examination of angiographic and quantitative metrics of blood flow in the arteries of the Circle of Willis within a single MRI acquisition. Thirty-eight participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) underwent a comprehensive neuroimaging protocol (including 4D-Flow imaging) and a standard neuropsychological battery. A subset of participants (n = 22) also underwent lumbar puncture and had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assayed for AD biomarkers. Cut-offs for biomarker positivity in CSF resulting from a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of AD cases and controls from the larger Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center cohort were used to classify MCI participants as biomarker positive or negative on amyloid-beta (Abeta42), total-tau and total-tau/Abeta42 ratio. Internal carotid artery (ICA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) mean flow were associated with executive functioning performance, with lower mean flow corresponding to worse performance. MCI participants who were biomarker positive for Abeta42 had lower ICA mean flow than did those who were Abeta42 negative. In sum, mean ICA and MCA arterial flow was associated with cognitive performance in participants with MCI and lower flow in the ICA was associated with amyloid positivity. This provides further evidence for vascular health as a contributing factor in the etiopathogenesis of AD, and could represent a point to intervene in the disease process.",

The IME sensing device was fabricated using a surface micromachining process. For highly sensitive detection of several tens to hundreds of picogram/mL of Abeta in blood, medium change from plasma to PBS buffer was utilized with signal cancellation and amplification processing (SCAP) system. The system demonstrated approximately 100-folds higher sensitivity according to the concentrations. A robust antibody-immobilization process was used for stability during medium change. Selectivity of the reaction due to the affinity of Abeta to the antibody and the sensitivity according to the concentration of Abeta were also demonstrated. Considering these basic characteristics of the IME sensor system, the medium change was optimized in relation to the absolute value of impedance change and differentiated impedance changes for real plasma based Abeta detection. Finally, the detection of Abeta levels in transgenic and wild-type mouse plasma samples was accomplished with the designed sensor system and the medium-changing method. The results confirmed the potential of this system to discriminate between patients and healthy controls, which would enable blood-based AD diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: beta-Amyloid (Abeta) peptide is believed to play a pivotal role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Passive immunization with anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies may facilitate the clearance of Abeta in the brain and may thus prevent the downstream pathology. Antibodies targeting the immunodominant N-terminal epitope of Abeta and capable of binding both the plaques and soluble species have been most efficacious in animal models. Structural studies of such antibodies with bound Abeta peptides provided the basis for understanding the mechanisms of action and the differences in potency. To gain further insight into the structural determinants of antigen recognition and the preferential Abeta conformations, we determined the crystal structure of murine antibody C706 in complex with the N-terminal Abeta 1-16 peptide sequence. METHODS: The antigen-binding fragment of C706 was expressed in HEK293 cells and was crystallized in complex with the Abeta peptide. The X-ray structure was determined at 1.9-A resolution. RESULTS: The binding epitope of C706 is centered on residues Arg5 and His6, which provide the majority of interactions. Unlike most antibodies, C706 recognizes a coiled rather than extended conformation of Abeta. CONCLUSIONS: Comparison with other antibodies targeting the N-terminal section of Abeta suggests that the conformation of the bound peptide may be linked to the immunization protocol and may reflect the preference for the extended conformation in the context of a longer Abeta peptide as opposed to the coiled conformation in the isolated short peptide.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the usefulness of dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging to identify idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (IRBD) patients at risk for short-term development of clinically defined synucleinopathy. METHODS: Eighty-seven patients with polysomnography-confirmed IRBD underwent 123 I-FP-CIT DAT-SPECT. Results were compared to 20 matched controls without RBD who underwent DAT-SPECT. In patients, FP-CIT uptake was considered abnormal when values were two standard deviations below controls' mean uptake. After DAT-SPECT, patients were followed up during 5.7 +- 2.2 (range, 2.6-9.9) years. RESULTS: Baseline DAT deficit was found in 51 (58.6%) patients. During follow-up, 25 (28.7%) subjects developed clinically defined synucleinopathy (Parkinson's disease in 11, dementia with Lewy bodies in 13, and multiple system atrophy in 1) with mean latency of 3.2 +- 1.9 years from imaging. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed increased risk of incident synucleinopathy in patients with abnormal DAT-SPECT than with normal DAT-SPECT (20% vs 6% at 3 years, 33% vs 18% at 5 years; log rank test, p = 0.006). Receiver operating characteristics curve revealed that reduction of FP-CIT uptake in putamen greater than 25% discriminated patients with DAT deficit who developed synucleinopathy from patients with DAT deficit that remained disease free after 3 years of follow-up. At 5-year follow-up, DAT-SPECT had 75% sensitivity, 51% specificity, 44% positive predictive value, 80% negative predictive value, and likelihood ratio 1.54 to predict synucleinopathy. INTERPRETATION: DAT-SPECT identifies IRBD patients at short-term risk for synucleinopathy. Decreased FP-CIT putamen uptake greater than 25% predicts synucleinopathy after 3 years' follow-up. These observations may be useful to select candidates for disease modification trials in IRBD. Ann Neurol 2017;82:419-428.",

    "abstract": "The structural underpinnings for the higher toxicity of the oligomeric intermediates of amyloidogenic peptides, compared to the mature fibrils, remain unknown at present. The transient nature and heterogeneity of the oligomers make it difficult to follow their structure. Here, using vibrational and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that freely aggregating Abeta40 oligomers in physiological solutions have an intramolecular antiparallel configuration that is distinct from the intermolecular parallel beta-sheet structure observed in mature fibrils. The intramolecular hydrogen-bonding network flips nearly 90 , and the two beta-strands of each monomeric unit move apart, to give rise to the well-known intermolecular in-register parallel beta-sheet structure in the mature fibrils. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance distance measurements capture the interstrand separation within monomer units during the transition from the oligomer to the fibril form. We further find that the D23-K28 salt-bridge, a major feature of the Abeta40 fibrils and a focal point of mutations linked to early onset Alzheimer's disease, is not detectable in the small oligomers. Molecular dynamics simulations capture the correlation between changes in the D23-K28 distance and the flipping of the monomer secondary structure between antiparallel and parallel beta-sheet architectures. Overall, we propose interstrand separation and salt-bridge formation as key reaction coordinates describing the structural transition of the small Abeta40 oligomers to fibrils.",

    "abstract": "(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) effectively reduces the cytotoxicity of the Alzheimer's disease beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) by remodeling seeding-competent Abeta oligomers into off-pathway seeding-incompetent Abeta assemblies. However, the mechanism of EGCG-induced remodeling is not fully understood. Here we combine 15N and 1H dark-state exchange saturation transfer (DEST), relaxation, and chemical shift projection NMR analyses with fluorescence, dynamic light scattering, and electron microscopy to elucidate how EGCG remodels Abeta oligomers. We show that the remodeling adheres to a Hill-Scatchard model whereby the Abeta(1-40) self-association occurs cooperatively and generates Abeta(1-40) oligomers with multiple independent binding sites for EGCG with a Kd ~10-fold lower than that for the Abeta(1-40) monomers. Upon binding to EGCG, the Abeta(1-40) oligomers become less solvent exposed, and the beta-regions, which are involved in direct monomer-protofibril contacts in the absence of EGCG, undergo a direct-to-tethered contact shift. This switch toward less engaged monomer-protofibril contacts explains the seeding incompetency observed upon EGCG remodeling and suggests that EGCG interferes with secondary nucleation events known to generate toxic Abeta assemblies. Unexpectedly, the N-terminal residues experience an opposite EGCG-induced shift from tethered to direct contacts, explaining why EGCG remodeling occurs without release of Abeta(1-40) monomers. We also show that upon binding Abeta(1-40) oligomers the relative positions of the EGCG B and D rings change with respect to that of ring A. These distinct structural changes occurring in both Abeta(1-40) oligomers and EGCG during remodeling offer a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanism of EGCG as a neurotoxicity inhibitor. Furthermore, the results reported here illustrate the effectiveness of DEST-based NMR approaches in investigating the mechanism of low-molecular-weight amyloid inhibitors.",

Moreover, constitutive deletion of the Abetao-binding cellular prion protein (PrPC) prevents development of memory deficits in APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice, a model of familial AD. Here, we define the role of PrPC to rescue or halt established AD endophenotypes in a therapeutic disease-modifying time window after symptom onset. Deletion of Prnp at either 12 or 16 months of age fully reverses hippocampal synapse loss and completely rescues preexisting behavioral deficits by 17 months. In contrast, but consistent with a neuronal function for Abetao/PrPC signaling, plaque density, microgliosis, and astrocytosis are not altered. Degeneration of catecholaminergic neurons remains unchanged by PrPC reduction after disease onset. These results define the potential of targeting PrPC as a disease-modifying therapy for certain AD-related phenotypes after disease onset.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The study presented here further elucidates our understanding of the soluble oligomeric amyloid-beta-Abetao-binding cellular prion protein (PrPC) signaling pathway in a familial form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by implicating PrPC as a potential therapeutic target for AD.

    "abstract": "Oligomeric forms of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide are thought to represent the primary synaptotoxic species underlying the neurodegenerative changes seen in Alzheimer's disease. It has been proposed that the cellular prion protein (PrPC) functions as a cell-surface receptor, which binds to Abeta oligomers and transduces their toxic effects. However, the molecular details of the PrPC-Abeta interaction remain uncertain. Here, we investigated the effect of PrPC on polymerization of Abeta under rigorously controlled conditions in which Abeta converts from a monomeric to a fibrillar state via a series of kinetically defined steps. We demonstrated that PrPC specifically inhibited elongation of Abeta fibrils, most likely by binding to the ends of growing fibrils. Surprisingly, this inhibitory effect required the globular C-terminal domain of PrPC, which has not been previously implicated in interactions with Abeta. Our results suggest that PrPC recognizes structural features common to both Abeta oligomers and fibril ends and that this interaction could contribute to the neurotoxic effect of Abeta aggregates. Additionally, our results identify the C terminus of PrPC as a new and potentially more druggable molecular target for treating Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but little is known about the proteoforms present in AD brain. We used high-resolution mass spectrometry to analyze intact Abeta from soluble aggregates and insoluble material in brains of six cases with severe dementia and pathologically confirmed AD. The soluble aggregates are especially relevant because they are believed to be the most toxic form of Abeta. We found a diversity of Abeta peptides, with 26 unique proteoforms including various N- and C-terminal truncations. N- and C-terminal truncations comprised 73% and 30%, respectively, of the total Abeta proteoforms detected. The Abeta proteoforms segregated between the soluble and more insoluble aggregates with N-terminal truncations predominating in the insoluble material and C- terminal truncations segregating into the soluble aggregates. In contrast, canonical Abeta comprised the minority of the identified proteoforms (15.3%) and did not distinguish between the soluble and more insoluble aggregates. The relative abundance of many truncated Abeta proteoforms did not correlate with post-mortem interval, suggesting they are not artefacts. This heterogeneity of Abeta proteoforms deepens our understanding of AD and offers many new avenues for investigation into pathological mechanisms of the disease, with implications for therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) production and clearance in the brain is a crucial focus of investigations into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Imbalance between production and clearance leads to accumulation of Abeta. The important Abeta-degrading enzymes in the brain are neprilysin (NEP) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), and defective enzyme expression may facilitate Abeta deposition in sporadic late-onset AD patients. It has been suggested that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a member of the catechin family, might be an effective treatment for AD, because it has been shown to elevate NEP expression. Therefore, we examined whether catechins, which are functional components of common foods, could regulate the degradation of Abeta by inducing NEP and IDE expression. We also investigated the role of catechins in activating intracellular signal transduction in astrocytes. Treatment of cultured rat astrocytes with EGCG significantly reduced the expression of NEP, but not IDE, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. NEP expression in cultured astrocytes was suppressed by activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and reduced NEP expression was accompanied by an increase of NEP release into the extracellular space (culture medium). Moreover, culture medium from EGCG-treated astrocytes facilitated the degradation of exogenous Abeta. These results suggest that EGCG may have a beneficial effect on AD by activating ERK-and PI3K-mediated pathways in astrocytes, thus increasing astrocyte secretion of NEP and facilitating degradation of Abeta.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia and a major health issue worldwide. The complexity of the pathology continues to challenge its comprehension and the implementation of effective treatments. In the last decade, a number of possible targets of intervention have been pointed out, among which the stimulation of 5-HT4 receptors (5-HT4Rs) seems very promising. 5-HT4R agonists exert pro-cognitive effects, inhibit amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) production and therefore directly and positively impact AD progression. In the present work, we investigated the effects of RS 67333, a partial 5-HT4R agonist, after chronic administration in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. 5xFAD male mice and their wild type (WT) male littermates received either RS 67333 or vehicle solution i.p., twice a week, for 2 or 4 months. Cognitive performance was evaluated in a hippocampal-dependent behavioral task, the olfactory tubing maze (OTM). Mice were then sacrificed to evaluate the metabolism of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), amyloidosis and neuroinflammatory processes. No beneficial effects of RS 67333 were observed in 5xFAD mice after 2 months of treatment, while 5xFAD mice treated for 4 months showed better cognitive abilities compared to vehicle-treated 5xFAD mice. The beneficial effects of RS 67333 on learning and memory correlated with the decrease in both amyloid plaque load and neuroinflammation, more specifically in the entorhinal cortex. The most significant improvements in learning and memory and reduction of pathology stigmata were observed after the 4-month administration of RS 67333, demonstrating that treatment duration is important to alleviate amyloidosis and glial reactivity, particularly in the entorhinal cortex. These results confirm the 5-HT4R as a promising target for AD pathogenesis and highlight the need for further investigations to characterize fully the underlying mechanisms of action.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent disorder of senile dementia mainly characterized by amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposits in the brain. Cannabinoids are relevant to AD as they exert several beneficial effects in many models of this disease. Still, whether the endocannabinoid system is either up- or down-regulated in AD has not yet been fully elucidated. Thus, the aim of the present paper was to analyze endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) metabolism in cerebral cortex synaptosomes incubated with Abeta oligomers or fibrils. These Abeta conformations were obtained by \"aging\" the 1-40 fragment of the peptide under different agitation and time conditions. A diminished availability of 2-AG resulting from a significant decrease in diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) activity was observed in the presence of large Abeta1-40 oligomers along with synaptosomal membrane damage, as judged by transmission electron microscopy and LDH release. Conversely, a high availability of 2-AG resulting from an increase in DAGL and lysophosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase activities occurred in the presence of Abeta1-40 fibrils although synaptosomal membrane disruption was also observed. Interestingly, neither synaptosomal mitochondrial viability assayed by MTT reduction nor membrane lipid peroxidation assayed by TBARS formation measurements were altered by Abeta1-40 oligomers or fibrils. These results show a differential effect of Abeta1-40 peptide on 2-AG metabolism depending on its conformation.",

    "abstract": "Chronic stress is considered a widely accepted risk factor for the development of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Indeed, high cortisol levels, and, thus, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA)-axis dysregulation, have been indicated as the most frequent alteration in patients affected by depression, as well as by Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, depressive state has been pointed as an early manifestation of AD, advocating an overlap between these neuropathological events. We have previously demonstrated that central soluble beta amyloid 1-42 (Abeta) administration peptide induces a depressive like-behavior in rats, with altered HPA axis activation, reduced cortical serotonin and neurotrophin levels. The crucial role of Abeta in stress response is becoming more and more evident, indeed many reports indicate that its release is increased in stressful conditions and stress-based paradigm. Furthermore, it has been reported that stress controls Abeta production and/or clearance. Chronic stress is responsible of inducing neuroinflammation processes and reduced serotoninergic tone, both pathophysiological mechanisms proposed in the association of depression with another chronic disease, such as diabetes. Likewise, AD has also been indicated as type 3 diabetes, considering the large body of literature that suggests common biological bases. Thus, the main aim of the present review is to evaluate the most recent literature findings in humans and animal models in regard to the role of Abeta in stress response and in relation to the biological substrates and pathological pathways common to AD and comorbid diseases, such as depression and diabetes.",

    "title": "Role of membrane GM1 on early neuronal membrane actions of Abeta during onset of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "The ability of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) to disrupt the plasma membrane through formation of pores and membrane breakage has been previously described. However, the molecular determinants for these effects are largely unknown. In this study, we examined if the association and subsequent membrane perforation induced by Abeta was dependent on GM1 levels. Pretreatment of hippocampal neurons with D-PDMP decreased GM1 and Abeta clustering at the membrane (Abeta fluorescent-punctas/20mum, control=16.2+-1.1 vs. D-PDMP=6.4+-0.4, p<0.001). Interestingly, membrane perforation with Abeta occurred with a slower time course when the GM1 content was diminished (time to establish perforated configuration (TEPC) (min): control=7.8+-2 vs. low GM1=12.1+-0.5, p<0.01), suggesting that the presence of GM1 in the membrane can modulate the distribution and the membrane perforation by Abeta. On the other hand, increasing GM1 facilitated the membrane perforation (TEPC: control=7.8+-2 vs. GM1=6.2+-1min, p<0.05). Additionally, using Cholera Toxin Subunit-B (CTB) to block the interaction of Abeta with GM1 attenuated membrane perforation significantly. Furthermore, pretreatment with CTB decreased the membrane association of Abeta (fluorescent-punctas/20mum, Abeta: control=14.8+-2.5 vs. CTB=8+-1.4, p<0.05), suggesting that GM1 also plays a role in both association of Abeta with the membrane and in perforation. In addition, blockade of the Abeta association with CTB inhibited synaptotoxicity. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that membrane lipid composition can affect the ability of Abeta to associate and subsequently perforate the plasma membrane thereby modulating its neurotoxicity in hippocampal neurons.",

This finding supports the clinical utility of amyloid imaging in diagnostic process of early-onset AD. Moreover, striatal dominant uptake pattern demonstrated in this patient include some meaningful clinical implications that warrant special attention among clinicians.",

    "abstract": "To clarify the role of microglia in brain homeostasis and disease, an understanding of their maintenance, proliferation and turnover is essential. The lifespan of brain microglia, however, remains uncertain, and reflects confounding factors in earlier assessments that were largely indirect. We genetically labeled single resident microglia in living mice and then used multiphoton microscopy to monitor these cells over time. Under homeostatic conditions, we found that neocortical resident microglia were long-lived, with a median lifetime of well over 15 months; thus, approximately half of these cells survive the entire mouse lifespan. While proliferation of resident neocortical microglia under homeostatic conditions was low, microglial proliferation in a mouse model of Alzheimer's beta-amyloidosis was increased threefold. The persistence of individual microglia throughout the mouse lifespan provides an explanation for how microglial priming early in life can induce lasting functional changes and how microglial senescence may contribute to age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "We have shown previously that Nano-PSO, a nanodroplet formulation of pomegranate seed oil, delayed progression of neurodegeneration signs when administered for a designated period of time to TgMHu2ME199K mice, modeling for genetic prion disease. In the present work, we treated these mice with a self-emulsion formulation of Nano-PSO or a parallel Soybean oil formulation from their day of birth until a terminal disease stage. We found that long term Nano-PSO administration resulted in increased survival of TgMHu2ME199K lines by several months. Interestingly, initiation of treatment at day 1 had no clinical advantage over initiation at day 70, however cessation of treatment at 9months of age resulted in the rapid loss of the beneficial clinical effect. Pathological studies revealed that treatment with Nano-PSO resulted in the reduction of GAG accumulation and lipid oxidation, indicating a strong neuroprotective effect. Contrarily, the clinical effect of Nano-PSO did not correlate with reduction in the levels of disease related PrP, the main prion marker. We conclude that long term administration of Nano-PSO is safe and may be effective in the prevention/delay of onset of neurodegenerative conditions such as genetic CJD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence indicates that amyloid beta oligomer (AbetaO) is toxic to neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of honokiol on AbetaO-induced learning and memory dysfunction in mice. METHODS: AD mice model was established by AbetaO intrahippocampal injection. The cognitive function was evaluated using Morris water maze (MWM). Nissl staining was used to examine the hippocampal neuron damage. Primary hippocampal neurons were exposed to AbetaO. The apoptosis in the hippocampal tissues and primary neurons was assessed using terminal dexynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling-neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and Hoechst staining, respectively. The mitochondrial membrane potential and radical oxygen species were detected using standard methods. Western blotting assay was used to check the expression levels of apoptotic and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) signaling-associated proteins and electrophoretic mobility shift assay was used to detect NF-kappaB-DNA binding. RESULTS: Honokiol increased the time spend in the target zone of the AD mice in the MWM. In addition, honokiol dose-dependently attenuated AbetaO-induced hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, reactive oxygen species production and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, AbetaO-induced NF-kappaB activation was inhibited by honokiol, as well as the upregulated amyloid precursor protein and beta-secretase. CONCLUSION: Honokiol attenuates AbetaO-induced learning and memory dysfunction in mice and it may be a potential candidate in AD therapy.",

    "title": "Dietary arachidonic acid increases deleterious effects of amyloid-beta oligomers on learning abilities and expression of AMPA receptors: putative role of the ACSL4-cPLA2 balance.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polyunsaturated fatty acids play a crucial role in neuronal function, and the modification of these compounds in the brain could have an impact on neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Despite the fact that arachidonic acid is the second foremost polyunsaturated fatty acid besides docosahexaenoic acid, its role and the regulation of its transfer and mobilization in the brain are poorly known. METHODS: Two groups of 39 adult male BALB/c mice were fed with an arachidonic acid-enriched diet or an oleic acid-enriched diet, respectively, for 12 weeks. After 10 weeks on the diet, mice received intracerebroventricular injections of either NaCl solution or amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) oligomers. Y-maze and Morris water maze tests were used to evaluate short- and long-term memory. At 12 weeks on the diet, mice were killed, and blood, liver, and brain samples were collected for lipid and protein analyses. RESULTS: We found that the administration of an arachidonic acid-enriched diet for 12 weeks induced short-term memory impairment and increased deleterious effects of Abeta oligomers on learning abilities. These cognitive alterations were associated with modifications of expression of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors, postsynaptic density protein 95, and glial fibrillary acidic protein in mouse cortex or hippocampus by the arachidonic acid-enriched diet and Abeta oligomer administration. This diet also led to an imbalance between the main omega-6 fatty acids and the omega-3 fatty acids in favor of the first one in erythrocytes and the liver as well as in the hippocampal and cortical brain structures. In the cortex, the dietary arachidonic acid also induced an increase of arachidonic acid-containing phospholipid species in phosphatidylserine class, whereas intracerebroventricular injections modified several arachidonic acid- and docosahexaenoic acid-containing species in the four phospholipid classes. Finally, we observed that dietary arachidonic acid decreased the expression of the neuronal form of acyl-coenzyme A synthetase 4 in the hippocampus and increased the cytosolic phospholipase A2 activation level in the cortices of the mice. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary arachidonic acid could amplify Abeta oligomer neurotoxicity. Its consumption could constitute a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease in humans and should be taken into account in future preventive strategies. Its deleterious effect on cognitive capacity could be linked to the balance between arachidonic acid-mobilizing enzymes.",

    "title": "Amyloid precursor protein drives down-regulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation independent of amyloid beta.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its extracellular domain, soluble APP alpha (sAPPalpha) play important physiological and neuroprotective roles. However, rare forms of familial Alzheimer's disease are associated with mutations in APP that increase toxic amyloidogenic cleavage of APP and produce amyloid beta (Abeta) at the expense of sAPPalpha and other non-amyloidogenic fragments. Although mitochondrial dysfunction has become an established hallmark of neurotoxicity, the link between Abeta and mitochondrial function is unclear. In this study we investigated the effects of increased levels of neuronal APP or Abeta on mitochondrial metabolism and gene expression, in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Increased non-amyloidogenic processing of APP, but not Abeta, profoundly decreased respiration and enhanced glycolysis, while mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcripts were decreased, without detrimental effects to cell growth. These effects cannot be ascribed to Abeta toxicity, since higher levels of endogenous Abeta in our models do not cause oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) perturbations. Similarly, chemical inhibition of beta-secretase decreased mitochondrial respiration, suggesting that non-amyloidogenic processing of APP may be responsible for mitochondrial changes. Our results have two important implications, the need for caution in the interpretation of mitochondrial perturbations in models where APP is overexpressed, and a potential role of sAPPalpha or other non-amyloid APP fragments as acute modulators of mitochondrial metabolism.",

Contrary to past and current efforts, we utilize a mammalian non-self-antigen as an immunogen. The small, non-self peptide selected was covalently polymerized with glutaraldehyde until it reached a high beta-sheet secondary structure content, and species between 10-100kDa that are immunogenic, stable and soluble (p13Bri). Inoculation of p13Bri in mice elicited antibodies to the peptide and the beta-sheet secondary structure conformation. Hybridomas were produced and clones selected for their reactivity with at least two different oligomeric conformers from Alzheimer's, Parkinson and/or Prion diseases. The resulting conformational monoclonals are able to detect pathological oligomeric forms in different human neurodegenerative diseases by ELISA, immunohistochemistry and immunoblots. This technological approach may be useful to develop tools for detection, monitoring and treatment of multiple misfolding disorders.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is caused due to aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide into soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils in the brain. In this study, we have performed room temperature molecular dynamics simulations to probe the size-dependent conformational features and thermodynamic stabilities of five Abeta17-42 protofilaments, namely, O5 (pentamer), O8 (octamer), O10 (decamer), O12 (dodecamer), and O14 (tetradecamer). Analysis of the free energy profiles of the aggregates showed that the higher order protofilaments (O10, O12, and O14) undergo conformational transitions between two minimum energy states separated by small energy barriers, while the smaller aggregates (O5 and O8) remain in single deep minima surrounded by high barriers. Importantly, it is demonstrated that O10 is the crossover point for which the twisting of the protofilament is maximum, beyond which the monomers tend to rearrange themselves in an intermediate state and eventually transform into more stable conformations. Our results suggest that the addition of monomers along the axis of an existing protofilament with a critical size (O10 according to the present study) proceeds via an intermediate step with relatively less stable twisted structure that allows the additional monomers to bind and form stable larger protofilaments with minor rearrangements among themselves. More importantly, it is demonstrated that a combination of twist angle and end-to-end distance can be used as a suitable reaction coordinate to describe the growth mechanism of Abeta protofilaments in simulation studies.",

    "abstract": "Prenatal stress (PS) is one of adverse life events during pregnancy, which may increase vulnerability to cognitive impairment in adult offspring. Abeta synaptotoxicity is one important pathological factor for cognitive impairment, and PS-induced cognitive disorder is closely associated with N-Methyl-d-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR), which acts as a key mediator of Abeta synaptotoxicity. In the present study, we tried to explore whether PS affects offspring's Abeta levels and NMDAR subunit expression in a gender-specific manner in hippocampal CA and DG subregions, and whether PS affects synaptic proteins and NMDAR subunit expression in cultured offspring hippocampal cells exposed to Abeta. Pregnant SD rats with restraint stress from gestation day 8-20 were used as PS model. Morris water maze, ELISA, immunofluorescence and western blot were tested on postnatal day 90 in male and female PS offspring. Our results showed that female offspring is more vulnerable to PS-induced cognitive impairment. Surprisingly, PS enhanced Abeta1-40 levels in the hippocampal DG subregion of male offspring. Furthermore, WB results implied that the decreased GluN2A in CA of female may contribute to the PS-induced cognitive impairment, while in DG, the increased GluN2A and decreased GluN2B contributed to protective effects against Abeta. Interestingly, we found PS could alleviate Abeta synaptotoxicity in male offspring's hippocampal cells. Overall, our results provided a fundamental understanding of PS-induced gender-specific alterations of NMDAR subunit expression and the susceptibility to Abeta, and paved the road for the development of timely preventive interventions on cognitive disorders of PS offspring.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides into senile plaques in the brain. While most familial mutations are associated with early-onset AD, recent studies report the AD-protective nature of two genetic human Abeta variants, i.e. A2T and A2V, in the heterozygous state. The mixture of A2V Abeta1-6 (Abeta6) hexapeptide and WT Abeta1-42 (Alphabeta42) is also found neuroprotective. Motivated by these findings, in this study we investigate the effects of WT, A2V, and A2T Abeta6 hexapeptide binding on the monomeric WT Abeta42 landscape. For this purpose, we have performed extensive atomistic Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics simulations, elucidating preferential binding of Abeta42 with the A2V and A2T hexapeptides compared to WT Abeta6. A notable reorganization of the Abeta42 landscape is revealed due to hexapeptide association, as manifested by lowering of transient interactions between the central and C-terminal hydrophobic patches. Concurrently, Abeta6-bound Abeta42 monomer exhibits alternative structural features that are strongly dependent on the hexapeptide sequence. For example, a central helix is more frequently populated within the A2T-bound monomer, while A2V-bound Abeta42 is often enhanced in overall disorder. Taken together, the present simulations offer novel molecular insights onto the effect of the N-terminal hexapeptide binding on the Abeta42 monomer structure, which might help in explaining their reported amyloid inhibition properties.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that extracellular deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and microglia-mediated neuroinflammation are major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF-8), an important transcription factor of the IRF family, is highly restricted in microglia in brains. The expression pattern and function of IRF-8 in AD need to be elucidated in order to provide novel therapies for the treatment of AD. In this study, our results indicated that expression of IRF-8 is significantly elevated in the brains and microglia of AD transgenic model Tg2576 mice. Notably, in vitro cell culture and reporter luciferase assay show that Abeta1-40 treatment promotes expression of IRF-8 at the transcriptional level. Silencing of IRF-8 in microglia abolished Abeta1-40-induced elevation in typical activated microglia-related genes, including the microglial innate response receptor toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), the chemotaxis gene purinergic receptor P2Y12R, and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta. However, overexpression of IRF-8 exacerbated the elevated expression of these proteins. Finally, the JAK2/STAT-1 pathway was found to mediate Abeta1-40-induced elevation of IRF-8. Overall, this is the first time to report that IRF-8 is involved in microglial activation and neuroinflammation in AD.",

The fibrils of pGlu11 -Abeta (11-40) were more toxic than wildtype Abeta (1-40) and the longer pGlu3-Abeta (3-40) especially at higher concentration, whereas the overall morphology was quite similar. The secondary structure of pGlu11 -Abeta (11-40) fibrils shows the typical two beta-strands connected by a short turn as known for mature fibrils of Abeta (1-40) and also pGlu3 -Abeta (3-40). Further insights into tertiary contacts exhibit some similarities of pGlu11 -Abeta (11-40) fibrils with wildtype Abeta (1-40), but also a so far not described contact between Gly25 and Ile31 . This highlights the biological importance of chemical modifications on the molecular structure of Abeta.",

Using an unbiased screen targeting endogenous gene expression, we discovered that the beta2-adrenoreceptor (beta2AR) is a regulator of the alpha-synuclein gene (SNCA). beta2AR ligands modulate SNCA transcription through histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation of its promoter and enhancers. Over 11 years of follow-up in 4 million Norwegians, the beta2AR agonist salbutamol, a brain-penetrant asthma medication, was associated with reduced risk of developing PD (rate ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.58 to 0.76). Conversely, a beta2AR antagonist correlated with increased risk. beta2AR activation protected model mice and patient-derived cells. Thus, beta2AR is linked to transcription of alpha-synuclein and risk of PD in a ligand-specific fashion and constitutes a potential target for therapies.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia with dramatic consequences. The research in structural and functional neuroimaging showed altered brain connectivity in AD. In this study, we investigated the whole-brain resting state functional connectivity (FC) of the subjects with preclinical Alzheimer's disease (PAD), mild cognitive impairment due to AD (MCI) and mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), the impact of APOE4 carriership, as well as in relation to variations in core AD CSF biomarkers. The synchronization in the whole-brain was monotonously decreasing during the course of the disease progression. Furthermore, in AD patients we found widespread significant decreases in functional connectivity (FC) strengths particularly in the brain regions with high global connectivity. We employed a whole-brain computational modeling approach to study the mechanisms underlying these alterations. To characterize the causal interactions between brain regions, we estimated the effective connectivity (EC) in the model. We found that the significant EC differences in AD were primarily located in left temporal lobe. Then, we systematically manipulated the underlying dynamics of the model to investigate simulated changes in FC based on the healthy control subjects. Furthermore, we found distinct patterns involving CSF biomarkers of amyloid-beta (Abeta1 - 42) total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau). CSF Abeta1 - 42 was associated to the contrast between healthy control subjects and clinical groups. Nevertheless, tau CSF biomarkers were associated to the variability in whole-brain synchronization and sensory integration regions. These associations were robust across clinical groups, unlike the associations that were found for CSF Abeta1 - 42. APOE4 carriership showed no significant correlations with the connectivity measures.",

    "abstract": "The benzothiazole-aniline derivative Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) is the prototypical amyloid affinity probe developed for the in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) detection of amyloid beta (Abeta) deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specific high-affinity binding sites for PiB have been found to vary among AD cases with comparable Abeta load, and they are virtually absent on human-sequence Abeta deposits in animal models, none of which develop the full phenotype of AD. PiB thus could be an informative probe for studying the pathobiology of Abeta, but little is known about the localization of PiB binding at the molecular or structural level. By functionalizing the 6-hydroxy position of PiB with a PEG3 spacer and a terminal alkyne (propargyl) moiety, we have developed a clickable PiB compound that was derivatized with commercially available azide-labeled fluorophores or affinity-tags using copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions, commonly referred to as \"click\" chemistry. We have determined that both the clickable PiB derivative and its fluorescently labeled conjugate have low nanomolar binding affinities for synthetic Abeta aggregates. Furthermore, the fluorescent-PiB conjugate can effectively bind Abeta aggregates in human AD brain homogenates and tissue sections. By covalently coupling PiB to magnetic beads, Abeta aggregates were also affinity-captured from AD brain extracts. Thus, the clickable PiB derivative described herein can be used to generate a wide variety of covalent conjugates, with applications including the fluorescence detection of Abeta, the ultrastructural localization of PiB binding, and the affinity capture and structural characterization of Abeta and other cofactors from AD brains.",

Currently, only acethylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors and glutamate antagonist have been approved to the palliative treatment of AD. Although they have a short-term symptomatic benefits, their clinical use have revealed important non-cholinergic functions for AChE such its chaperone role in beta-amyloid toxicity. We propose here the design, synthesis and evaluation of non-toxic dual binding site AChEIs by hybridization of indanone and quinoline heterocyclic scaffolds. Unexpectely, we have found a potent allosteric modulator of AChE able to target cholinergic and non-cholinergic functions by fixing a specific AChE conformation, confirmed by STD-NMR and molecular modeling studies. Furthermore the promising biological data obtained on human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell assays for the new allosteric hybrid 14, led us to propose it as a valuable pharmacological tool for the study of non-cholinergic functions of AChE, and as a new important lead for novel disease modifying agents against AD.",

In this study, we showed that a pectic polysaccharide, LFA03-a, was extracted from Lonicera japonica Thunb. flowers and purified with DEAE-cellulose and Sephacryl S-100HR. LFA03-a was composed of rhamnose, arabinose, galactose and galacturonic acid in the molar ratio of 18.1:25.3:36.8:19.5. Its structure was determined to possess a rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I) backbone consisting of alpha-l-1,2-Rhap and alpha-d-1,4-GalAp disaccharide repeating unit, substituted at O-4 of l-rhamnose. The side chain was involved with beta-d-1,4-Galp, beta-d-1,3-Galp, beta-d-1,3,6-Galp and branched alpha-l-1,5-Araf. Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis with thioflavine T (ThT) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) results showed that LFA03-a inhibited Abeta42 aggregation in a dose dependent manner and impeded Abeta42 oligomerization and fibril formation.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the loss of neurogenesis and excessive induction of apoptosis. The induction of neurogenesis and inhibition of apoptosis may be a promising therapeutic approach to combating the disease. Celecoxib (CB), a cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitor, could offer neuroprotection. Specifically, the CB-encapsulated erythrocyte membranes (CB-RBCMs) sustained the release of CB over a period of 72 h in vitro and exhibited high brain biodistribution efficiency following intranasal administration, which resulted in the clearance of aggregated beta-amyloid proteins (Abeta) in neurons. The high accumulation of the CB-RBCMs in neurons resulted in a decrease in the neurotoxicity of CB and an increase in the migratory activity of neurons, and alleviated cognitive decline in APP/PS1 transgenic (Tg) mice. Indeed, COX-2 metabolic products including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and PGD2, PGE2 induced neurogenesis by enhancing the expression of SOD2 and 14-3-3zeta, and PGD2 stimulated apoptosis by increasing the expression of BIK and decreasing the expression of ARRB1. To this end, the CB-RBCMs achieved better effects on concurrently increasing neurogenesis and decreasing apoptosis than the phospholipid membrane-encapsulated CB liposomes (CB-PSPD-LPs), which are critical for the development and progression of AD. Therefore, CB-RBCMs provide a rational design to treat AD by promoting the self-repairing capacity of the brain.",

    "title": "Brain ureido degenerative protein modifications are associated with neuroinflammation and proteinopathy in Alzheimer's disease with cerebrovascular disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Brain degenerative protein modifications (DPMs) are associated with the apparition and progression of dementia, and at the same time, Alzheimer's disease with cerebrovascular disease (AD + CVD) is the most prevalent form of dementia in the elder population. Thus, understanding the role(s) of brain DPMs in this dementia subtype may provide novel insight on the disease pathogenesis and may aid on the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Two essential DPMs known to promote inflammation in several human diseases are the ureido DPMs (uDPMs) arginine citrullination and lysine carbamylation, although they have distinct enzymatic and non-enzymatic origins, respectively. Nevertheless, the implication of uDPMs in the neuropathology of dementia remains poorly understood. METHODS: In this study, we use the state-of-the-art, ultracentrifugation-electrostatic repulsion hydrophilic interaction chromatography (UC-ERLIC)-coupled mass spectrometry technology to undertake a comparative characterization of uDPMs in the soluble and particulate postmortem brain fractions of subjects diagnosed with AD + CVD and age-matched controls. RESULTS: An increase in the formation of uDPMs was observed in all the profiled AD + CVD brains. Citrulline-containing proteins were found more abundant in the soluble fraction of AD + CVD whereas homocitrulline-containing proteins were preferentially abundant in the particulate fraction of AD + CVD brains. Several dementia-specific citrulline residues were also identified in soluble proteins previously categorized as pro-immunogenic, which include the receptor P2X7, alpha-internexin, GFAP, CNP, MBP, and histones. Similarly, diverse dementia-specific homocitrulline residues were also observed in the particulate fractions of AD + CVD in proteins that have been vastly implicated in neuropathology. Intriguingly, we also found that the amino acids immediately flanking arginine residues may specifically influence the increase in protein citrullination. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results indicate that uDPMs widely contribute to the pathophysiology of AD + CVD by promoting neuroinflammation and proteinopathy. Furthermore, the obtained results could help to identify disease-associated proteins that can act as potential targets for therapeutic intervention or as novel biomarkers of specific neuropathology.",

At this regard no evidence still exists in vivo. In this study we explored the relationships between CSF pressure and AD pathology, as measured with CSF core biomarkers. We enrolled 16 patients with probable AD and 21 controls, collecting demographics, clinical data, CSF opening pressure and CSF levels of beta-amyloid-42 fragment (Abeta42), total-tau (t-tau), phosphorylated-tau-181 (p-tau), albumin and albumin ratio. Differences between the groups were calculated with non-parametric tests, while correlations among all parameters were separately calculated with Spearman's test in each group. The groups significantly differed in biomarkers' concentration with lower Abeta42, and higher t-tau and p-tau in AD patients. Moreover, CSF pressure was significantly lower in AD group (11.0 +- 2.8 vs. 13.3 +- 3.0 mmHg, p < 0.05) and directly correlated with Abeta42 levels (R = 0.512; p < 0.05), but not with other biomarkers or parameters. No significant correlations emerged for biomarkers in control group. AD patients exhibit low CSF pressure whose values are directly and selectively related to CSF Abeta42 levels. This interesting correlation may confirm in vivo the association between CSF dynamic and beta-amyloid metabolism occurring in AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is still a substantial unmet need for less invasive and lower-cost blood-based biomarkers to detect brain Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. This study is aimed to determine whether quantification of plasma tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) is informative in the diagnosis of AD. METHODS: We have developed a novel ultrasensitive immunoassay to quantify plasma p-tau181, and measured the levels of plasma p-tau181 in three cohorts. RESULTS: In the first cohort composed of 20 AD patients and 15 age-matched controls, the plasma levels of p-tau181 were significantly higher in the AD patients than those in the controls (0.171 +- 0.166 pg/ml in AD versus 0.0405 +- 0.0756 pg/ml in controls, p = 0.0039). The percentage of the subjects whose levels of plasma p-tau181 exceeded the cut-off value (0.0921 pg/ml) was significantly higher in the AD group compared with the control group (60% in AD versus 16.7% in controls, p = 0.0090). In the second cohort composed of 20 patients with Down syndrome (DS) and 22 age-matched controls, the plasma concentrations of p-tau181 were significantly higher in the DS group (0.767 +- 1.26 pg/ml in DS versus 0.0415 +- 0.0710 pg/ml in controls, p = 0.0313). There was a significant correlation between the plasma levels of p-tau181 and age in the DS group (R2 = 0.4451, p = 0.0013). All of the DS individuals showing an extremely high concentration of plasma p-tau181 (> 1.0 pg/ml) were older than the age of 40. In the third cohort composed of 8 AD patients and 3 patients with other neurological diseases, the levels of plasma p-tau181 significantly correlated with those of CSF p-tau181 (R2 = 0.4525, p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: We report for the first time quantitative data on the plasma levels of p-tau181 in controls and patients with AD and DS, and these data suggest that the plasma p-tau181 is a promising blood biomarker for brain AD pathology. This exploratory pilot study warrants further large-scale and well-controlled studies to validate the usefulness of plasma p-tau181 as an urgently needed surrogate marker for the diagnosis and disease progression of AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly viewed as a disease of synapses. Loss of synapses correlates better with cognitive decline than amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the hallmark neuropathological lesions of AD. Soluble forms of amyloid-beta (Abeta) have emerged as mediators of synapse dysfunction. Abeta binds to, accumulates, and aggregates in synapses. However, the anatomical and neurotransmitter specificity of Abeta and the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) in AD remain poorly understood. In addition, the relative roles of Abeta and AbetaPP in the development of AD, at pre- versus post-synaptic compartments and axons versus dendrites, respectively, remain unclear. Here we use immunogold electron microscopy and confocal microscopy to provide evidence for heterogeneity in the localization of Abeta/AbetaPP. We demonstrate that Abeta binds to a subset of synapses in cultured neurons, with preferential binding to glutamatergic compared to GABAergic neurons. We also highlight the challenge of defining pre- versus post-synaptic localization of this binding by confocal microscopy. Further, endogenous Abeta42 accumulates in both glutamatergic and GABAergic AbetaPP/PS1 transgenic primary neurons, but at varying levels. Moreover, upon knock-out of presenilin 1 or inhibition of gamma-secretase AbetaPP C-terminal fragments accumulate both pre- and post-synaptically; however earlier pre-synaptically, consistent with a higher rate of AbetaPP processing in axons. A better understanding of the synaptic and anatomical selectivity of Abeta/AbetaPP in AD can be important for the development of more effective new therapies for this major disease of aging.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the therapeutic utility of the autophagy enhancing stable disaccharide trehalose in the Tg2576 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) via an oral gavage of a 2% trehalose solution for 31 days. Furthermore, as AD is a neurodegenerative condition in which the transition metals, iron, copper, and zinc, are understood to be intricately involved in the cellular cascades leading to the defining pathologies of the disease, we sought to determine any parallel impact of trehalose treatment on metal levels. Trehalose treatment significantly improved performance in the Morris water maze, consistent with enhanced learning and memory. The improvement was not associated with significant modulation of full length amyloid-beta protein precursor or other amyloid-beta fragments. Trehalose had no effect on autophagy as assessed by western blot of the LC3-1 to LC3-2 protein ratio, and no alteration in biometals that might account for the improved cognition was observed. Biochemical analysis revealed a significant increase in the hippocampus of both synaptophysin, a synaptic vesicle protein and surrogate marker of synapses, and doublecortin, a reliable marker of neurogenesis. The growth factor progranulin was also significantly increased in the hippocampus and cortex with trehalose treatment. This study suggests that trehalose might invoke a suite of neuroprotective mechanisms that can contribute to improved cognitive performance in AD that are independent of more classical trehalose-mediated pathways, such as Abeta reduction and activation of autophagy. Thus, trehalose may have utility as a potential AD therapeutic, with conceivable implications for the treatment of other neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is proposed to trigger memory deficits and synaptic damage at the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is unknown how mitochondria dysfunction might trigger synaptotoxicity and if a differential susceptibility of mitochondria located in synapses underlies the greater glutamatergic than GABAergic synaptotoxicity in early AD. Hippocampal synaptosomes (purified synapses) of a rat model of early AD, typified by selective memory deficits two weeks after intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta1-42, 2 nmol), simultaneously displayed three mitochondria-associated deleterious alterations: 1) hampered metabolism (decreased MTT reduction); 2) increased oxygen radical production (increased hydrogen peroxide production); 3) increased caspase-3 activity. The direct exposure of hippocampal synaptosomes to Abeta1-42 (500 nM) similarly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (TMRM+ fluorescence) and increased mitochondria-derived oxygen radicals (MitoTraker red-CM-H2Xros fluorescence) in individual glutamatergic (vesicular glutamate transporter-immunopositive) and GABAergic (vesicular GABA transporter-immunopositive) synaptosomes. However, significantly more glutamatergic than GABAergic synaptosomes were endowed with mitochondria (Tom20-immunopositive). These results indicate that dysfunctional mitochondria located in synapses can trigger synaptotoxicity through multifaceted mechanisms and that it is not the susceptibility of mitochondria to Abeta but more likely a different impact of dysfunctional mitochondria that underlies the greater sensitivity to synaptotoxicity of glutamatergic than GABA synapses in early AD.",

    "abstract": "The growth of amyloid fibrils from Abeta1-42 peptide, one of the key pathogenic players in Alzheimer's disease, is believed to follow a nucleation-elongation mechanism. Fibril elongation is often described as a \"dock-lock\" procedure, where a disordered monomer adsorbs to an existing fibril in a relatively fast process (docking), followed by a slower conformational transition toward the ordered state of the template (locking). Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations of an ordered pentamer of Abeta42 at fully atomistic resolution, which includes solvent, to characterize the elongation process. We construct a Markov state model from an ensemble of short trajectories generated by an advanced sampling algorithm that efficiently diversifies a subset of the system without any bias forces. This subset corresponds to selected dihedral angles of the peptide chain at the fibril tip favored to be the fast growing one experimentally. From the network model, we extract distinct locking pathways covering time scales in the high microsecond regime. Slow steps are associated with the exchange of hydrophobic contacts, between nonnative and native intermolecular contacts as well as between intra- and intermolecular ones. The N-terminal segments, which are disordered in fibrils and typically considered inert, are able to shield the lateral interfaces of the pentamer. We conclude by discussing our findings in the context of a refined dock-lock model of Abeta fibril elongation, which involves structural disorder for more than one monomer at the growing tip.",

In the ER stress condition, part of the ER resident chaperones is known to be translocated to another cellular location, such as the cell surface. The ER chaperone 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), which shows ATP-dependent chaperone activity, also shows translocation to the cell surface. In this study, we examined the influence of GRP78 on Abeta fibrillation in the presence or absence of ATP. We revealed that a small amount of GRP78 effectively inhibited fibrillation of Abeta fragments. Intriguingly, the fibrillation inhibition by GRP78 was confirmed in the absence of ATP, suggesting GRP78 exhibited ATP-independent interaction with Abeta fragments.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), which is produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP), is the primary cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Autophagy recycles cellular components and digests intracellular components including Abeta. The Ca2+- and Mg2+-permeable transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) channel underlies the constitutive Ca2+ influx in some cells. Since we already reported that TRPM7 channel-mediated Ca2+ influx regulates basal autophagy, we hypothesize that the activation of TRPM7 channel could increase basal autophagy and consequently decrease Abeta. In this study, we showed that naltriben (NTB), a specific TRPM7 channel activator, induced Ca2+ influx and activated autophagic signaling in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. NTB also promoted co-localization of LC3 and APP, and reduced Abeta. Furthermore, we found that an early-onset familial AD-associated presenilin1 DeltaE9 (PS1 DeltaE9) mutant cells had attenuated basal autophagy. NTB was able to recover autophagy and decrease Abeta in PS1 DeltaE9 cells. Our results show that the activating TRPM7 channel may prevent AD-related Abeta neuropathology via modulating Ca2+-regulated basal autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides is a significant event that underpins Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. Abeta aggregates, especially the low-molecular weight oligomers, are the primary toxic agents in AD and hence, there is increasing interest in understanding their formation and behavior. Aggregation is a nucleation-dependent process in which the pre-nucleation events are dominated by Abeta homotypic interactions. Dynamic flux and stochasticity during pre-nucleation renders the reactions susceptible to perturbations by other molecules. In this context, we investigate the heterotypic interactions between Abeta and fatty acids (FAs) by two independent tool-sets such as reduced order modelling (ROM) and ensemble kinetic simulation (EKS). We observe that FAs influence Abeta dynamics distinctively in three broadly-defined FA concentration regimes containing non-micellar, pseudo-micellar or micellar phases. While the non-micellar phase promotes on-pathway fibrils, pseudo-micellar and micellar phases promote predominantly off-pathway oligomers, albeit via subtly different mechanisms. Importantly off-pathway oligomers saturate within a limited molecular size, and likely with a different overall conformation than those formed along the on-pathway, suggesting the generation of distinct conformeric strains of Abeta, which may have profound phenotypic outcomes. Our results validate previous experimental observations and provide insights into potential influence of biological interfaces in modulating Abeta aggregation pathways.",

    "title": "MMP-7 cleaves amyloid beta fragment peptides and copper ion inhibits the degradation.",
    "abstract": "The extracellular deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) is known to be the fundamental cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta1-42, generated by beta-secretases from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), is the main component of neuritic plaque, and the aggregation of this protein is shown to be dependent to an extent on metal ions such as copper and zinc. However, the mechanism by which Cu2+ affects the physicochemical properties of Abeta1-42 or the central nervous system is still under debate. A recent series of studies have demonstrated that both the soluble-type matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and the membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) are capable of degrading Abeta peptides. MMP-7, one of the soluble-type matrix metalloproteinases, is expressed in hippocampal tissue; however, less information is available concerning the pathophysiological roles of this enzyme in the process and/or progress of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we examined the degradation activity of MMP-7 against various Abeta1-42's fragment peptides and the effect of Cu2+. Although Abeta22-40 was degraded by MMP-7 regardless of Cu2+, Cu2+ inhibited the degradation of Abeta1-19, Abeta11-20, and Abeta11-29 by MMP-7. These results indicate that MMP-7 is capable of degrading Abeta1-42, and that Abeta1-42 acquired resistance against MMP-7 cleavage through Cu2+-binding and structure changes. Our results demonstrate that MMP-7 may play an important role in the defensive mechanism against the aggregation of Abeta1-42, which gives rise to the pathology of AD.",

    "abstract": "The progressive aging of the world's population makes a higher prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases inevitable. The necessity for an accurate, but at the same time, inexpensive and minimally invasive, diagnostic test is urgently required, not only to confirm the presence of the disease but also to discriminate between different types of dementia to provide the appropriate management and treatment. In this study, attenuated total reflection FTIR (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometric techniques were used to analyze blood plasma samples from our cohort. Blood samples are easily collected by conventional venepuncture, permitting repeated measurements from the same individuals to monitor their progression throughout the years or evaluate any tested drugs. We included 549 individuals: 347 with various neurodegenerative diseases and 202 age-matched healthy individuals. Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 164) was identified with 70% sensitivity and specificity, which after the incorporation of apolipoprotein epsilon4 genotype (APOE epsilon4) information, increased to 86% when individuals carried one or two alleles of epsilon4, and to 72% sensitivity and 77% specificity when individuals did not carry epsilon4 alleles. Early AD cases (n = 14) were identified with 80% sensitivity and 74% specificity. Segregation of AD from dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; n = 34) was achieved with 90% sensitivity and specificity. Other neurodegenerative diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD; n = 30), Parkinson's disease (PD; n = 32), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; n = 31), were included in our cohort for diagnostic purposes. Our method allows for both rapid and robust diagnosis of neurodegeneration and segregation between different dementias.",

    "title": "Effect of a Paramagnetic Spin Label on the Intrinsically Disordered Peptide Ensemble of Amyloid-beta.",
    "abstract": "Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement is an NMR technique that has yielded important insight into the structure of folded proteins, although the perturbation introduced by the large spin probe might be thought to diminish its usefulness when applied to characterizing the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). We compare the computationally generated structural ensembles of the IDP amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42) to an alternative sequence in which a nitroxide spin label attached to cysteine has been introduced at its N-terminus. Based on this internally consistent computational comparison, we find that the spin label does not perturb the signature population of the beta-hairpin formed by residues 16-21 and 29-36 that is dominant in the Abeta42 reference ensemble. However, the presence of the tag induces a strong population shift in a subset of the original Abeta42 structural sub-populations, including a sevenfold enhancement of the beta-hairpin formed by residues 27-31 and 33-38. Through back-calculation of NMR observables from the computational structural ensembles, we show that the structural differences between the labeled and unlabeled peptide would be evident in local residual dipolar couplings, and possibly differences in homonuclear 1H-1H nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) and heteronuclear 1H-15N NOEs if the paramagnetic contribution to the longitudinal relaxation does not suppress the NOE intensities in the real experiment. This work shows that molecular simulation provides a complementary approach to resolving the potential structural perturbations introduced by reporter tags that can aid in the interpretation of paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, double electron-electron resonance, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments applied to IDPs.",

METHODS: We examined self-reported and study partner-based SMC in 52 young, cognitively unimpaired individuals from a Colombian kindred with early-onset ADAD. Twenty-six carried the PSEN-1 E280A mutation, averaging 7 years of age younger than the kindred's expected clinical onset. Twenty-six were age-matched noncarriers. Participants also underwent structural MRI and cognitive testing. RESULTS: Self-reported SMC were greater in carriers than noncarriers (p = 0.02). Study partner-based SMC did not differ between groups (p = 0.21), but in carriers increased with age (r = 0.66, p < 0.001) and decreased with hippocampal volume (r = -0.35, p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitively unimpaired PSEN-1 carriers have elevated SMC. Self-reported SMC may be a relatively early indicator of preclinical AD, while partner- reported SMC increases later in preclinical AD, closer to clinical onset.",

Here we studied dopaminergic neurons derived from patients with idiopathic and familial PD. We identified a time-dependent pathological cascade beginning with mitochondrial oxidant stress leading to oxidized dopamine accumulation and ultimately resulting in reduced glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity, lysosomal dysfunction, and alpha-synuclein accumulation. This toxic cascade was observed in human, but not in mouse, PD neurons at least in part because of species-specific differences in dopamine metabolism. Increasing dopamine synthesis or alpha-synuclein amounts in mouse midbrain neurons recapitulated pathological phenotypes observed in human neurons. Thus, dopamine oxidation represents an important link between mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction in PD pathogenesis.",

    "title": "Defining Optimal Brain Health in Adults: A Presidential Advisory From the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.",
    "abstract": "Cognitive function is an important component of aging and predicts quality of life, functional independence, and risk of institutionalization. Advances in our understanding of the role of cardiovascular risks have shown them to be closely associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. Because many cardiovascular risks are modifiable, it may be possible to maintain brain health and to prevent dementia in later life. The purpose of this American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association presidential advisory is to provide an initial definition of optimal brain health in adults and guidance on how to maintain brain health. We identify metrics to define optimal brain health in adults based on inclusion of factors that could be measured, monitored, and modified. From these practical considerations, we identified 7 metrics to define optimal brain health in adults that originated from AHA's Life's Simple 7: 4 ideal health behaviors (nonsmoking, physical activity at goal levels, healthy diet consistent with current guideline levels, and body mass index <25 kg/m2) and 3 ideal health factors (untreated blood pressure <120/<80 mm Hg, untreated total cholesterol <200 mg/dL, and fasting blood glucose <100 mg/dL). In addition, in relation to maintenance of cognitive health, we recommend following previously published guidance from the AHA/American Stroke Association, Institute of Medicine, and Alzheimer's Association that incorporates control of cardiovascular risks and suggest social engagement and other related strategies. We define optimal brain health but recognize that the truly ideal circumstance may be uncommon because there is a continuum of brain health as demonstrated by AHA's Life's Simple 7. Therefore, there is opportunity to improve brain health through primordial prevention and other interventions. Furthermore, although cardiovascular risks align well with brain health, we acknowledge that other factors differing from those related to cardiovascular health may drive cognitive health. Defining optimal brain health in adults and its maintenance is consistent with the AHA's Strategic Impact Goal to improve cardiovascular health of all Americans by 20% and to reduce deaths resulting from cardiovascular disease and stroke by 20% by the year 2020. This work in defining optimal brain health in adults serves to provide the AHA/American Stroke Association with a foundation for a new strategic direction going forward in cardiovascular health promotion and disease prevention.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a uniquely human brain disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) into extracellular plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) made from intracellular, abnormally phosphorylated tau, and selective neuronal loss. We analyzed a large group of aged chimpanzees (n = 20, age 37-62 years) for evidence of Abeta and tau lesions in brain regions affected by AD in humans. Abeta was observed in plaques and blood vessels, and tau lesions were found in the form of pretangles, NFT, and tau-immunoreactive neuritic clusters. Abeta deposition was higher in vessels than in plaques and correlated with increases in tau lesions, suggesting that amyloid build-up in the brain's microvasculature precedes plaque formation in chimpanzees. Age was correlated to greater volumes of Abeta plaques and vessels. Tangle pathology was observed in individuals that exhibited plaques and moderate or severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a condition in which amyloid accumulates in the brain's vasculature. Amyloid and tau pathology in aged chimpanzees suggests these AD lesions are not specific to the human brain.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Point mutations in the Abeta sequence, which cluster around the central hydrophobic core of the peptide, are associated with familial AD (FAD). Several mutations have been identified, with the Arctic mutation exhibiting a purely cognitive phenotype that is typical of AD. Our previous findings suggest that Arctic Abeta40 binds to and aggregates with CHRNA7, thereby inhibiting the calcium response and signaling pathways downstream of the receptor. Activation of CHRNA7 is neuroprotective both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated whether Arctic Abeta40 affects neuronal survival and/or death via CHRNA7. Using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, we found that the neuroprotective function of CHRNA7 is blocked by CHRNA7 knockdown using RNA interference. Furthermore, Arctic Abeta40 blocked the neuroprotective effect of nicotine by inhibiting the ERK1/2 pathway downstream of CHRNA7. Moreover, we show that ERK1/2 activation mediates the neuroprotective effect of nicotine against oxidative stress. Collectively, our findings further our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of Arctic FAD.",

Acrylamide-based glycomonomers with either beta-d-glucose or beta-d-galactose pendant groups were synthesized to mimic the stereochemistry of saccharides present in GM1 and characterized via 1H NMR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Glycopolymers of different molecular weights were synthesized by aqueous reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (aRAFT) polymerization and characterized by NMR and GPC. The polymers were used as models to investigate the effects of molecular weight and saccharide unit type on Abeta aggregation via thioflavin-T fluorescence and PAGE. High molecular weight (~350 DP) glucose-containing glycopolymers had a profound effect on Abeta aggregation, promoting formation of soluble oligomers of Abeta and limiting fibril production, while the other glycopolymers and negative control had little effect on the Abeta propagation process.",

    "abstract": "Ascorbate-induced release of heparan sulfate from S-nitrosylated heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican-1 takes place in endosomes. Heparan sulfate penetrates the membrane and is transported to the nucleus. This process is dependent on copper and on expression and processing of the amyloid precursor protein. It remains unclear how exogenously supplied ascorbate can generate HS-anMan in endosomes and how passage through the membrane is facilitated. Here we have examined wild-type, Alzheimer Tg2576 and amyloid precursor protein (-/-) mouse fibroblasts and human fetal and Niemann-Pick C1 fibroblasts by using deconvolution immunofluorescence microscopy, siRNA technology and [S35]sulfate-labeling, vesicle isolation and gel chromatography. We found that ascorbate-induced release of heparan sulfate was dependent on expression of endosomal cytochrome b561. Formation and nuclear transport of heparan sulfate was suppressed by inhibition of beta-processing of the amyloid precursor protein and formation was restored by copper (I) ions. Membrane penetration was not dependent on amyloid beta channel formation. Inhibition of endosomal exit resulted in accumulation of heparan sulfate in vesicles that exposed the C-terminal of the amyloid precursor protein externally. Endosome-to-nucleus transport was also dependent on expression of the Niemann-Pick C1 protein. We propose that ascorbate is taken up from the medium and is oxidized by cytochrome b561 which, in turn, reduces copper (II) to copper (I) present in the N-terminal, beta-cleaved domain of the amyloid precursor protein. Re-oxidation of copper (I) is coupled to reductive, deaminative release of heparan sulfate from glypican-1. Passage through the membrane may be facilitated by the C-terminal, beta-cleaved fragment of the amyloid precursor protein and the Niemann-Pick C1 protein.",

    "title": "Seed-induced acceleration of amyloid-beta mediated neurotoxicity in vivo.",
    "abstract": "Seeded propagation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology is suggested to contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Local overproduction of aggregation-prone Abeta variants could explain the focal initiation of a seeding cascade that subsequently triggers widespread pathology. Several animal models support this seeding concept by demonstrating accelerated Abeta deposition following inoculation with Abeta-containing homogenates, however its role in progressive neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we present a non-invasive approach to study Abeta seeding processes in vivo using Drosophila models. We show that small amounts of aggregation-competent Abeta42 seeds, generated in selected neuronal clusters, can induce the deposition of the pan-neuronally expressed and otherwise soluble Abeta40. Moreover, our models visualize the accelerated formation and propagation of amyloid pathology throughout the brain, which correlates with severe neurotoxicity. Taken together, these in vivo models provide mechanistic insights into disease-related processes and represent versatile genetic tools to determine novel modifiers of the Abeta seeding cascade.Seeding of amyloid beta from one brain region to another is thought to contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease, although to date most studies have depended on inoculation of animals with exogenous amyloid. Here the authors describe a genetic seed and target system in Drosophila which may be useful for the mechanistic study of seeding of amyloid in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian prions (PrPSc ) consist of misfolded, conformationally altered, self-replicating states of the sialoglycoprotein called prion protein or PrPC . Recent studies revealed that the sialylation status of PrPSc plays a major role in evading innate immunity and infecting a host. Establishing the type of linkage by which sialic acid residues are attached to galactose is important, as it helps to identify the sialyltransferases responsible for sialylating PrPC and outline strategies for manipulating the sialyation status of PrPSc . Using enzymatic treatment with sialidases and lectin blots, this study demonstrated that in N-linked glycans of PrPSc , the sialic acid residues are predominantly alpha 2,6-linked. High percentages of alpha 2,6-linked sialic acids were observed in PrPSc of three prion strains 22L, RML, and ME7, as well as PrPSc from brain, spleen, or N2a cells cultured in vitro. Moreover, the variation in the percentage of alpha 2,3- versus 2,6-linked sialic acid was found to be relatively minor between brain-, spleen-, or cell-derived PrPSc , suggesting that the type of linkage is independent of tissue type. Based on the current results, we propose that sialyltransferases of St6Gal family, which is responsible for attaching sialic acids via alpha 2,6-linkages to N-linked glycans, controls sialylation of PrPC and PrPSc .",

Here, we applied quantitative susceptibility mapping, a relatively new magnetic resonance imaging method sensitive to tissue iron, to assess the relationship between iron, amyloid-beta load, and cognitive decline in 117 subjects who underwent baseline magnetic resonance imaging and amyloid-beta positron emission tomography from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study (AIBL). Cognitive function data were collected every 18 months for up to 6 years from 100 volunteers who were either cognitively normal (n = 64) or diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (n = 17) or Alzheimer's disease (n = 19). Among participants with amyloid pathology (n = 45), higher hippocampal quantitative susceptibility mapping levels predicted accelerated deterioration in composite cognition tests for episodic memory [beta(standard error) = -0.169 (0.034), P = 9.2 x 10-7], executive function [beta(standard error) = -0.139 (0.048), P = 0.004), and attention [beta(standard error) = -0.074 (0.029), P = 0.012]. Deteriorating performance in a composite of language tests was predicted by higher quantitative susceptibility mapping levels in temporal lobe [beta(standard error) = -0.104 (0.05), P = 0.036] and frontal lobe [beta(standard error) = -0.154 (0.055), P = 0.006]. These findings indicate that brain iron might combine with amyloid-beta to accelerate clinical progression and that quantitative susceptibility mapping could be used in combination with amyloid-beta positron emission tomography to stratify individuals at risk of decline.",

METHODS: Seven hundred forty-two participants with NC and participants with eMCI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (second cohort [ADNI2] and Grand Opportunity Cohort [ADNI-GO]) were included. All had baseline florbetapir PET measured, and 526 had screening visit HV measured. Regression moderation models were used to examine whether A+ effects on Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test learning and delayed recall and right and left HV (adjusted for total intracranial volume) were moderated by diagnosis and sex. Age, cognition at screening, education, and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 carrier status were controlled. RESULTS: Women with A+, but not those with florbetapir PET amyloid negative (A-),eMCI showed poorer learning. For women with NC, there was no relationship of A+ with learning. In contrast, A+ men trended toward poorer learning regardless of diagnosis. A similar trend was found for verbal delayed recall: Women with A+, but not A-, eMCI trended toward reduced delayed recall; no effects were observed for women with NC or for men. Hippocampal analyses indicated that women with A+, but not those with A-, eMCI, trended toward smaller right HV; no significant A+ effects were observed for women with NC. Men showed similar, though nonsignificant, patterns of smaller right HV in A+ eMCI, but not in men with A- eMCI or NC. No interactive effects of sex were noted for left HV. CONCLUSIONS: Women with NC showed verbal learning and memory scores robust to A+, and women with A+ eMCI lost this advantage. In contrast, A+ impacted men's scores less significantly or not at all, and comparably across those with NC and eMCI. Sex marginally moderated the relationship of A+ and diagnosis with right HV, such that women with NC showed no A+ effect and women with A+ eMCI lost that advantage in neural integrity; the pattern in men was less clear. These findings show that women with A+ eMCI (i.e., prodromal AD) have differential neural and cognitive decline, which has implications for considering sex in early detection of AD and development of therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of microglia is known to play an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we investigated the role of RIPK1 in microglia mediating the pathogenesis of AD. RIPK1 is highly expressed by microglial cells in human AD brains. Using the amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic mouse model, we found that inhibition of RIPK1, using both pharmacological and genetic means, reduced amyloid burden, the levels of inflammatory cytokines, and memory deficits. Furthermore, inhibition of RIPK1 promoted microglial degradation of Abeta in vitro. We characterized the transcriptional profiles of adult microglia from APP/PS1 mice and identified a role for RIPK1 in regulating the microglial expression of CH25H and Cst7, a marker for disease-associated microglia (DAM), which encodes an endosomal/lysosomal cathepsin inhibitor named Cystatin F. We present evidence that RIPK1-mediated induction of Cst7 leads to an impairment in the lysosomal pathway. These data suggest that RIPK1 may mediate a critical checkpoint in the transition to the DAM state. Together, our study highlights a non-cell death mechanism by which the activation of RIPK1 mediates the induction of a DAM phenotype, including an inflammatory response and a reduction in phagocytic activity, and connects RIPK1-mediated transcription in microglia to the etiology of AD. Our results support that RIPK1 is an important therapeutic target for the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "We explored structural details of fibrils formed by a mutated amyloid beta (Abeta(1-40)) peptide carrying a Phe19 to Lys19 mutation, which was shown to completely abolish the toxicity of the molecule. Computer models suggest that the positively charged Lys19 side chain is expelled from the hydrophobic fibril interior upon fibrillation. This can be accommodated by either a 180  flip of the entire lower beta-strand (model M1) or local perturbations of the secondary structure in the direct vicinity of the mutated site (model M2). This is accompanied by the formation of a new salt bridge between Glu22 and Lys28 in model M1. Experimentally, a novel contact between Phe20 and Leu34 as well as the significant structural perturbation of residues 20-23 could be confirmed. However, the mutated fibrils do not show the formation of any salt bridges. This demonstrates that although morphologically very robust, local perturbations of the Abeta(1-40) sequence lead to moderate structural alterations with tremendous impact on the physiological importance of these aggregates, which may suggest alternative strategies for the development of a remedy against Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "In these last years, several phase III randomized controlled trials testing promising candidates sharing Abeta depots as target of their action have failed, despite showing some reductions of the brain Abeta charge. The announcements of the negative results have heated the discussion in the field and divided the scientific community between the defenders versus the opponents of the Abeta theory. In the present article, we discuss the limits of these drastic, opposite positions and we propose a novel approach to Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, a \"one-fits-all\" approach where a single biomarker/process is able to explain the clinical manifestation seems inadequate for AD (as for other conditions of old age). Accordingly, there is an urgent need to overcome the traditional paradigms of \"standalone-diseases\" (requiring unimodal interventions) in favor of more comprehensive and multidimensional approaches. Specifically, promoting biomarker modeling procedures based on multivariate statistical methodologies may have important implications and advantages in the field of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of cleaved tau fragments in the brain is associated with several tauopathies. For this reason, we recently developed a transgenic mouse that selectively accumulates a C-Terminal 35 kDa human tau fragment (Tau35). These animals develop progressive motor and spatial memory impairment, paralleled by increased hippocampal glycogen synthase kinase 3beta activity. In this neurophysiological study, we focused on the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus, a brain area involved in memory encoding. The accumulation of Tau35 results in a significant increase of short-term facilitation of the synaptic response in the theta frequency range (10 Hz), without affecting basal synaptic transmission and long-term synaptic plasticity. Tau35 expression also alters the intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Thus, Tau35 presence is associated with increased and decreased excitability at hyperpolarized and depolarized potentials, respectively. These observations are paralleled by a hyperpolarization of the voltage-sensitivity of noninactivating K+ currents. Further investigation is needed to assess the causal link between such functional alterations and the cognitive and motor impairments previously observed in this model.",

We previously reported that chronic treatment of AD with memantine reduces the amount of insoluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) and soluble Abeta oligomers in animal models of AD. The mechanisms by which memantine reduces Abeta levels in the brain were evaluated by determining the effect of memantine on Abeta aggregation using thioflavin T and transmission electron microscopy. Memantine inhibited the formation of Abeta(1-42) aggregates in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas amantadine, a structurally similar compound, did not affect Abeta aggregation at the same concentrations. Furthermore, memantine inhibited the formation of different types of Abeta aggregates, including Abetas carrying familial AD mutations, and disaggregated preformed Abeta(1-42) fibrils. These results suggest that the inhibition of Abeta aggregation and induction of Abeta disaggregation may be involved in the mechanisms by which memantine reduces Abeta deposition in the brain.",

    "title": "Rates of hippocampal atrophy and presence of post-mortem TDP-43 in patients with Alzheimer's disease: a longitudinal retrospective study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Post-mortem studies have not identified an association between beta-amyloid or tau and rates of hippocampal atrophy in patients with Alzheimer's disease. TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is another protein linked to Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to investigate whether hippocampal TDP-43 is associated with increased rates of hippocampal atrophy. METHODS: In this longitudinal retrospective study, we analysed post-mortem brain tissue of all individuals with an Alzheimer's disease spectrum pathological diagnosis who had antemortem head MRI scans between Jan 1, 1999, and Dec 31, 2012, and who had been recruited into the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry, or the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We did TDP-43 immunohistochemistry and classified individuals as follows: no TDP-43 in the amygdala or hippocampus; TDP-43 restricted to the amygdala; and TDP-43 spreading into the hippocampus. Each individual was also assigned a neurofibrillary tangle stage (B1-B3), relating to the likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease. We used longitudinal FreeSurfer software and tensor-based morphometry with symmetric normalisation to calculate hippocampal volume on all serial MRI scans and used linear mixed-effects regression models to estimate associations between TDP-43 and rate of hippocampal atrophy and to assess the trajectory of TDP-43-associated atrophy. FINDINGS: We identified 298 individuals meeting the inclusion criteria, with 816 usable MRI scans (spanning 1 0-11 2 years of the disease) available for analysis. 141 individuals showed no TDP-43 in the amygdala or hippocampus, 33 had TDP-43 restricted to the amygdala, and 124 had TDP-43 in the hippocampus. Among individuals with a high likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease (neurofibrillary tangle stage B3; n=205), those with hippocampal TDP-43 had faster rates of hippocampal atrophy (n=103, annual volume change -4 39%, 95% CI -4 82 to -3 95; p<0 0001) than did those with amygdala-only TDP-43 (n=20, -3 29%, -4 11 to -2 46; p<0 0001; difference -1 10%, 95% CI -2 02 to -0 19; p=0 02) and those without TDP-43 (n=82, -3 11%, -3 54 to -2 68; p<0 0001; difference -1 28%, -1 88 to -0 67; p<0 0001). Among individuals with an intermediate likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease (neurofibrillary tangle stage B2; n=56), those with hippocampal TDP-43 had faster rates of hippocampal atrophy (n=17, annual volume change -4 05%, 95% CI -5 09 to -2 99; p<0 0001) than did those with amygdala-only TDP-43 (n=6, -1 78%, -3 04 to -0 55; p=0 004; difference -2 27%, 95% CI -3 79 to -0 67; p=0 006) and those without TDP-43 (n=33, -1 63%, -2 43 to -0 83; p=0 0002; difference -2 43%, -3 66 to -1 18; p=0 0002). Hippocampal TDP-43 was not associated with the rate of hippocampal atrophy in individuals with a low likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease (neurofibrillary tangle stage B1; n=37). The trajectory analysis suggested that increased rates of TDP-43-associated hippocampal atrophy might occur at least 10 years before death. Results were similar for FreeSurfer and tensor-based morphometry. INTERPRETATION: TDP-43 should be considered as a potential factor related to increased rates of hippocampal atrophy in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Given the importance of hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease, it is imperative that techniques are developed for detection of TDP-43 in vivo.

    "title": "The influence of acidic media on the effect of beta-amyloid peptide on the function of glycine receptor in hippocampal neurons.",
    "abstract": "We have previously shown that application of beta-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Abeta) at picomolar/nanomolar concentrations caused a decrease in the peak amplitude and acceleration of desensitization of the glycine-activated chloride current (IGly) in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (Bukanova et al., 2016). The aim of this work was to study the effect of Abeta on IGly in an acidified medium. The relevance of this work is determined by the fact that the pathogenic effects of Abeta in Alzheimer's disease are usually accompanied by inflammatory processes and acidosis. The IGly was induced by 600 ms application of 100 muM (nearly EC50) or 500 muM (nearly saturating) glycine on isolated rat hippocampal neurons. The solution of glycine was neutral (pH 7.4) or acidic over a pH range of 5.0-7.0. It was found that 600 ms application of protons rapidly, reversibly and in dose-dependent manner decreased the peak amplitude and accelerated the desensitization of IGly. The effect of H+ on IGly desensitization did not depend on glycine concentration and may be considered noncompetitive, while the effect on IGly peak disappeared at saturating glycine concentration and can be regarded as a competitive. These characteristics of the proton effects on IGly coincide with the characteristics of the Abeta effects on IGly. Experiments with joint application of Abeta and H+ showed interdependence of their effects. Addition of Abeta to perfusing solution reduced H+ effects on IGly while long pretreatment of Abeta with acid solution prevented the effects of the peptide on IGly. Our results suggest the existence of common sites for Abeta and H+ on the GlyR and indicate a mutual weakening of the inhibitory action of these molecules on IGly.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies and fragments thereof are, because of high selectivity for their targets, considered as potential therapeutics and biomarkers for several neurological disorders. However, due to their large molecular size, antibodies/fragments do not easily penetrate into the brain. The aim of the present study was to improve the brain distribution via adsorptive-mediated transcytosis of an amyloid-beta (Abeta) protofibril selective F(ab')2 fragment (F(ab')2-h158). F(ab')2-h158 was cationized to different extents and the specific and unspecific binding was studied in vitro. Next, cationized F(ab')2-h158 was labelled with iodine-125 and its brain distribution and pharmacokinetics was studied in mice. Cationization did not alter the in vitro affinity to Abeta protofibrils, but increased the unspecific binding somewhat. Ex vivo experiments revealed a doubling of brain concentrations compared with unmodified F(ab')2-h158 and in vivo imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed that the cationized F(ab')2-h158, but not the unmodified F(ab')2-h158 could be visualized in the brain. To conclude, cationization is a means to increase brain concentrations of therapeutic antibodies or fragments and may facilitate the use of antibodies/fragments as imaging biomarkers in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is defined by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the formation of Lewy body inclusions containing aggregated alpha-synuclein. Efforts to explain dopamine neuron vulnerability are hindered by the lack of dopaminergic cell death in alpha-synuclein transgenic mice. To address this, we manipulated both dopamine levels and alpha-synuclein expression. Nigrally targeted expression of mutant tyrosine hydroxylase with enhanced catalytic activity increased dopamine levels without damaging neurons in non-transgenic mice. In contrast, raising dopamine levels in mice expressing human A53T mutant alpha-synuclein induced progressive nigrostriatal degeneration and reduced locomotion. Dopamine elevation in A53T mice increased levels of potentially toxic alpha-synuclein oligomers, resulting in conformationally and functionally modified species. Moreover, in genetically tractable Caenorhabditis elegans models, expression of alpha-synuclein mutated at the site of interaction with dopamine prevented dopamine-induced toxicity. These data suggest that a unique mechanism links two cardinal features of PD: dopaminergic cell death and alpha-synuclein aggregation.",

It is hypothesized that such individuals exhibit cognitive resilience that protects against AD dementia. We hypothesized that in cases with AD pathology, structural changes in dendritic spines would distinguish individuals who had or did not have clinical dementia. METHODS: We compared dendritic spines within layer II and III pyramidal neuron dendrites in Brodmann area 46 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using the Golgi-Cox technique in 12 age-matched pathology-free controls, 8 controls with AD pathology (CAD), and 21 AD cases. We used highly optimized methods to trace impregnated dendrites from bright-field microscopy images that enabled accurate 3-dimensional digital reconstruction of dendritic structure for morphologic analyses. RESULTS: Spine density was similar among control and CAD cases but was reduced significantly in AD. Thin and mushroom spines were reduced significantly in AD compared to CAD brains, whereas stubby spine density was decreased significantly in CAD and AD compared to controls. Increased spine extent distinguished CAD cases from controls and AD. Linear regression analysis of all cases indicated that spine density was not associated with neuritic plaque score but did display negative correlation with Braak staging. INTERPRETATION: These observations provide cellular evidence to support the hypothesis that dendritic spine plasticity is a mechanism of cognitive resilience that protects older individuals with AD pathology from developing dementia.

    "title": "Soluble Oligomers Require a Ganglioside to Trigger Neuronal Calcium Overload.",
    "abstract": "An altered distribution of membrane gangliosides (GM), including GM1, has recently been reported in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Moreover, amyloid-positive synaptosomes obtained from AD brains were found to contain high-density GM1 clusters, suggesting a pathological significance of GM1 increase at presynaptic neuritic terminals in AD. Here, we show that membrane GM1 specifically recruits small soluble oligomers of the 42-residue form of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta42), with intracellular flux of Ca2+ ions in primary rat hippocampal neurons and in human neuroblastoma cells. Specific membrane proteins appear to be involved in the early and transient influx of Ca2+ ions induced by Abeta42 oligomers with high solvent-exposed hydrophobicity (A+), but not in the sustained late influx of the same oligomers and in that induced by Abeta42 oligomers with low solvent-exposed hydrophobicity (A-) in GM1-enriched cells. In addition, A+ oligomers accumulate in proximity of membrane NMDA and AMPA receptors, inducing the early and transient Ca2+ influx, although FRET shows that the interaction is not direct. These results suggest that age-dependent clustering of GM1 within neuronal membranes could induce neurodegeneration in elderly people as a consequence of an increased ability of the lipid bilayers to recruit membrane-permeabilizing oligomers. We also show that both lipid and protein components of the plasma membrane can contribute to neuronal dysfunction, thus expanding the molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in AD.",

In this study, we present different complicated brain pathologies determined postmortem of monozygotic GSS twin sisters. Case 1 showed cerebellar ataxia at the age of 58 years, and died at 66 years. Case 2 became symptomatic at the age of 75 years, and died at 79 years. There was a 17-year difference in the age of onset between the twins. Postmortem examination revealed numerous prion protein (PrP) plaques in the brains of both cases. The spongiform change and brain atrophy in case 1 were more severe compared with those in case 2. Western-blot analysis identified proteinase-resistant PrP (PrPres) at the molecular weight of 21-30 kDa and 8 kDa in the twins. Gel filtration revealed that PrPres was mainly composed of PrP oligomer. PrPres signal patterns were similar between the twins. Additionally, case 1 showed alpha-synucleinopathy and case 2 showed Alzheimer disease pathology. These different proteinopathies were involved in the amyloid plaque formations of both cases. The degree of GSS pathology was mainly related to disease duration. The amyloid plaque formations could be decorated by concomitant neuropathological changes such as alpha-synucleinopathy and tauopathy.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is one of the most devastating neurodegenerative diseases without effective therapies. Immunotherapy is a promising approach, but amyloid antibody structural information is limited. Here we simulate the recognition of monomeric, oligomeric, and fibril amyloid-beta (Abeta) by three homologous antibodies (solanezumab, crenezumab, and their chimera, CreneFab). Solanezumab only binds the monomer, whereas crenezumab and CreneFab can recognize different oligomerization states; however, the structural basis for this observation is not understood. We successfully identified stable complexes of crenezumab with Abeta pentamer (oligomer model) and 16-mer (fibril model). It is noteworthy that solanezumab targets Abeta residues 16-26 preferentially in the monomeric state; conversely, crenezumab consistently targets residues 13-16 in different oligomeric states. Unlike the buried monomeric peptide in solanezumab's complementarity-determining region, crenezumab binds the oligomer's lateral and edge residues. Surprisingly, crenezumab's complementarity-determining region loops can effectively bind the Abeta fibril lateral surface around the same 13-16 region. The constant domain influences antigen recognition through entropy redistribution. Different constant domain residues in solanezumab/crenezumab/chimera influence the binding of Abeta aggregates. Collectively, we provide molecular insight into the recognition mechanisms facilitating antibody design.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy targeting Abeta42 is drawing attention as a possible therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Considering the significance of reported oligomerized Abeta42 species, selective targeting of the oligomer will increase the therapeutic efficacy. However, what kinds of oligomers are suitable targets for immunotherapy remains unclear. We previously identified a toxic conformer of Abeta42, which has a turn structure at 22-23 (\"toxic turn\"), among Abeta42 conformations. This toxic conformer of Abeta42 has been reported to show rapid oligomerization and to exhibit strong neurotoxicity and synaptotoxicity. We recently developed a monoclonal antibody against the toxic conformer (24B3), which demonstrated the increase of the toxic conformer in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients, indicating its accumulation in AD patients' brains. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of 24B3 targeting the toxic conformer in AD model mice. The intraperitoneal administration of 24B3 for 3 months improved cognitive impairment and reduced the toxic conformer levels. Notably, this treatment did not reduce the number of senile plaques. Furthermore, the single intravenous administration of 24B3 suppressed the memory deficit in AD mice. These results suggest that the toxic conformer of Abeta42 with a turn at 22-23 represents one of the promising therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal chemical imaging using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) can provide comprehensive molecular information in situ within the same tissue sections. This is of relevance for studying different brain pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), where recent data suggest a critical relevance of colocalizing Abeta peptides and neuronal lipids. We here developed a novel trimodal, high-resolution (10 mum) MALDI imaging MS (IMS) paradigm for negative and positive ion mode lipid analysis and subsequent protein ion imaging on the same tissue section. Matrix sublimation of 1,5-diaminonaphthalene (1,5-DAN) enabled dual polarity lipid MALDI IMS on the same pixel points at high spatial resolutions (10 mum) and with high spectral quality. This was followed by 10 mum resolution protein imaging on the same measurement area, which allowed correlation of lipid signals with protein distribution patterns within distinct cerebellar regions in mouse brain. The demonstrated trimodal imaging strategy (IMS3) was further shown to be an efficient approach for simultaneously probing Abeta plaque-associated lipids and Abeta peptides within the hippocampus of 18 month-old transgenic AD mice (tgArcSwe). Here, IMS3 revealed a strong colocalization of distinct lipid species including ceramides, phosphatidylinositols, sulfatides (Cer 18:0, PI 38:4, ST 24:0) and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC 16:0, LPC 18:0) with plaque-associated Abeta isoforms (Abeta 1-37, Abeta 1-38, Abeta 1-40). This highlights the potential of IMS3 as an alternative, superior approach to consecutively performed immuno-based Abeta staining strategies. Furthermore, the IMS3 workflow allowed for multimodal in situ MS/MS analysis of both lipids and Abeta peptides. Altogether, the here presented IMS3 approach shows great potential for comprehensive, high-resolution molecular analysis of histological features at cellular length scales with high chemical specificity. It therefore represents a powerful approach for probing the complex molecular pathology of, e.g., neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by neurotoxic protein aggregation.",

We identified a specific apolipoprotein E (APOE)-dependent molecular signature in microglia from models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in microglia surrounding neuritic beta-amyloid (Abeta)-plaques in the brains of people with AD. The APOE pathway mediated a switch from a homeostatic to a neurodegenerative microglia phenotype after phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons. TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) induced APOE signaling, and targeting the TREM2-APOE pathway restored the homeostatic signature of microglia in ALS and AD mouse models and prevented neuronal loss in an acute model of neurodegeneration. APOE-mediated neurodegenerative microglia had lost their tolerogenic function. Our work identifies the TREM2-APOE pathway as a major regulator of microglial functional phenotype in neurodegenerative diseases and serves as a novel target that could aid in the restoration of homeostatic microglia.",

    "title": "Asparagine and glutamine ladders promote cross-species prion conversion.",
    "abstract": "Prion transmission between species is governed in part by primary sequence similarity between the infectious prion aggregate, PrPSc, and the cellular prion protein of the host, PrPC A puzzling feature of prion formation is that certain PrPC sequences, such as that of bank vole, can be converted by a remarkably broad array of different mammalian prions, whereas others, such as rabbit, show robust resistance to cross-species prion conversion. To examine the structural determinants that confer susceptibility or resistance to prion conversion, we systematically tested over 40 PrPC variants of susceptible and resistant PrPC sequences in a prion conversion assay. Five key residue positions markedly impacted prion conversion, four of which were in steric zipper segments where side chains from amino acids tightly interdigitate in a dry interface. Strikingly, all five residue substitutions modulating prion conversion involved the gain or loss of an asparagine or glutamine residue. For two of the four positions, Asn and Gln residues were not interchangeable, revealing a strict requirement for either an Asn or Gln residue. Bank voles have a high number of Asn and Gln residues and a high Asn:Gln ratio. These findings suggest that a high number of Asn and Gln residues at specific positions may stabilize beta-sheets and lower the energy barrier for cross-species prion transmission, potentially because of hydrogen bond networks from side chain amides forming extended Asn/Gln ladders. These data also suggest that multiple PrPC segments containing Asn/Gln residues may act in concert along a replicative interface to promote prion conversion.",

    "title": "Inhibition of PDE2 reverses beta amyloid induced memory impairment through regulation of PKA/PKG-dependent neuro-inflammatory and apoptotic pathways.",
    "abstract": "Beta amyloid peptides (Abeta) are known risk factors involved in cognitive impairment, neuroinflammatory and apoptotic processes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Phosphodiesterase 2 (PDE2) inhibitors increase the intracellular cAMP and/or cGMP activities, which may ameliorate cognitive deficits associated with AD. However, it remains unclear whether PDE2 mediated neuroapoptotic and neuroinflammatory events, as well as cognitive performance in AD are related to cAMP/cGMP-dependent pathways. The present study investigated how the selective PDE2 inhibitor BAY60-7550 (BAY) affected Abeta-induced learning and memory impairment in two classic rodent models. IL-22 and IL-17, Bax and Bcl-2, PKA/PKG and the brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) levels in hippocampus and cortex were detected with immunoblotting assay. The results showed that BAY reversed Abeta-induced cognitive impairment as shown in the water maze test and step-down test. Moreover, BAY treatment reversed the Abeta-induced changes in IL-22 and IL-17 and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. Changes in cAMP/cGMP levels, PKA/PKG and BDNF expression were also prevented by BAY. These effects of BAY on memory performance and related neurochemical changes were partially blocked by the PKG inhibitor KT 5823. These findings indicated that the protective effects of BAY against Abeta-induced memory deficits might involve the regulation of neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptotic events.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. It is the most common form of human cognitive decline and dementia. In this study, we aim to systematically investigate the ameliorative effects of dopamine D1-like receptor agonist SKF38393 on cognitive dysfunction and explore its underlying mechanisms. The Abeta1-42 was injected intracerebroventricularly to establish cognitive disorder model. Then, a series of behavior tests were used. In order to further study the mechanisms, some relevant protein was assessed by ELISA method and Western blot. The results in behavior tests revealed that SKF38393 significantly ameliorated all the test indexes compared with the model mice. Then SKF38393 increased phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and expression of Bcl-2 in Western blot analyses. Furthermore, in ELISA assay, SKF38393 significantly increased the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and reduced the beta-site APP cleaving enzyme1 (BACE1) and Abeta1-42 levels in hippocampus and cortex of mice. However, compared with SKF38393-H, all these results were significantly reversed by the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390. These results indicated that SKF38393 could ameliorate Abeta1-42-induced cognitive dysfunction in mice, which may be related to D1 receptor activation. It leads to the phosphorylation of CREB, which promote the expression of BDNF, Bcl-2 and decrease the expression of Abeta1-42 of mice. Our findings suggest that dopamine D1-like receptor may be a potential target for the treatment of AD and its agonists may become a novel drug in the future.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ferritin (reporting brain iron) is associated with longitudinal changes in CSF beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau. METHODS: Mixed-effects models of CSF Abeta1-42 and tau were constructed using data from 296 participants who had baseline measurement of CSF ferritin and annual measurement of CSF tau and Abeta1-42 for up to 5 years. RESULTS: In subjects with biomarker-confirmed Alzheimer's pathology, high CSF ferritin (>6.2 ng/mL) was associated with accelerated depreciation of CSF Abeta1-42 (reporting increased plaque formation; p=0.0001). CSF ferritin was neither associated with changes in CSF tau in the same subjects, nor longitudinal changes in CSF tau or Abeta1-42 in subjects with low baseline pathology. In simulation modelling of the natural history of Abeta deposition, which we estimated to occur over 31.4 years, we predicted that it would take 12.6 years to reach the pathology threshold value of CSF Abeta from healthy normal levels, and this interval is not affected by CSF ferritin. CSF ferritin influences the fall in CSF Abeta over the next phase, where high CSF ferritin accelerated the transition from threshold preclinical Abeta levels to the average level of Alzheimer's subjects from 18.8 to 10.8 years. CONCLUSIONS: Iron might facilitate Abeta deposition in Alzheimer's and accelerate the disease process.",

    "title": "Androgen alleviates neurotoxicity of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) by promoting microglial clearance of Abeta and inhibiting microglial inflammatory response to Abeta.",
    "abstract": "AIMS: Lower androgen level in elderly men is a risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been reported that androgen reduces amyloid peptides (Abeta) production and increases Abeta degradation by neurons. Activated microglia are involved in AD by either clearing Abeta deposits through uptake of Abeta or releasing cytotoxic substances and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here, we investigated the effect of androgen on Abeta uptake and clearance and Abeta-induced inflammatory response in microglia, on neuronal death induced by Abeta-activated microglia, and explored underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Intracellular and extracellular Abeta were examined by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot. Amyloid peptides (Abeta) receptors, Abeta degrading enzymes, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected by RT-PCR, real-time PCR, and ELISA. Phosphorylation of MAP kinases and NF-kappaB was examined by Western blot. RESULTS: We found that physiological concentrations of androgen enhanced Abeta42 uptake and clearance, suppressed Abeta42 -induced IL-1beta and TNFalpha expression by murine microglia cell line N9 and primary microglia, and alleviated neuronal death induced by Abeta42 -activated microglia. Androgen administration also reduced Abeta42 -induced IL-1beta expression and neuronal death in murine hippocampus. Mechanistic studies revealed that androgen promoted microglia to phagocytose and degrade Abeta42 through upregulating formyl peptide receptor 2 and endothelin-converting enzyme 1c expression, and inhibited Abeta42 -induced pro-inflammatory cytokines expression via suppressing MAPK p38 and NF-kappaB activation by Abeta42 , in an androgen receptor independent manner. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that androgen promotes microglia to phagocytose and clear Abeta42 and inhibits Abeta42 -induced inflammatory response, which may play an important role in reducing the neurotoxicity of Abeta.",

ApoA-I-Milano (M) is a mutated variant, which showed increased vasoprotective properties compared to ApoA-I-wild type in models of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular damage. We speculated that ApoA-I-M may also protect Abeta-affected vasculature and reverse some of the pathological features associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). For this purpose, we produced and characterized human recombinant ApoA-I-wild type and ApoA-I-M proteins. Both of them were able to avoid the aggregation of Abeta in vitro, even though recombinant ApoA-I-M was significantly more effective in protecting endothelial cells from Abeta(1-42)-toxicity. Next, we determined the effect of chronic intravenous administration of rApoA-I-M in the APP23-transgenic mouse model of AD. We found reduced cerebral Abeta levels in mice that received rApoA-I-M, which were accompanied by a lower expression of astrocyte and microglia neuroinflammatory markers. Our results suggest an applicability of this molecule as a therapeutic candidate for protecting the brain in AD.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: By 2050 it is projected that 115 million people worldwide will have Alzheimer's Disease (AD) [1]. Recent attempts have been made to redefine the diagnostic criteria of AD to include markers of neurodegeneration - measurable by FDG-PET - and markers of amyloid accumulation - measurable by amyloid-PET. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed to examine the current diagnostic use of amyloid and FDG PET. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and the Cochrane Database were searched for relevant papers RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: This search resulted in twenty-nine papers on amyloid imaging, twenty-three papers on FDG-PET and eight papers which utilized both techniques. Both modalities are considered in turn with regards to their diagnostic accuracy, their role in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and prognostication, their use in the differential diagnosis of AD and their clinical application. As evidenced from the current literature, both amyloid and FDG-PET meet criteria for suitable biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD. They both indicate pathophysiological processes, albeit at different stages of the Alzheimer's process, and are distinct from normal patterns of aging. CONCLUSION: Both techniques have been shown to detect AD with high sensitivity and specificity compared to other neurodegenerative processes and cognitively normal age-matched individuals. However, future studies with standardised, uniform thresholds and a lengthier longitudinal follow-up need to be conducted to allow us to make surer conclusions about the future role of PET in clinical practice. In addition, comparison with post-mortem diagnosis, rather than clinical diagnosis with its acknowledged flaws, would result in more powerful statistical outcomes - which is becoming increasingly important given that several disease-modifying AD drugs are now in phase 3 trials.",

METHODS: Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were constructed using previously identified 21 genome-wide significant loci for LOAD risk. RESULTS: We found that there is an overlap in the genetic architecture among sEOAD, fLOAD, and sLOAD. The highest association of the PRS and risk (odds ratio [OR] = 2.27; P = 1.29 x 10-7) was observed in sEOAD, followed by fLOAD (OR = 1.75; P = 1.12 x 10-7) and sLOAD (OR = 1.40; P = 1.21 x 10-3). The PRS was associated with cerebrospinal fluid ptau181-Abeta42 on eADAD (P = 4.36 x 10-2). CONCLUSION: Our analysis confirms that the genetic factors identified for LOAD modulate risk in sLOAD and fLOAD and also sEOAD cohorts. Specifically, our results suggest that the burden of these risk variants is associated with familial clustering and earlier onset of AD. Although these variants are not associated with risk in the eADAD, they may be modulating age at onset.",

    "abstract": "Many infections and stress signals can rapidly activate the NLRP3 inflammasome to elicit robust inflammatory responses. This activation requires a priming step, which is thought to be mainly for upregulating NLRP3 transcription. However, recent studies report that the NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated independently of transcription, suggesting that the priming process has unknown essential regulatory steps. Here, we report that JNK1-mediated NLRP3 phosphorylation at S194 is a critical priming event and is essential for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We show that NLRP3 inflammasome activation is disrupted in NLRP3-S194A knockin mice. JNK1-mediated NLRP3 S194 phosphorylation is critical for NLRP3 deubiquitination and facilitates its self-association and the subsequent inflammasome assembly. Importantly, we demonstrate that blocking S194 phosphorylation prevents NLRP3 inflammasome activation in cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). Thus, our study reveals a key priming molecular event that is a prerequisite for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Inhibiting NLRP3 phosphorylation could be an effective treatment for NLRP3-related diseases.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease suggests that synaptic degeneration and pathology is caused by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Subsequently, soluble Abeta oligomers cause the loss of synaptic proteins from neurons, a histopathological feature of Alzheimer's disease that correlates with the degree of dementia. In this study, the production of toxic forms of Abeta was examined in vitro using 7PA2 cells stably transfected with human APP. We show that conditioned media from 7PA2 cells containing Abeta oligomers caused synapse degeneration as measured by the loss of synaptic proteins, including synaptophysin and cysteine-string protein, from cultured neurons. Critically, conditioned media from 7PA2 cells treated with valproic acid (2-propylpentanoic acid (VPA)) or propylisopropylacetic acid (PIA) did not cause synapse damage. Treatment with VPA or PIA did not significantly affect total Abeta42 concentrations; rather these drugs selectively reduced the concentrations of Abeta42 oligomers in conditioned media. In contrast, treatment significantly increased the concentrations of Abeta42 monomers in conditioned media. VPA or PIA treatment reduced the concentrations of APP within lipid rafts, membrane compartments associated with Abeta production. These effects of VPA and PIA were reversed by the addition of platelet-activating factor, a bioactive phospholipid produced following activation of phospholipase A2, an enzyme sensitive to VPA and PIA. Collectively these data suggest that VPA and PIA reduce Abeta oligomers through inhibition of phospholipase A2 and suggest a novel therapeutic approach to Alzheimer's treatment.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Plasma amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides have been previously studied as candidate biomarkers to increase recruitment efficiency in secondary prevention clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Free and total Abeta42/40 plasma ratios (FP42/40 and TP42/40, respectively) were determined using ABtest assays in cognitively normal subjects from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle Flagship Study. This population was followed-up for 72 months and their cortical Abeta burden was assessed with positron emission tomography. RESULTS: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses showed an inverse association of Abeta42/40 plasma ratios and cortical Abeta burden. Optimized as a screening tool, TP42/40 reached 81% positive predictive value of high cortical Abeta burden, which represents 110% increase over the population prevalence of cortical Abeta positivity. DISCUSSION: These findings support the use of plasma Abeta42/40 ratios as surrogate biomarkers of cortical Abeta deposition and enrichment tools, reducing the number of subjects submitted to invasive tests and, consequently, recruitment costs in clinical trials targeting cognitively normal individuals.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder leading to dementia caused by advanced neuronal dysfunction and death. The most significant symptoms of AD are observed at late stages of the disease when interventions are most likely too late to ameliorate the condition. Currently, the predominant theory for AD is the \"amyloid hypothesis,\" which states that abnormally increased levels of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides result in the production of a variety of aggregates that are neurotoxic. The specific mechanisms for Abeta peptide-induced cytotoxicity have not yet been completely elucidated. However, since the majority of Abeta is released into the extracellular milieu, it is reasonable to assume that toxicity begins outside the cells and makes its way inside where it disrupts the basic cellular process resulting in cell death. There is increasing evidence that hsp, particularly Hsp70, are exported into the extracellular milieu by an active export mechanism independent of cell death. Therefore, both Abeta peptides and Hsp70 may coexist in a common environment during pathological conditions. We observed that Hsp70 affected the Abeta assembling process in vitro preventing oligomer formation. Moreover, the presence of Hsp70 reduced the Abeta peptide-induced toxicity of cultured neurons (N2A cells). These results suggest a potential mechanism for the reduction of the detrimental effects of Abeta peptides in AD.",

    "abstract": "The exact physiological function of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) in endothelial cells is unknown. Endothelium-specific APP-deficient (eAPP-/-) mice were created to gain new insights into the role of APP in the control of vascular endothelial function. Endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were significantly impaired in basilar arteries of global APP knockout (APP-/-) and eAPP-/- mice ( P < 0.05). In contrast, endothelium-independent relaxations to nitric oxide (NO)-donor diethylamine-NONOate were unchanged. Western blot analysis revealed that protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was significantly downregulated in large cerebral arteries of APP-/- mice and eAPP-/- mice as compared to respective wild-type littermates ( P < 0.05). Furthermore, basal levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were also significantly reduced in large cerebral arteries of APP-deficient mice ( P < 0.05). In contrast, protein expression of prostacyclin synthase as well as levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) was not affected by genetic inactivation of APP in endothelial cells. By using siRNA to knockdown APP in cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells we also found a significant downregulation of eNOS mRNA and protein expressions in APP-deficient endothelium ( P < 0.05). These findings indicate that under physiological conditions, expression of APP in cerebral vascular endothelium plays an important protective function by maintaining constitutive expression of eNOS .",

We investigated whether deferoxamine (DFX) treatment promotes functional recovery and tissue repair in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice. Twelve-month-old APP/PS1 mice were randomly divided into two groups (APP/PS1 and DFX). Neurological deficits were monitored for 2weeks following DFX treatment. To characterize the activation of the microglia, expression of the M1 and M2 phenotypes was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Moreover, deposition of iron and Abeta, as well as apoptosis, were examined, and a behavioral test was performed. DFX significantly ameliorated cognitive function and deposition of Abeta as well as inhibited apoptosis in the brain. Consistent with these observations, DFX induced M2 activation of microglia and inhibited M1 activation of microglia in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. In conclusion, DFX treatment improved functional recovery of AD mice, and the mechanism may involve DFX-induced M2 activation of microglia.",

    "abstract": "Synaptopathy underlying memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly thought to be instigated by toxic oligomers of the amyloid beta peptide (AbetaOs). Given the long latency and incomplete penetrance of AD dementia with respect to Abeta pathology, we hypothesized that factors present in the CNS may physiologically protect neurons from the deleterious impact of AbetaOs. Here we employed physically separated neuron-astrocyte cocultures to investigate potential non-cell autonomous neuroprotective factors influencing AbetaO toxicity. Neurons cultivated in the absence of an astrocyte feeder layer showed abundant AbetaO binding to dendritic processes and associated synapse deterioration. In contrast, neurons in the presence of astrocytes showed markedly reduced AbetaO binding and synaptopathy. Results identified the protective factors released by astrocytes as insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1). The protective mechanism involved release of newly bound AbetaOs into the extracellular medium dependent upon trafficking that was sensitive to exosome pathway inhibitors. Delaying insulin treatment led to AbetaO binding that was no longer releasable. The neuroprotective potential of astrocytes was itself sensitive to chronic AbetaO exposure, which reduced insulin/IGF1 expression. Our findings support the idea that physiological protection against synaptotoxic AbetaOs can be mediated by astrocyte-derived insulin/IGF1, but that this protection itself is vulnerable to AbetaO buildup.",

FE65 is a brain-enriched phospho-adaptor protein that interacts with APP and has been shown to modulate APP processing. However, the mechanism(s) that FE65 alters APP processing is still not fully understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that FE65 is phosphorylated at threonine 579 (T579) by glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta). Moreover, FE65 T579 phosphorylation potentiates gamma- and beta-secretases-mediated APP processing and Abeta liberation. Additionally, the phosphorylation suppresses FE65 PTB2 intermolecular dimerization but enhances FE65/APP complex formation. Hence, our findings reveal a novel mechanism that GSK3beta stimulates amyloidogenic processing of APP by phosphorylation of FE65 at T579.",

Among the anti-Abeta therapeutic approaches, the most extensively developed is immunotherapy-specifically, passive immunization through administration of exogenous monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Although testing of mAbs has been fraught with failure and confusing results, the experience gained from these trials has provided important clues for better treatments. This review summarizes the experience to date with anti-Abeta mAbs to enter clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and examines the evidence for clinical efficacy and the major problems with safety-i.e., amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. As mAbs differ considerably with regard to their epitopes and the conformations of Abeta that they recognize (monomers, oligomers, protofibrils, fibrils), the consequences of targeting different species are also considered. An often-cited explanation for the failure of anti-Abeta mAb trials is that they are set too late in the disease process. New trials are indeed evaluating treatments at prodromal and preclinical stages. We should expect to see additional studies of presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease to join the ongoing prevention trials, for which mAbs continue to serve as the mainstay.",

    "title": "Adult-Onset Epilepsy in Presymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease: A Retrospective Study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of epilepsy with onset in adulthood increases with age, mainly due to the accumulation of brain damage. However, a significant proportion of patients experience seizures of unknown cause. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with an increased risk of seizures. Seizure activity is interpreted as a secondary event related to hyperexcitability caused by amyloid-beta aggregation. OBJECTIVE: Since neurodegenerative processes begin several years before clinical symptoms, epilepsy could be more frequent in the presymptomatic stages of dementia. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the prevalence of epilepsy of unknown origin with adult onset before cognitive decline in a large cohort of AD patients (EPS-AD) recruited based on clinical and neuropsychological data. Data of patients with epilepsy followed by AD were compared with two control groups: patients with AD without seizures (no EPS-AD) and a large reference population (RP). RESULTS: In AD patients, the prevalence of epilepsy of unknown origin, with onset in the adulthood before cognitive decline is 17.1 times higher compared with the RP (95% CI: 10.3-28.3). In EPS-AD, seizures begin on average 4.6 years (median 2.0) before the onset of cognitive symptoms and cognitive decline starts 3.6 years earlier compared with noEPS-AD. CONCLUSIONS: Neurodegenerative processes of dementia could play a key role in the pathogenesis of epilepsy in a subgroup of individuals intended to develop cognitive decline. Adult-onset epilepsy of undefined cause could thus represent a risk factor for the ongoing neurodegenerative damage, even preceding by years the onset of clinical symptoms of dementia.",

    "abstract": "Primary progressive aphasia is a syndrome characterized by progressive loss of language abilities with three main phenotypic clinical presentations, including logopenic, non-fluent/agrammatic, and semantic variants. Previous imaging studies have shown unique anatomic impacts within language networks in each variant. However, direct measures of spontaneous neuronal activity and functional integrity of these impacted neural networks in primary progressive aphasia are lacking. The aim of this study was to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of resting state neuronal synchronizations in primary progressive aphasia syndromes. We hypothesized that resting state brain oscillations will show unique deficits within language network in each variant of primary progressive aphasia. We examined 39 patients with primary progressive aphasia including logopenic variant (n = 14, age = 61 +- 9 years), non-fluent/agrammatic variant (n = 12, age = 71 +- 8 years) and semantic variant (n = 13, age = 65 +- 7 years) using magnetoencephalographic imaging, compared to a control group that was matched in age and gender to each primary progressive aphasia subgroup (n = 20, age = 65 +- 5 years). Each patient underwent a complete clinical evaluation including a comprehensive battery of language tests. We examined the whole-brain resting state functional connectivity as measured by imaginary coherence in each patient group compared to the control cohort, in three frequency oscillation bands-delta-theta (2-8 Hz); alpha (8-12 Hz); beta (12-30 Hz). Each variant showed a distinct spatiotemporal pattern of altered functional connectivity compared to age-matched controls. Specifically, we found significant hyposynchrony of alpha and beta frequency within the left posterior temporal and occipital cortices in patients with the logopenic variant, within the left inferior frontal cortex in patients with the non-fluent/agrammatic variant, and within the left temporo-parietal junction in patients with the semantic variant. Patients with logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia also showed significant hypersynchrony of delta-theta frequency within bilateral medial frontal and posterior parietal cortices. Furthermore, region of interest-based analyses comparing the spatiotemporal patterns of variant-specific regions of interest identified in comparison to age-matched controls showed significant differences between primary progressive aphasia variants themselves. We also found distinct patterns of regional spectral power changes in each primary progressive aphasia variant, compared to age-matched controls. Our results demonstrate neurophysiological signatures of network-specific neuronal dysfunction in primary progressive aphasia variants. The unique spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal synchrony signify diverse neurophysiological disruptions and pathological underpinnings of the language network in each variant.",

    "abstract": "Although amyloid assembly in vitro is commonly investigated using single protein sequences, fibril formation in vivo can be more heterogeneous, involving co-assembly of proteins of different length, sequence and/or post-translational modifications. Emerging evidence suggests that co-polymerization can alter the rate and/or mechanism of aggregation and can contribute to pathogenicity. Electrospray ionization-ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (ESI-IMS-MS) is uniquely suited to the study of these heterogeneous ensembles. Here, ESI-IMS-MS combined with analysis of fibrillation rates using thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, is used to track the course of aggregation of variants of islet-amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) in isolation and in pairwise mixtures. We identify a sub-population of extended monomers as the key precursors of amyloid assembly, and reveal that the fastest aggregating sequence in peptide mixtures determines the lag time of fibrillation, despite being unable to cross-seed polymerization. The results demonstrate that co-polymerization of IAPP sequences radically alters the rate of amyloid assembly by altering the conformational properties of the mixed oligomers that form.",

    "title": "Elucidating the 3D structures of Al(iii)-Abeta complexes: a template free strategy based on the pre-organization hypothesis.",
    "abstract": "Senile plaques are extracellular deposits found in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and are mainly formed by insoluble fibrils of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides. The mechanistic details about how AD develops are not fully understood yet, but metals such as Cu, Zn, or Fe are proposed to have a non-innocent role. Many studies have also linked the non biological metal aluminum with AD, a species whose concentration in the environment and food has been constantly increasing since the industrial revolution. Gaining a molecular picture of how Al(iii) interacts with an Abeta peptide is of fundamental interest to improve understanding of the many variables in the evolution of AD. So far, no consensus has been reached on how this metal interacts with Abeta, partially due to the experimental complexity of detecting and quantifying the resulting Al(iii)-Abeta complexes. Computational chemistry arises as a powerful alternative to investigate how Al(iii) can interact with Abeta peptides, as suitable strategies could shed light on the metal-peptide description at the molecular level. However, the absence of any reliable template that could be used for the modeling of the metallopeptide structure makes computational insight extremely difficult. Here, we present a novel strategy to generate accurate 3D models of the Al(iii)-Abeta complexes, which still circumvents first principles simulations of metal binding to peptides of Abeta. The key to this approach lies in the identification of experimental structures of the isolated peptide that are favourably pre-organized for the binding of a given metal in configurations of the first coordination sphere that were previously identified as the most stable with amino acid models. This approach solves the problem of the absence of clear structural templates for novel metallopeptide constructs. The posterior refinement of the structures via QM/MM and MD calculations allows us to provide, for the first time, physically sound models for Al(iii)-Abeta complexes with a 1 : 1 stoichiometry, where up to three carboxylic groups are involved in the metal binding, with a clear preference towards Glu3, Asp7, and Glu11.",

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) control and regulate many protein functions and cellular pathways, and PTMs of mutant Htt are likely important modulators of HD pathogenesis. Alterations of selected numbers of PTMs of Htt fragments have been shown to modulate Htt cellular localization and toxicity. In this study, we systematically introduced site-directed alterations in individual phosphorylation and acetylation sites in full-length Htt constructs. The effects of each of these PTM alteration constructs were tested on cell toxicity using our nuclear condensation assay and on mitochondrial viability by measuring mitochondrial potential and size. Using these functional assays in primary neurons, we identified several PTMs whose alteration can block neuronal toxicity and prevent potential loss and swelling of the mitochondria caused by mutant Htt. These PTMs included previously described sites such as serine 116 and newly found sites such as serine 2652 throughout the protein. We found that these functionally relevant sites are clustered in protease-sensitive domains throughout full-length Htt. These findings advance our understanding of the Htt PTM code and its role in HD pathogenesis. Because PTMs are catalyzed by enzymes, the toxicity-modulating Htt PTMs identified here may be promising therapeutic targets for managing HD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder among the elderly. During the progression of AD, massive neuronal degeneration occurs in the late stage of the disease; however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this neuronal loss remain unknown. AbetapE3-42 (an N-terminal-truncated amyloid-beta peptide that begins with pyroglutamate at the third position) is produced during late-stage AD. It also aggregates more rapidly in vitro and exhibits greater toxicity in neurons than full-length Abeta1-42. In the present study, we established a Drosophila melanogaster model that expresses Abeta3-42E3Q, which effectively produces AbetapE3-42, and investigated the function of AbetapE3-42 using the photoreceptor neurons of Drosophila. AbetapE3-42 induced caspase-dependent apoptosis and caused progressive degeneration in photoreceptor neurons. Mutations in ER stress response genes or the administration of an inhibitor of the ER stress response markedly suppressed the degeneration phenotype, suggesting that the ER stress response plays an important role in neurodegeneration caused by AbetapE3-42. We also confirmed that human Tau-dependent apoptotic induction was strongly enhanced by AbetapE3-42. Thus, AbetapE3-42 expression system in the fly may be a promising new tool for studying late-onset neurodegeneration in AD.",

Design, Setting, and Participants: This imaging substudy of the Harvard Aging Brain Study included 133 clinically healthy older participants (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale global scores of 0) participating in the Harvard Aging Brain Study who underwent cross-sectional flortaucipir F 18 (previously known as AV 1451, T807) positron emission tomography (FTP-PET) imaging for tau and Pittsburgh compound B carbon 11-labeled PET (PiB-PET) imaging for Abeta. The following 2 regions for tau burden were identified: the entorhinal cortex, which exhibits early signs of tauopathy, and the inferior temporal region, which is more closely associated with AD-related pathologic mechanisms. Data were collected from June 11, 2012, through April 7, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: Subjective cognitive decline was measured using a previously published method of z-transforming subscales from the Memory Functioning Questionnaire, the Everyday Cognition battery, and a 7-item questionnaire. The Abeta level was measured according to a summary distribution volume ratio of frontal, lateral temporal and parietal, and retrosplenial PiB-PET tracer uptake. The FTP-PET measures were computed as standardized uptake value ratios. Linear regression models focused on main and interactive effects of Abeta, entorhinal cortical, and inferior temporal tau on SCD, controlling for age, sex, educational attainment, and Geriatric Depression Scale score. Results: Of the 133 participants, 75 (56.3%) were women and 58 (43.6%) were men; mean (SD) age was 76 (6.9) years (range, 55-90 years). Thirty-nine participants (29.3%) exhibited a high Abeta burden. Greater SCD was associated with increasing entorhinal cortical tau burden (beta = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.19-.52; P < .001) and Abeta burden (beta = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.08-.40; P = .005), but not inferior temporal tau burden (beta = 0.10; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.28; P = .27). This association between entorhinal cortical tau burden and SCD was largely unchanged after accounting for Abeta burden (beta = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15-.58; P = .001), and no interaction influenced SCD (beta = -0.36; 95% CI, -0.34 to 0.09; P = .25). An exploratory post hoc whole-brain analysis also indicated that SCD was predominantly associated with greater tau burden in the entorhinal cortex. Conclusions and Relevance: Subjective cognitive decline is indicative of accumulation of early tauopathy in the medial temporal lobe, specifically in the entorhinal cortex, and to a lesser extent, elevated global levels of Abeta. Our findings suggest multiple underlying pathways that motivate SCD that do not necessarily interact to influence SCD endorsement. As such, multiple biological factors must be considered when assessing SCD in clinically healthy older adults.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small vesicles released by cells to aid cell-cell communication and tissue homeostasis. Human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is the major component of amyloid deposits found in pancreatic islets of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). IAPP is secreted in conjunction with insulin from pancreatic beta cells to regulate glucose metabolism. Here, using a combination of analytical and biophysical methods in vitro, we tested whether EVs isolated from pancreatic islets of healthy patients and patients with T2D modulate IAPP amyloid formation. We discovered that pancreatic EVs from healthy patients reduce IAPP amyloid formation by peptide scavenging, but T2D pancreatic and human serum EVs have no effect. In accordance with these differential effects, the insulin:C-peptide ratio and lipid composition differ between EVs from healthy pancreas and EVs from T2D pancreas and serum. It appears that healthy pancreatic EVs limit IAPP amyloid formation via direct binding as a tissue-specific control mechanism.",

We used an unbiased D-amino acid substitution strategy to determine structure-assembly relationships of 76 different Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptides. We determined the effects of the substitutions on peptide oligomerization, secondary structure dynamics, fibril assembly dynamics, and fibril morphology. Our experiments revealed that the assembly of Abeta42 was more sensitive to chiral substitutions than was Abeta40 assembly. Substitutions at identical positions in the two peptides often, but not always, produced the same effects on assembly. Sites causing substantial effects in both Abeta40 and Abeta42 include His14, Gln15, Ala30, Ile31, Met35, and Val36. Sites whose effects were unique to Abeta40 include Lys16, Leu17, and Asn 27, whereas sites unique to Abeta42 include Phe20 and Ala21.

Elimination of Abeta oligomers or inhibition of Abeta assembly is a valuable therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD. Here, we obtained a mimotope of Abeta oligomers, AOEP2, by screening a peptide library using oligomer-specific antibodies. The antibodies induced by AOEP2 specifically recognize Abeta oligomers rather than monomers and fibrils. Interestingly, the AOEP2 peptide binds to Abeta monomers and inhibits the formation of Abeta oligomers and beta-sheet structure, reduces Abeta42-induced neurotoxicity, and decreases the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Taken together, AOEP2, a novel multifunctional peptide directly or indirectly targeting Abeta, has promising therapeutic potential for AD.",

    "title": "Edaravone Attenuates the Proinflammatory Response in Amyloid-beta-Treated Microglia by Inhibiting NLRP3 Inflammasome-Mediated IL-1beta Secretion.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Microglial activation is an important pathological feature in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides play a crucial role in microglial activation. In addition, edaravone (EDA) was recently shown to suppress oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokine production in APPswePS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. However, the mechanism by which EDA inhibits the Abeta-induced proinflammatory response in microglia is poorly understood. METHODS: The mitochondrial membrane potential ( psim) was evaluated using JC-1 staining. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial ROS levels were detected using CM-H2DCFDA and MitoSOXTM Red, respectively. The levels of CD11b, NLRP3, pro-caspase-1 and manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD-2) were observed by western blotting, and the levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in culture supernatants were quantified using an ELISA kit. RESULTS: Abeta induced microglia activation and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction was associated with ROS accumulation and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Importantly, Abeta induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to caspase-1 activation and IL-1beta release in microglia. Moreover, EDA obviously attenuated the depolarization of  psim, reduced mitochondria-derived ROS production and increased SOD-2 activity, resulting in the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1beta secretion in Abeta-treated microglia. CONCLUSION: EDA is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects on Abeta-treated microglia.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease, a common neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by the aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. The interactions of Abeta with membranes cause changes in membrane morphology and ion permeation, which are responsible for its neurotoxicity and can accelerate fibril growth. However, the Abeta-lipid interactions and how these induce membrane perturbation and disruption at the atomic level and the consequences for the Abeta organization are not entirely understood. Here, we perform multiple atomistic molecular dynamics simulations on three protofibrillar Abeta9-40 trimers. Our simulations show that, regardless of the morphologies and the initial orientations of the three different protofibrillar Abeta9-40 trimers, the N-terminal beta-sheet of all trimers preferentially binds to the membrane surface. The POPG lipid bilayers enhance the structural stability of protofibrillar Abeta trimers by stabilizing inter-peptide beta-sheets and D23-K28 salt-bridges. The interaction causes local membrane thinning. We found that the trimer structure related to Alzheimer's disease brain tissue () is the most stable both in water solution and at membrane surface, and displays slightly stronger membrane perturbation capability. These results provide mechanistic insights into the membrane-enhanced structural stability of protofibrillar Abeta oligomers and the first step of Abeta-induced membrane disruption at the atomic level.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques consisting of Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) aggregates and neurofibrillary tangles formed by aggregation of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau. We generated a novel invertebrate model of AD by crossing Abeta1-42 (strain CL2355) with either pro-aggregating tau (strain BR5270) or anti-aggregating tau (strain BR5271) pan-neuronal expressing transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans. The lifespan and progeny viability of the double transgenic strains were significantly decreased compared with wild type N2 (P<0.0001). In addition, co-expression of these transgenes interfered with neurotransmitter signaling pathways, caused deficits in chemotaxis associative learning, increased protein aggregation visualized by Congo red staining, and increased neuronal loss. Global transcriptomic RNA-seq analysis revealed 248 up- and 805 down-regulated genes in N2 wild type versus Abeta1-42+pro-aggregating tau animals, compared to 293 up- and 295 down-regulated genes in N2 wild type versus Abeta1-42+anti-aggregating tau animals. Gene set enrichment analysis of Abeta1-42+pro-aggregating tau animals uncovered up-regulated annotation clusters UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (5 genes, P<4.2E-4), protein phosphorylation (5 genes, P<2.60E-02), and aging (5 genes, P<8.1E-2) while the down-regulated clusters included nematode cuticle collagen (36 genes, P<1.5E-21). RNA interference of 13 available top up-regulated genes in Abeta1-42+pro-aggregating tau animals revealed that F-box family genes and nep-4 could enhance life span deficits and chemotaxis deficits while Y39G8C.2 (TTBK2) could suppress these behaviors. Comparing the list of regulated genes from C. elegans to the top 60 genes related to human AD confirmed an overlap of 8 genes: patched homolog 1, PTCH1 (ptc-3), the Rab GTPase activating protein, TBC1D16 (tbc-16), the WD repeat and FYVE domain-containing protein 3, WDFY3 (wdfy-3), ADP-ribosylation factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2, ARFGEF2 (agef-1), Early B-cell Factor, EBF1 (unc-3), d-amino-acid oxidase, DAO (daao-1), glutamate receptor, metabotropic 1, GRM1 (mgl-2), prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 2, P4HA2 (dpy-18 and phy-2).

    "title": "Effects of Homocysteine on white matter diffusion parameters in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The clinical features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are related to brain network degeneration, and hyperhomocysteinemia is related to greater white matter hyperintensities. We investigated the changes in four diffusion tensor imaging parameters in the white matter of patients with early stage AD, examined their associations with homocysteine level, and tested the clinical significance of the diffusion tensor imaging parameters and homocysteine level in correlation analysis with cognitive test scores. METHODS: We enrolled 132 patients with AD and analyzed white matter (WM) macrostructural changes using diffusion tensor neuroimaging parameters including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusion (MD), axial diffusivity (axial-D) and radial diffusivity (RD). Two neuroimaging post-processing analyses were performed to provide complementary data. First, we calculated 11 major bundle microstructural integrities using a WM parcellation algorithm, and correlated them with serum homocysteine levels to explore whether the fiber bundles were affected by homocysteine. Second, we used tract-based spatial statistics to explore the anatomical regions associated with homocysteine levels. Changes in cognitive test scores caused by homocysteine served as the major outcome factor. RESULTS: The results suggested that homocysteine levels did not have a direct impact on cross-sectional cognitive test scores, but that they were inversely correlated with renal function, B12 and folate levels. Topographies showing independent correlations with homocysteine in FA and MD were more diffusely located compared to the posterior brain regions in axial-D and RD. In the association bundle analysis, homocysteine levels were significantly correlated with the four diffusion parameters even after correcting for confounders, however no association between homocysteine and WM to predict cognitive outcomes was established. CONCLUSIONS: In our patients with AD, homocysteine levels were associated with renal dysfunction and decreased levels of vitamin B12 and folate, all of which require clinical attention as they may have been associated with impaired WM microstructural integrity and modulated cognitive performance in cross-sectional observations.",

    "title": "Role of microglial amylin receptors in mediating beta amyloid (Abeta)-induced inflammation.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation in the brain consequent to activation of microglia is viewed as an important component of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Amyloid beta (Abeta) protein is known to activate microglia and unleash an inflammatory cascade that eventually results in neuronal dysfunction and death. In this study, we sought to identify the presence of amylin receptors on human fetal and murine microglia and determine whether Abeta activation of the inflammasome complex and subsequent release of cytokines is mediated through these receptors. METHODS: The presence of dimeric components of the amylin receptor (calcitonin receptor and receptor activity modifying protein 3) were first immunohistochemically identified on microglia. Purified human fetal microglial (HFM) cultures were incubated with an in vivo microglial marker, DyLight 594-conjugated tomato lectin, and loaded with the membrane-permeant green fluorescent dye, Fluo-8L-AM for measurements of intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i. HFM and BV-2 cells were primed with lipopolysaccharide and then exposed to either human amylin or soluble oligomeric Abeta1-42 prior to treatment with and without the amylin receptor antagonist, AC253. Changes in the inflammasome complex, NLRP3 and caspase-1, were examined in treated cell cultures with Western blot and fluorometric assays. RT-PCR measurements were performed to assess cytokine release. Finally, in vivo studies were performed in transgenic mouse model of AD (5xFAD) to examine the effects of systemic administration of AC253 on markers of neuroinflammation in the brain. RESULTS: Acute applications of human amylin or Abeta1-42 resulted in an increase in [Ca2+]i that could be blocked by the amylin receptor antagonist, AC253. Activation of the NLRP3 and caspase-1 and subsequent release of cytokines, TNFalpha and IL-1beta, was diminished by AC253 pretreatment of HFMs and BV2 cells. In vivo, intraperitoneal administration of AC253 resulted in a reduction in microglial markers (Iba-1 and CD68), caspase-1, TNFalpha, and IL-1beta. These reductions in inflammatory markers were accompanied by reduction in amyloid plaque and size in the brains of 5xFAD mice compared to controls. CONCLUSION: Microglial amylin receptors mediate Abeta-evoked inflammation, and amylin receptor antagonists therefore offer an attractive therapeutic target for intervention in AD.",

The QSAR analysis distinguished molecular lipophilicity as an important factor that contributes to the binding affinity. Principal component analysis was used in order to reveal similarities or dissimilarities among the studied compounds. The analysis of in silico absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) parameters was conducted. The ranking of the studied analogs on the basis of their ADMET parameters was done applying the sum of ranking differences, as a relatively new chemometric method. The main aim of the study was to reveal the most important molecular features whose changes lead to the changes in the binding affinities of the studied compounds. Another point of view on the binding affinity of the most promising analogs was established by application of molecular docking analysis. The results of the molecular docking were proven to be in agreement with the experimental outcome.",

Three coronal sections of a cerebral hemisphere were submitted to T2 and T2* MRI sequences. The amount of Fe deposition in the deep brain structures and the number of small cerebrovascular lesions was determined in ALS and the subtypes of FTLD compared to control brains, with neuropathological correlates. A significant increase of Fe deposition was observed in the claustrum, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, thalamus, and subthalamic nucleus of the FTLD-FUS and FTLD-TDP groups, while in the ALS one, the Fe increase was only observed in the caudate and the subthalamic nuclei. White matter changes were only significantly more severe in the FTLD compared to those in ALS and in controls brains. Cortical micro-bleeds were increased in the frontal and temporal lobes of FTLD as well as of ALS brains compared to controls. Cortical micro-infarcts were, on the other hand, more frequent in the control compared to the ALS and FTLD groups. The present study supports the assumption of a neuropathological continuity between ALS and FTLD and illustrates the favourable vascular risk profile in these diseases.",

Their structures were elucidated based on 1D and 2D-NMR spectra as well as HR-ESI-MS data. The absolute configurations of new compounds were assigned by comparing their experimental specific rotation or ECD curves with the calculated data. The inhibitory activity on Abeta aggregation was screened by ThT assay, and compounds 7 (70.7%), 9 (86.5%), 10 (88.4%), 15 (86.1%) and 16 (87.7%) showed outstanding inhibition rate at 20muM compared to the positive control, curcumin (65.64%). In addition, docking study was performed to initially examine possible molecular mechanisms. Considering the important role of oxidative stress in AD, all the isolated compounds were tested for their H2O2-induced damage in human neuronblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Among them, compound 16 (91.0%) was the most potent candidate in the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "The biological fate of amyloid beta (Abeta) species is a fundamental question in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. The competition between clearance and aggregation of Abetas is critical for the onset of AD. Copper has been widely considered to be an inducer of harmful crosslinking of Abetas, and an important triggering factor for the onset of AD. In this report, however, we present data to show that copper can also be an inducer of Abeta degradation in the presence of a large excess of well-known intrinsic (such as dopamine) or extrinsic (such as vitamin C) anti-oxidants. The degraded fragments were identified using SDS-Page gels, and validated via nanoLC-MS/MS. A tentative mechanism for the degradation was proposed and validated with model peptides. In addition, we performed electrophysiological analysis to investigate the synaptic functions in brain slices, and found that in the presence of a significant excess of vitamin C, Cu(ii) could prevent an Abeta-induced deficit in synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Collectively, our evidence strongly indicated that a proper combination of copper and anti-oxidants might have a positive effect on the prevention of AD. This double-edged function of copper in AD has been largely overlooked in the past. We believe that our report is very important for fully understanding the function of copper in AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a common cause of young onset dementia. Very few reports on disease duration are currently available and predictors of survival are still undefined. The aim of the present study was to assess the natural history of FTD and to define predictors of survival. METHODS: Four hundred amd eleven FTD patients, including 294 with behavioural variant FTD, 77 with agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and 40 with semantic variant PPA, were consecutively enrolled and demographic and clinical variables carefully recorded. Each patient underwent genetic screening for monogenic disease. RESULTS: The mean survival time from onset of the symptoms was 7.8 +- 4.0 years. The presence of a pathogenic mutation (GRN, C9orf72 or MAPT) (Hazard ratio [HR] = 1.85, 95% CI 1.04-3.31, p = 0.037) and older age at disease onset (HR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.07, p = 0.002) were associated with shorter life expectancy. However, a significant negative interaction between age at onset and genetic mutation was found, suggesting that the effect of age is different in patients with and without a genetic mutation (p = 0.028). Gender, clinical phenotype or education and occupation were not associated with survival risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that monogenic disease and age at onset are independent predictors of survival and should be considered in future clinical intervention trials and in patients' and caregivers' counselling.",

    "abstract": "The role of beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still considered crucial. The state of Abeta aggregation is critical in promoting neuronal loss and neuronal function impairment. Recently, we demonstrated that Acetylcholine (ACh) is neuroprotective against the toxic effects of Abeta in the cholinergic LAN-2 cells. In biophysical experiments, ACh promotes the soluble Abeta peptide conformation rather than the aggregation-prone beta-sheet conformation. In order to better understand the biological role of ACh in AD, we studied the effect of Abeta on the phosphorylation of the cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) in the TB neuroectodermal cell line, which differentiates toward a neuronal phenotype when cultured in the presence of retinoic acid (RA). We chose the phosphorylated form of cPLA2 (Ser505, Phospho-cPLA2) as a biomarker to test the influence of ACh on the effects of Abeta in both undifferentiated and RA-differentiated TB cells. Our results show that TB cells are responsive to Abeta. Moreover, in undifferentiated cells 1 h treatment with Abeta induces a 2.5-fold increase of the Phospho-cPLA2 level compared to the control after 24 h in vitro, while no significant difference is observed between Abeta-treated and non-treated cells after 4 and 7 days in vitro. The RA-differentiated cells are not sensitive to Abeta. In TB cell line ACh is able to blunt the effects of Abeta. The ability of ACh to protect non-cholinergic cells against Abeta reinforces the hypothesis that, in addition to its role in cholinergic transmission, ACh could also act as a neuroprotective agent.",

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) expression is elevated in plaque-surrounding astrocytes in AD patients. However, the role of CTGF in AD pathogenesis remains unclear. Here we characterized the neuroprotective activity of CTGF. We found that CTGF facilitated Abeta uptake and subsequent degradation within primary glia and neuroblastoma cells. CTGF enhanced extracellular Abeta degradation via membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP14) in glia and extracellular MMP13 in neurons. In the brain of a Drosophila AD model, glial-expression of CTGF reduced Abeta deposits, improved locomotor function, and rescued memory deficits. Neuroprotective potential of CTGF against Abeta42-induced photoreceptor degeneration was disrupted through silencing MMPs. Therefore, CTGF may represent a node for potential AD therapeutics as it intervenes in glia-neuron communication via specific MMPs to alleviate Abeta neurotoxicity in the central nervous system.",

    "title": "Incremental value of biomarker combinations to predict progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia can be predicted by cognitive, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers. Since most biomarkers reveal complementary information, a combination of biomarkers may increase the predictive power. We investigated which combination of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)-sum-of-boxes, the word list delayed free recall from the Consortium to Establish a Registry of Dementia (CERAD) test battery, hippocampal volume (HCV), amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta42), amyloid-beta1-40 (Abeta40) levels, the ratio of Abeta42/Abeta40, phosphorylated tau, and total tau (t-Tau) levels in the CSF best predicted a short-term conversion from MCI to AD dementia. METHODS: We used 115 complete datasets from MCI patients of the \"Dementia Competence Network\", a German multicenter cohort study with annual follow-up up to 3 years. MCI was broadly defined to include amnestic and nonamnestic syndromes. Variables known to predict progression in MCI patients were selected a priori. Nine individual predictors were compared by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. ROC curves of the five best two-, three-, and four-parameter combinations were analyzed for significant superiority by a bootstrapping wrapper around a support vector machine with linear kernel. The incremental value of combinations was tested for statistical significance by comparing the specificities of the different classifiers at a given sensitivity of 85%. RESULTS: Out of 115 subjects, 28 (24.3%) with MCI progressed to AD dementia within a mean follow-up period of 25.5 months. At baseline, MCI-AD patients were no different from stable MCI in age and gender distribution, but had lower educational attainment. All single biomarkers were significantly different between the two groups at baseline. ROC curves of the individual predictors gave areas under the curve (AUC) between 0.66 and 0.77, and all single predictors were statistically superior to Abeta40. The AUC of the two-parameter combinations ranged from 0.77 to 0.81. The three-parameter combinations ranged from AUC 0.80-0.83, and the four-parameter combination from AUC 0.81-0.82. None of the predictor combinations was significantly superior to the two best single predictors (HCV and t-Tau). When maximizing the AUC differences by fixing sensitivity at 85%, the two- to four-parameter combinations were superior to HCV alone. CONCLUSION: A combination of two biomarkers of neurodegeneration (e.g., HCV and t-Tau) is not superior over the single parameters in identifying patients with MCI who are most likely to progress to AD dementia, although there is a gradual increase in the statistical measures across increasing biomarker combinations. This may have implications for clinical diagnosis and for selecting subjects for participation in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "In the amyloidogenic pathway associated with Alzheimer disease (AD), the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by beta-secretase to generate a 99-aa C-terminal fragment (C99) that is then cleaved by gamma-secretase to generate the beta-amyloid (Abeta) found in senile plaques. In previous reports, we and others have shown that gamma-secretase activity is enriched in mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes (MAM) and that ER-mitochondrial connectivity and MAM function are upregulated in AD We now show that C99, in addition to its localization in endosomes, can also be found in MAM, where it is normally processed rapidly by gamma-secretase. In cell models of AD, however, the concentration of unprocessed C99 increases in MAM regions, resulting in elevated sphingolipid turnover and an altered lipid composition of both MAM and mitochondrial membranes. In turn, this change in mitochondrial membrane composition interferes with the proper assembly and activity of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes, thereby likely contributing to the bioenergetic defects characteristic of AD.",

    "title": "Negatively charged food additive dye \"Allura Red\" rapidly induces SDS-soluble amyloid fibril in beta-lactoglobulin protein.",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have led to an increased interest to categorize small molecular inhibitors of protein fibrillation. In this study, we used spectroscopy, microscopy and gel electrophoresis techniques that provides an elaborated description of the Allura Red-induced amyloid fibrillation in the beta-LG protein at two pHs (7.4 and 3.5). The spectroscopy results show that beta-LG protein form aggregates in the presence of Allura Red (0.04-15.0mM) at pH 3.5 due to electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. However, at pH 7.4, the beta-LG does not interact electrostatically with Allura Red and therefore no aggregation occurred. The Allura Red-induced aggregates have an amyloid-like structure that was confirmed by far-UV CD, Congo Red and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The CD spectrum of beta-LG contains single minima at ~218nm, which shifts towards higher wavelength minima at ~225nm in the presence of Allura Red, characteristics of the cross beta-sheet structure. The TEM results suggest that beta-LG form long straight fibril when exposed to Allura Red at pH 3.5. The Allura Red-induced amyloid fibril is SDS-soluble confirmed by SDS-PAGE techniques. A far UV CD result shows the conversion of Allura Red induced cross beta-sheet structure into alpha-helical structure in the presence of increasing concentration of SDS. The results of this study suggest that the electrostatic, as well as hydrophobic interactions play an important role during Allura Red-induced beta-LG fibrillation.",

    "abstract": "Our previous studies have shown that the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 interacts with LC3 and is required for starvation and rapamycin-induced activation of autophagy. Here, we report that NEDD4 directly binds to SQSTM1 via its HECT domain and polyubiquitylates SQSTM1. This ubiquitylation is through K63 conjugation and is not involved in proteasomal degradation. Mutational analysis indicates that NEDD4 interacts with and ubiquitylates the PB1 domain of SQSTM1. Depletion of NEDD4 or overexpression of the ligase-defective mutant of NEDD4 induced accumulation of aberrant enlarged SQSTM1-positive inclusion bodies that are co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker CANX, suggesting that the ubiquitylation functions in the SQSTM1-mediated biogenic process in inclusion body autophagosomes. Taken together, our studies show that NEDD4 is an autophagic E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitylates SQSTM1, facilitating SQSTM1-mediated inclusion body autophagy.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, characterized by excessive beta amyloid (Abeta) deposition in brain, leading to blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. The mechanisms of BBB disruption in AD are still unclear, despite considerable research. The adipokine adiponectin is known to regulate various metabolic functions and reduce inflammation. Though adiponectin receptors have been reported in the brain, its role in the central nervous system has not been fully characterized. In the present study, we investigate whether adiponectin contributes to the tight junction integrity and cell death of brain endothelial cells under Abeta-induced toxicity conditions. We measured the expression of adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) and the alteration of tight junction proteins in in vivo 5xFAD mouse brain. Moreover, we examined the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the loss of tight junction proteins such as Claudin 5, ZO-1, and inflammatory signaling in in vitro brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3 cells) under Abeta toxicity. Our results showed that Acrp30 (a globular form of adiponectin) reduces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and the expression of RAGE as Abeta transporters into brain. Moreover, we found that Acrp 30 attenuated the apoptosis and the tight junction disruption through AdipoR1-mediated NF-kappaB pathway in Abeta-exposed bEnd.3 cells. Thus, we suggest that adiponectin is an attractive therapeutic target for treating BBB breakdown in AD brain.",

    "title": "Cooperation of Rel family members in regulating Abeta1-40-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by retinal pigment epithelial cells.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) is a hallmark component of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which induces secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines from retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Previous studies have shown that p50/RelA (p65), a member of NF-kappaB family, is an essential pro-inflammatory transcription factor responding to Abeta1-40 stimulation, but few focused on the other two Rel transcription factor members - RelB and c-Rel - and their role in Abeta1-40-mediated inflammation. It was reported that RelA, RelB and c-Rel are also implicated in various NF-kappaB-mediated inflammatory diseases. Therefore, we infer that Abeta1-40-mediated inflammation targets not only the classical inflammation regulator, RelA, but also RelB and c-Rel. In this study, we demonstrate that intravitreally injected Abeta1-40 mice develop AMD-like pathologic changes, coupled with Rel protein (RelA, RelB and c-Rel) synthesis and nuclear translocation. To focus on the interaction mechanism of Rel proteins, we found that RelB and c-Rel formed a heterodimer with RelA in mice model. We also found that c-Rel silencing decreased the levels of Abeta1-40-dependent RelA expression, indicating that RelB and c-Rel may interact with RelA as coactivator and c-Rel is required to activate the expression of RelA. Moreover, Rel protein silencing decreased the expression of distinct pro-inflammatory cytokines. Together, we demonstrate that besides RelA, RelB and c-Rel can also be activated by Abeta1-40, all of which mediate pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription and RPE damage. Our findings imply that RPE-mediated inflammation under the stimulation of Abeta1-40 is multi-targeted and RelA, RelB and c-Rel proteins may be the new targets of anti-inflammatory agents.",

We present evidence that neurons exposed to Abeta are unable to form new synapses, resulting in learning deficits in vivo. We demonstrate the Nogo receptor family (NgR1-3) acts as Abeta receptors mediating an inhibition of synapse assembly, plasticity, and learning. Live imaging studies reveal Abeta activates NgRs on the dendritic shaft of neurons, triggering an inhibition of calcium signaling. We define T-type calcium channels as a target of Abeta-NgR signaling, mediating Abeta's inhibitory effects on calcium, synapse assembly, plasticity, and learning. These studies highlight deficits in new synapse assembly as a potential initiator of cognitive pathology in AD, and pinpoint calcium dysregulation mediated by NgRs and T-type channels as key components.

Kinetic studies have contributed significantly towards a mechanistic understanding of amyloid fibril self-assembly, however dynamic features of the aggregation process cannot be captured using ensemble methods. Here we present an assay for imaging Abeta42 aggregation dynamics at the single fibril level, allowing for the quantitative extraction of concentration and temperature dependent kinetic parameters. From direct observation of elongation using TIRF and super-resolution optical microscopy, we find that Abeta42 fibril growth is strongly polarized, with fast and slow growing ends arising from different elongation rates, but also from a growth incompetent state, which dominates the process at the slow growing end. Our findings reveal the surprising complexity of the Abeta42 fibril elongation reaction at the microscopic level.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is based on diagnostic clinical criteria, which were updated over the years. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, through a systematic review, accuracy of the diagnostic criteria, testing a possible improvement over time. METHODS: We searched on MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases for studies reporting diagnostic parameters regarding the clinical diagnosis of DLB until October 2016. We performed meta-analysis, using a Bayesian approach, on those using pathological examination as gold standard, subclassified based on the different diagnostic criteria used. RESULTS: We selected 22 studies on 1585 patients. Pooled sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 60.2%, 93.8%, 79.7%, respectively, for criteria antecedents to McKeith 1996. For McKeith 1996-possible, pooled sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 65.6%, 80.6%, 77.9% in early stages and 72.3%, 64.3%, 66% in late stages, respectively. For McKeith 1996-probable, pooled sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 19.4%, 95.1%, 77.7% in early stages and 48.6%, 88%, 79.2% in late stages, respectively. McKeith criteria 2005 were evaluated only in late stages: pooled sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 91.3%, 66.7% and 81.6%, respectively, for possible diagnosis (only one study) and 88.3%, 80.8%, 90.7% for probable diagnosis, decreasing to 85.6%, 77.1% and 81.7% if only considering clinical settings focused on dementia diagnosis and care. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Diagnostic criteria have become more sensitive and less specific over time, without substantial change in the accuracy. Based on current data, about 20% of DLB diagnosis are incorrect. Future studies are needed to evaluate if the recently released revised consensus criteria will improve the diagnostic accuracy of DLB.",

Fifteen derivatives eliciting increased green to red fluorescence percentage less than 40.0% were evaluated for their impact on ATP production, cell viability and neuroprotection against Abeta-induced neuronal cell death. Among evaluated compounds, derivatives 9w, 9r and 9k had safe profile regarding ATP production and cell viability. In addition, they exhibited significant neuroprotection (69.3, 51.8 and 48.2% respectively).

    "abstract": "Although some naturally occurring polyphenols have been found to inhibit amyloid beta (Abeta) fibril formation and reduce neuron cell toxicity in vitro, their exact inhibitory mechanism is unknown. In this work, discontinuous molecular dynamics combined with the PRIME20 force field and a newly built inhibitor model are performed to examine the effect of vanillin, resveratrol, curcumin, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on the aggregation of Abeta(17-36) peptides. Four sets of peptide/inhibitor simulations are performed in which inhibitors (1) bind to Abeta(17-36) monomer (2) interfere with Abeta(17-36) oligomerization (3) disrupt a pre-formed Abeta(17-36) protofilament, and (4) prevent the growth of Abeta(17-36) protofilament. The single-ring compound, vanillin, slightly slows down but cannot inhibit the formation of a U-shaped Abeta(17-36) protofilament. The multiple-ring compounds, EGCG, resveratrol, and curcumin, redirect Abeta(17-36) from a fibrillar aggregate to an unstructured oligomer. The three aromatic groups of the EGCG molecule are in a stereo (nonplanar) configuration, helping it contact the N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal regions of the peptide. Resveratrol and curcumin bind only to the hydrophobic residues near peptide termini. The rank order of inhibitory effectiveness of Abeta(17-36) aggregation is as follows: EGCG > resveratrol > curcumin > vanillin, consistent with experimental findings on inhibiting full-length Abeta fibrillation. Furthermore, we learn that the inhibition effect of EGCG is specific to the peptide sequence, while those of resveratrol and curcumin are non-specific in that they stem from strong interference with hydrophobic side-chain association, regardless of the residues' location and peptide sequence. Our studies provide molecular-level insights into how polyphenols inhibit Abeta fibril formation, knowledge that could be useful for designing amyloid inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increased risk for dementia, yet mechanisms are poorly understood. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent literature suggests several potential mechanisms by which sleep impairments might contribute to the increased risk of dementia observed in PTSD. First, molecular, animal, and imaging studies indicate that sleep problems lead to cellular damage in brain structures crucial to learning and memory. Second, recent studies have shown that lack of sleep might precipitate the accumulation of harmful amyloid proteins. Finally, sleep and PTSD are associated with elevated inflammation, which, in turn, is associated with dementia, possibly via cytokine-mediated neural toxicity and reduced neurogenesis. A better understanding of these mechanisms may yield novel treatment approaches to reduce neurodegeneration in PTSD. The authors emphasize the importance of including sleep data in studies of PTSD and cognition and identify next steps.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of many neurodegenerative diseases termed synucleinopathies, neuropathologically defined by inclusions containing aggregated alpha-synuclein (alphaS). alphaS gene (SNCA) mutations can directly cause autosomal dominant PD. In vitro studies demonstrated that SNCA missense mutations may either enhance or diminish alphaS aggregation but cross-seeding of mutant and wild-type alphaS proteins appear to reduce aggregation efficiency. Here, we extended these studies by assessing the effects of seeded alphaS aggregation in alphaS transgenic mice through intracerebral or peripheral injection of various mutant alphaS fibrils. We observed modestly decreased time to paralysis in mice transgenic for human A53T alphaS (line M83) intramuscularly injected with H50Q, G51D or A53E alphaS fibrils relative to wild-type alphaS fibrils. Conversely, E46K alphaS fibril seeding was significantly delayed and less efficient in the same experimental paradigm. However, the amount and distribution of alphaS inclusions in the central nervous system were similar for all alphaS fibril muscle injected mice that developed paralysis. Mice transgenic for human alphaS (line M20) injected in the hippocampus with wild-type, H50Q, G51D or A53E alphaS fibrils displayed induction of alphaS inclusion pathology that increased and spread over time. By comparison, induction of alphaS aggregation following the intrahippocampal injection of E46K alphaS fibrils in M20 mice was much less efficient. These findings show that H50Q, G51D or A53E can efficiently cross-seed and induce alphaS pathology in vivo. In contrast, E46K alphaS fibrils are intrinsically inefficient at seeding alphaS inclusion pathology. Consistent with previous in vitro studies, E46K alphaS polymers are likely distinct aggregated conformers that may represent a unique prion-like strain of alphaS.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The recent failure of several clinical trials on anti-beta-amyloid (Abeta) drugs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggested earlier intervention in the disease course. Secondary prevention trials have been started in autosomal-dominant AD (ADAD) individuals without cognitive dysfunction and in cognitively healthy subjects at risk of developing sporadic AD (SAD). AREAS COVERED: Herein, the authors discuss prevention trials in ADAD and SAD, with a focus on the anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies solanezumab and gantenerumab presently in Phase III clinical development. These therapies are also being tested in the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU). EXPERT OPINION: Anti-Abeta monoclonal antibodies are being tested in subjects at the preclinical stage of ADAD and even in symptom-free subjects at risk of developing SAD. The subsequent DIAN-TU Adaptive Prevention Trial is a 4-year study that will assess whether such biomarker effects may stop the progress of the AD process, preventing cognitive symptoms. The hope is to interfere in the disease course when it is not too late. A clinical success of these prevention trials would represent the proof of the Abeta hypothesis of AD.",

    "title": "Distinct deposition of amyloid-beta species in brains with Alzheimer's disease pathology visualized with MALDI imaging mass spectrometry.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition in the brain is an early and invariable feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Abeta peptides are composed of about 40 amino acids and are generated from amyloid precursor proteins (APP), by beta- and gamma-secretases. The distribution of individual Abeta peptides in the brains of aged people, and those suffering from AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is not fully characterized. We employed the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) to illustrate the spatial distribution of a broad range of Abeta species in human autopsied brains. With technical advancements such as formic acid pretreatment of frozen autopsied brain samples, we have: i) demonstrated that Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-43 were selectively deposited in senile plaques while full-length Abeta peptides such as Abeta1-36, 1-37, 1-38, 1-39, 1-40, and Abeta1-41 were deposited in leptomeningeal blood vessels. ii) Visualized distinct depositions of N-terminal truncated Abeta40 and Abeta42, including pyroglutamate modified at Glu-3 (N3pE), only with IMS for the first time. iii) Demonstrated that one single amino acid alteration at the C-terminus between Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-41 results in profound changes in their distribution pattern. In vitro, this can be attributed to the difference in the self-aggregation ability amongst Abeta1-40, Abeta1-41, and Abeta1-42. These observations were further confirmed with immunohistochemistry (IHC), using the newly developed anti-Abeta1-41 antibody. Here, distinct depositions of truncated and/or modified C- and N-terminal fragments of Abetas in AD and CAA brains with MALDI-IMS were visualized in a spacio-temporal specific manner. Specifically, Abeta1-41 was detected both with MALDI-IMS and IHC suggesting that a single amino acid alteration at the C-terminus of Abeta results in drastic distribution changes. These results suggest that MALDI-IMS could be used as a standard approach in combination with clinical, genetic, and pathological observations in understanding the pathology of AD and CAA.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) initiates a cascade of pathological events, including activation of microglial cells, oxidative stress, and inflammation, leading to neuronal death and the typical pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Flavonoids have been reported to exert neuroprotective activities, not only through their generally accepted antioxidant effects, but also through their ability to protect against neurotoxin-induced injury. Flavonoids reduce Abeta production, inhibit neuroinflammation, increase cerebrovascular function, and improve cognitive performance. Here, we analyzed the effects of a flavonoid-rich ethanol extract from the leaves of Diospyros kaki (FLDK) in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. We found that oral treatment with FLDK reversed learning and memory impairment, reduced Abeta burden and expression of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1), and decreased microglial activation in senile plaques. FLDK restored antioxidant enzyme activities, as well as reduced the lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde, and inflammatory mediators. These results demonstrate that FLDK alleviates cognitive decline and reduces Abeta burden, microglial activation, oxidative stress, and inflammation responses. Thus, FLDK treatment may be a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing and treating AD, at least in part via its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory biological activities and its effect on the Abeta producing enzyme BACE1.",

    "abstract": "A direct observation of amyloid aggregation from isolated peptides to cross-beta fibrils is crucial for understanding the nucleation-dependence process, but the corresponding macroscopic timescales impose a major computational challenge. Using rapid all-atom discrete molecular dynamics simulations, we capture the oligomerization and fibrillization dynamics of the amyloid core sequences of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) in type-2 diabetes, namely Abeta16-22 and IAPP22-28. Both peptides and their mixture spontaneously assemble into cross-beta aggregates in silico, but follow distinct pathways. Abeta16-22 is highly aggregation-prone with a funneled free energy basin toward multi-layer beta-sheet aggregates. IAPP22-28, on the other hand, features the accumulation of unstructured oligomers before the nucleation of beta-sheets and growth into double-layer beta-sheet aggregates. In the presence of Abeta16-22, the aggregation of IAPP22-28 is promoted by forming co-aggregated multi-layer beta-sheets. Our study offers a detailed molecular insight to the long-postulated oligomerization-nucleation process in the amyloid aggregations.",

    "abstract": "ABCG4 is an ATP-binding cassette transmembrane protein which has been shown, in vitro, to participate in the cellular efflux of desmosterol and amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). ABCG4 is highly expressed in the brain, but its localization and function at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) level remain unknown. We demonstrate by qRT-PCR and confocal imaging that mouse Abcg4 is expressed in the brain capillary endothelial cells. Modelling studies of the Abcg4 dimer suggested that desmosterol showed thermodynamically favorable binding at the putative sterol-binding site, and this was greater than for cholesterol. Additionally, unbiased docking also showed Abeta binding at this site. Using a novel Abcg4-deficient mouse model, we show that Abcg4 was able to export Abeta and desmosterol at the BBB level and these processes could be inhibited by probucol and L-thyroxine. Our assay also showed that desmosterol antagonized the export of Abeta, presumably as both bind at the sterol-binding site on Abcg4. We show for the first time that Abcg4 may function in vivo to export Abeta at the BBB, in a process that can be antagonized by its putative natural ligand, desmosterol (and possibly cholesterol).",

    "abstract": "beta-Amyloid (Abeta) aggregation is thought to initiate a cascade of neurodegenerative events in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Much effort is underway to develop strategies to reduce Abeta concentration or inhibit aggregation. Cathepsin B (CatB) proteolytically degrades Abeta into non-aggregating fragments but is potently inhibited by cystatin C (CysC). It has been suggested that decreasing CysC would facilitate Abeta clearance by relieving CatB inhibition. However, CysC binds Abeta and inhibits Abeta aggregation, suggesting that an intervention that increases CysC would prevent Abeta aggregation. Both approaches have been tested in animal models, yielding contradictory results, possibly because of the opposing influences of CysC on Abeta degradation versus aggregation. Here, we sought to develop a model that quantitatively predicts the effects of CysC and CatB on Abeta aggregation. Abeta aggregation kinetics in the absence of CatB or CysC was measured. The rate constant for Abeta degradation by CatB and the equilibrium constant for binding of CysC to Abeta were determined. We derived a mathematical model that combines material balances and kinetic rate equations. The model accurately predicted Abeta aggregation kinetics at various CatB and CysC concentrations. We derived approximate expressions for the half-times of degradation and aggregation and show that their ratio can be used to estimate, at any given Abeta, CatB, or CysC concentration, whether Abeta aggregation or degradation will result. Our results may be useful for designing experiments and interpreting results from investigations of manipulation of CysC concentration as an AD therapy.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common form of dementia and amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) aggregation is considered to be one of its main causes. Paeoniflorin has been previously shown to attenuate cognitive damage inflicted by exogenous Abeta protein. Using transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans models expressing human Abeta1-42, we demonstrate here that paeoniflorin can delay progressive paralysis caused by endogenous Abeta expression and reduce the amount of toxic Abeta oligomers in vivo, although it has no effect on Abeta aggregation in vitro. Paeoniflorin does not, however, affect the lifespan of either wild-type or AD-like nematodes, implying a mechanism independent of a general antiaging effect. We then demonstrate that paeoniflorin can reduce reactive oxygen species levels in C. elegans AD models, which may contribute to its in vivo suppression of Abeta toxicity. Moreover, paeoniflorin is shown to upregulate the expression of the small heat shock protein HSP-16.2 as it is capable of increasing the hsp-16.2 transcript level in wild-type as well as AD-like nematodes and enhancing the fluorescence intensity in hsp-16.2::GFP nematodes. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the underlying mechanisms of the protective effect of paeoniflorin against age-onset Abeta proteotoxicity, which are, in part, connected with oxidative and heat shock stress responses.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD). Previous studies have shown that the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) that have anti-diabetic properties show very promising effects in animal models of AD. Glucagon (Gcg) is a hormone and growth-factor, and the Gcg receptor is expressed in the brain. Here we test the effects of a triple receptor agonist (TA), which activates GIP-1, GIP and glucagon receptors at the same time. In the present study, the effects of the TA were evaluated in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD. The TA was injected once-daily (10 nmol/kg i.p.) for two months. The results showed that treatment with TA significantly reversed the memory deficit in the APP/PS1 mice in a spatial water maze test. Moreover, the drug reduced levels of the mitochondrial pro-apoptotic signaling molecule BAX, increased the anti-apoptotic signaling molecule Bcl-2 and enhanced the levels of BDNF, a key growth factor that protects synaptic function. Levels of synaptophysin were enhanced, demonstrating protection from synaptic loss that is observed in AD. Neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus was furthermore enhanced as shown in the increase of doublecortin positive cells. Furthermore, TA treatment reduced the total amount of beta-amyloid, reduced neuroinflammation (activated microglia and astrocytes), and oxidative stress in the cortex and hippocampus. Thus, these findings show that novel TAs are a promising lead for the design of future treatment strategies in AD.",

We validated almost all genes genetically, assessed damaging effects of the gene variants in cell models and further consolidated a role for several of these genes in the aetiology of spinocerebellar ataxia through network analysis.

In the brains of Alzheimer's disease sufferers, amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides aggregate to form senile plaques but as soluble peptides are toxic to synapses. We previously demonstrated that Abeta induces Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), which in turn activates the Wnt-planar cell polarity (Wnt-PCP) pathway to drive tau pathology and neuronal death. METHODS: We compared the effects of Abeta and of Dkk1 on synapse morphology and memory impairment while inhibiting or silencing key elements of the Wnt-PCP pathway. RESULTS: We demonstrate that Abeta synaptotoxicity is also Dkk1 and Wnt-PCP dependent, mediated by the arm of Wnt-PCP regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics via Daam1, RhoA and ROCK, and can be blocked by the drug fasudil. DISCUSSION: Our data add to the importance of aberrant Wnt signaling in Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and indicate that fasudil could be repurposed as a treatment for the disease.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid plaque is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The key component beta-amyloid (Abeta) is generated via proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Sortilin (encoded by the gene Sort1) is a vacuolar protein sorting 10 protein domain-containing receptor, which is up-regulated in the brain of AD, colocalizes with amyloid plaques and interacts with APP. However, its role in amyloidogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we first found that the protein level of sortilin was up-regulated in the neocortex of aged (7 and 9months old) but not young (2 and 5months old) AD mice (APP/PS1). 9months old APP/PS1 transgenic mice with Sort1 gene knockout showed increased amyloid pathology in the brain; and this phenotype was rescued by intrahippocampal injection of AAV-hSORT1. Moreover, the 9months old APP/PS1 mice without Sort1 also displayed a decreased number of neurons and increased astrocyte activation in the hippocampus. In addition, the present study showed that the intracellular domain of sortilin was involved in the regulation of the non-specific degradation of APP. Together, our findings indicate that sortilin is a beneficial protein for the reduction of amyloid pathology in APP/PS1 mice by promoting APP degradation.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder known for the typical motor features associated. Pathologically, it is characterized by the intracellular accumulation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. Currently, there are no established biochemical markers for diagnosing or for following disease progression, a major limitation for the clinical practice. Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in aSyn have been identified and implicated on its pathobiology. Since aSyn is abundant in blood erythrocytes, we aimed to evaluate whether PTMs of aSyn in the blood might hold value as a biomarker for PD. We examined 58 patients with PD and 30 healthy age-matched individuals. We found that the levels of Y125 phosphorylated, Y39 nitrated, and glycated aSyn were increased in PD, while those of SUMO were reduced. A combinatory analysis of the levels of these PTMs resulted in an increased sensitivity, with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.843 for PD versus healthy controls, and correlated with disease severity and duration. We conclude that the levels of these selected PTMs hold strong potential as biochemical markers for PD. Ultimately, our findings might facilitate the monitoring of disease progression in clinical trials, opening the possibility for developing more effective therapies against PD.",

An early BBB breakdown and/or dysfunction have been shown in Alzheimer's disease (AD) before dementia, neurodegeneration and/or brain atrophy occur. However, the role of BBB breakdown in neurodegenerative disorders is still not fully understood. Here, we examine BBB breakdown in animal models frequently used to study the pathophysiology of AD, including transgenic mice expressing human amyloid-beta precursor protein, presenilin 1, and tau mutations, and apolipoprotein E, the strongest genetic risk factor for AD. We discuss the role of BBB breakdown and dysfunction in neurodegenerative process, pitfalls in BBB measurements, and how targeting the BBB can influence the course of neurological disorder. Finally, we comment on future approaches and models to better define, at the cellular and molecular level, the underlying mechanisms between BBB breakdown and neurodegeneration as a basis for developing new therapies for BBB repair to control neurodegeneration.",

METHODS: We studied the impact of combined leptin and pioglitazone treatment in 6-month-old APP/PS1 (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) transgenic AD mouse model. RESULTS: We report that an acute 2-week treatment with combined leptin and pioglitazone resulted in a reduction of spatial memory deficits (Y maze) and brain beta-amyloid levels (soluble beta-amyloid and amyloid plaque burden) relative to vehicle-treated animals. Combination treatment was also associated with amelioration in plaque-associated neuritic pathology and synapse loss, and also a significantly reduced neocortical glial response.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The glymphatic system is a brain-wide perivascular network that facilitates clearance of proteins, including amyloid beta, from the brain interstitium through the perivascular exchange of cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid. The astrocytic water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is required for glymphatic system function, and impairment of glymphatic function in the aging brain is associated with altered AQP4 expression and localization. In human cortical tissue, alterations in AQP4 expression and localization are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) status and pathology. Although this suggests a potential role for AQP4 in the development or progression of AD, the relationship between of naturally occurring variants in the human AQP4 gene and cognitive function has not yet been evaluated. METHODS: Using data from several longitudinal aging cohorts, we investigated the association between five AQP4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the rate of cognitive decline in participants with a diagnosis of AD. RESULTS: None of the five SNPs were associated with different rates of AD diagnosis, age of dementia onset in trial subjects. No association between AQP4 SNPs with histological measures of AD pathology, including Braak stage or neuritic plaque density was observed. However, AQP4 SNPs were associated with altered rates of cognitive decline after AD diagnosis, with two SNPS (rs9951307 and rs3875089) associated with slower cognitive decline and two (rs3763040 and rs3763043) associated with more rapid cognitive decline after AD diagnosis. DISCUSSION: These results provide the first evidence that variations in the AQP4 gene, whose gene product AQP4 is vital for glymphatic pathway function, may modulate the progression of cognitive decline in AD.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We performed a meta-analysis to synthesise current evidence on amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET) burden and presumed preferential occipital distribution in sporadic cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). METHODS: In a PubMed systematic search, we identified case-control studies with extractable data on global and occipital-to-global amyloid-PET uptake in symptomatic patients with CAA (per Boston criteria) versus control groups (healthy participants or patients with non-CAA deep intracerebral haemorrhage) and patients with Alzheimer's disease. To circumvent PET studies' methodological variation, we generated and used 'fold change', that is, ratio of mean amyloid uptake (global and occipital-to-global) of CAA relative to comparison groups. Amyloid-PET uptake biomarker performance was then quantified by random-effects meta-analysis on the ratios of the means. A ratio >1 indicates that amyloid-PET uptake (global or occipital/global) is higher in CAA than comparison groups, and a ratio <1 indicates the reverse. RESULTS: Seven studies, including 106 patients with CAA (>90% with probable CAA) and 138 controls (96 healthy elderly, 42 deep intracerebral haemorrhage controls) and 72 patients with Alzheimer's disease, were included. Global amyloid-PET ratio between patients with CAA and controls was above 1, with an average effect size of 1.18 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.28; p<0.0001). Occipital-to-global amyloid-PET uptake ratio did not differ between patients with CAA versus patients with deep intracerebral haemorrhage or healthy controls. By contrast, occipital-to-global amyloid-PET uptake ratio was above 1 in patients with CAA versus those with Alzheimer's disease, with an average ratio of 1.10 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.19; p=0.009) and high statistical heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis provides exploratory actionable data on the overall effect sizes and strength of amyloid-PET burden and distribution in patients with CAA, useful for future larger studies.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, characterised by extracellular amyloid deposition as plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein. As no current clinical test can diagnose individuals at risk of developing AD, the aim of this project is to evaluate a blood-based biomarker panel to identify individuals who carry this risk. We analysed the levels of 22 biomarkers in clinically classified healthy controls (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's participants from the well characterised Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of aging. High levels of IL-10 and IL-12/23p40 were significantly associated with amyloid deposition in HC, suggesting that these two biomarkers might be used to detect at risk individuals. Additionally, other biomarkers (Eotaxin-3, Leptin, PYY) exhibited altered levels in AD participants possessing the APOE epsilon4 allele. This suggests that the physiology of some potential biomarkers may be altered in AD due to the APOE epsilon4 allele, a major risk factor for AD. Taken together, these data highlight several potential biomarkers that can be used in a blood-based panel to allow earlier identification of individuals at risk of developing AD and/or early stage AD for which current therapies may be more beneficial.",

    "abstract": "The elusive relationship between underlying pathology and clinical disease hampers diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and preventative intervention development. We seek to understand the relationship between two classical AD biomarkers, amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) and total-tau (t-tau), and define their trajectories across disease development, as defined by disease onset at diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Using longitudinal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we performed a correlation analysis of biomarkers CSF Abeta1-42 and t-tau, and longitudinal quantile analysis. Using a mixed effects model, with MCI onset as an anchor, we develop linear trajectories to describe the rate of change across disease development. These trajectories were extended through the incorporation of data from cognitively normal, healthy adults (aged 20-62 years) from the literature, to fit sigmoid curves by means of non-linear least squares estimators, to create curves encompassing the 50 years prior to MCI onset. A strong right-angled relationship between the biomarkers Abeta1-42 and t-tau is detected, implying a highly non-linear relationship. The rate of change of Abeta1-42 is correlated with the baseline concentration per quantile, reflecting a reduction in the rate of loss across disease within subjects. Regression models reveal significant amyloid loss relative to MCI onset (- 2.35 pg/mL/year), compared to minimal loss relative to AD onset (- 0.97 pg/mL/year). Tau accumulates consistently relative to MCI and AD onset, (2.05 pg/mL/year) and (2.46 pg/mL/year), respectively. The fitted amyloid curve shows peak loss of amyloid 8.06 years prior to MCI diagnosis, while t-tau exhibits peak accumulation 14.17 years following MCI diagnosis, with the upper limit not yet reached 30 years post diagnosis. Biomarker trajectories aid unbiased, objective assessment of disease progression. Quantitative trajectories are likely to be of use in clinical trial design, as they allow for a more detailed insight into the effectiveness of treatments designed to delay development of biological disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) comprises multifactorial ailments for which current therapeutic strategies remain insufficient to broadly address the underlying pathophysiology. Epigenetic gene regulation relies upon multifactorial processes that regulate multiple gene and protein pathways, including those involved in AD. We therefore took an epigenetic approach where a single drug would simultaneously affect the expression of a number of defined AD-related targets. We show that the small-molecule histone deacetylase inhibitor M344 reduces beta-amyloid (Abeta), reduces tau Ser396 phosphorylation, and decreases both beta-secretase (BACE) and APOEepsilon4 gene expression. M344 increases the expression of AD-relevant genes: BDNF, alpha-secretase (ADAM10), MINT2, FE65, REST, SIRT1, BIN1, and ABCA7, among others. M344 increases sAPPalpha and CTFalpha APP metabolite production, both cleavage products of ADAM10, concordant with increased ADAM10 gene expression. M344 also increases levels of immature APP, supporting an effect on APP trafficking, concurrent with the observed increase in MINT2 and FE65, both shown to increase immature APP in the early secretory pathway. Chronic i.p. treatment of the triple transgenic (APPsw/PS1M146V/TauP301L) mice with M344, at doses as low as 3 mg/kg, significantly prevented cognitive decline evaluated by Y-maze spontaneous alternation, novel object recognition, and Barnes maze spatial memory tests. M344 displays short brain exposure, indicating that brief pulses of daily drug treatment may be sufficient for long-term efficacy. Together, these data show that M344 normalizes several disparate pathogenic pathways related to AD. M344 therefore serves as an example of how a multitargeting compound could be used to address the polygenic nature of multifactorial diseases.",

Changes of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) metabolism and increased glucocorticoid (GC) levels have been found in both depression and AD. Moreover, several studies in animal models have demonstrated that GC administration changes Abeta metabolism. To reveal whether GC affects amyloid metabolism in patients with depression, we evaluated serum levels of Abeta40, Abeta42 and cortisol at admission in 187 inpatients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 224 healthy comparisons. Additionally, we re-evaluated the serum levels of Abetas in 27 patients with MDD 1 year later. The results of multiple regression analyses revealed that serum cortisol and Abeta levels are not correlated at the time of admission. However, serum cortisol levels at admission correlated with serum Abeta42 levels and Abeta40/Abeta42 ratio 1 year later. These findings suggest that increased cortisol in patients with MDD may influence the metabolism of Abeta over prolonged periods of time.",

It is well known that such neurological abnormalities are preceded by long-term exposure of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) and/or hyperphosphorylated tau prior. In addition to the neurological deficit, astrocytes as a major glial cell type in the brain, significantly participate in the neuropathogenic mechanisms underlying synaptic modulation. Although astrocytes play a significant key role in modulating synaptic transmission, little is known on whether astrocyte dysfunction caused by such long-term Abeta exposure affects synapse formation and function. Here, we show that synapse formation and synaptic transmission are attenuated in hippocampal-naive neurons co-cultured with astrocytes that have previously experienced chronic Abeta1-40 exposure. In this abnormal astrocytic condition, hippocampal neurons exhibit decrements of evoked excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) and miniature EPSC frequency. Furthermore, size of readily releasable synaptic pools and number of excitatory synapses were also significantly decreased. Contrary to these negative effects, release probability at individual synapses was significantly increased in the same astrocytic condition. Taken together, our data indicate that lower synaptic transmission caused by astrocytes previously, and chronically, exposed to Abeta1-40 is attributable to a small number of synapses with higher release probability.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by pathological brain lesions and a decline in cognitive function. beta-Amyloid peptides (Abeta), derived from proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), play a central role in AD pathogenesis. beta-Site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the transmembrane aspartyl protease which initiates Abeta production, is axonally transported in neurons and accumulates in dystrophic neurites near cerebral amyloid deposits in AD. BACE1 is modified by S-palmitoylation at four juxtamembrane cysteine residues. S-palmitoylation is a dynamic posttranslational modification that is important for trafficking and function of several synaptic proteins. Here, we investigated the in vivo significance of BACE1 S-palmitoylation through the analysis of knock-in mice with cysteine-to-alanine substitution at the palmitoylated residues (4CA mice). BACE1 expression, as well as processing of APP and other neuronal substrates, was unaltered in 4CA mice despite the lack of BACE1 S-palmitoylation and reduced lipid raft association. Whereas steady-state Abeta levels were similar, synaptic activity-induced endogenous Abeta production was not observed in 4CA mice. Furthermore, we report a significant reduction of cerebral amyloid burden and BACE1 accumulation in dystrophic neurites in the absence of BACE1 S-palmitoylation in mouse models of AD amyloidosis. Studies in cultured neurons suggest that S-palmitoylation is required for dendritic spine localization and axonal targeting of BACE1. Finally, the lack of BACE1 S-palmitoylation mitigates cognitive deficits in 5XFAD mice. Using transgenic mouse models, these results demonstrate that intrinsic posttranslational S-palmitoylation of BACE1 has a significant impact on amyloid pathogenesis and the consequent cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. The etiology of the disease is unknown, although considerable evidence suggests a critical role for the soluble oligomers of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta). Because Abeta increases the expression of purinergic receptors (P2XRs) in vitro and in vivo, we studied the functional correlation between long-term exposure to Abeta and the ability of P2XRs to modulate network synaptic tone. We used electrophysiological recordings and Ca2+ microfluorimetry to assess the effects of chronic exposure (24 h) to Abeta oligomers (0.5 muM) together with known inhibitors of P2XRs, such as PPADS and apyrase on synaptic function. Changes in the expression of P2XR were quantified using RT-qPCR. We observed changes in the expression of P2X1R, P2X7R and an increase in P2X2R; and also in protein levels in PC12 cells (143%) and hippocampal neurons (120%) with Abeta. In parallel, the reduction on the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs (72% and 35%, respectively) were prevented by P2XR inhibition using a low PPADS concentration. Additionally, the current amplitude and intracellular Ca2+ signals evoked by extracellular ATP were increased (70% and 75%, respectively), suggesting an over activation of purinergic neurotransmission in cells pre-treated with Abeta. Taken together, our findings suggest that Abeta disrupts the main components of synaptic transmission at both pre- and post-synaptic sites, and induces changes in the expression of key P2XRs, especially P2X2R; changing the neuromodulator function of the purinergic tone that could involve the P2X2R as a key factor for cytotoxic mechanisms. These results identify novel targets for the treatment of dementia and other diseases characterized by increased purinergic transmission.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic dysfunction and disconnectivity are core deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), preceding clear changes in histopathology and cognitive functioning. Here, the early and late effects of tau pathology induction on functional network connectivity were investigated in P301L mice. Multichannel EEG oscillations were used to compute (1) coherent activity between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) CA1-CA3 networks; (2) phase-amplitude cross frequency coupling (PAC) between theta and gamma oscillations, which is instrumental in adequate cognitive functioning; (3) information processing as assessed by auditory evoked potentials and oscillations in the passive oddball mismatch negativity-like (MMN) paradigm. At the end, the density of tau aggregation and GABA parvalbumin (PV+) interneurons were quantified by immunohistochemistry. Early weakening of EEG theta oscillations and coherent activity were revealed between the PFC and HPC CA1 and drastic impairments in theta-gamma oscillations PAC from week 2 onwards, while PV+ interneurons count was not altered. Moreover, the tau pathology disrupted the MMN complex amplitude and evoked gamma oscillations to standard and deviant stimuli suggesting altered memory formation and recall. The induction of intracellular tau aggregation by tau seed injection results in early altered connectivity and strong theta-gamma oscillations uncoupling, which may be exploited as an early electrophysiological signature of dysfunctional neuronal networks.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal production of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) by proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is thought to be central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although many efforts have been made to investigate mechanisms that regulate APP processing, many details remain incompletely understood. Sorting nexins (SNXs) are a family of proteins which are involved in many intracellular trafficking events. Several SNXs have been implicated in APP processing and Abeta production. In this study, we extended the investigation to SNX7. We found that overexpression of SNX7 in HEK293T cells reduces the levels of secreted Abeta and beta-cleaved N-terminal APP fragments (sAPPbeta). Moreover, SNX7 overexpression caused a significant reduction of the steady-state levels of APP as well as of the cell surface APP levels. By using NH4Cl and Bafilomycin A1 to inhibit the lysosomal degradative pathway, we found that the reduction of APP induced by SNX7 overexpression was prevented by such inhibition. No change in the cell surface distribution or steady-state levels of BACE1 was detected after overexpression of SNX7. Taken together, these results suggest that SNX7 regulates Abeta production by directing APP for degradation.",

The present study was conducted to investigate whether the combined treatment with selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) offers more beneficial effects than that provided by either of them alone in reversing Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells. Cells were pretreated with 0.1 mumol/L of Se and Zn for 4 h, after treated with 10 mmol/L Abeta25-35 for 24 h. Cells were divided into control and five treated groups, and received either 10 mmol/L Abeta25-35,10 mmol/L Abeta25-35 + 0.1 mumol/L Se, 10 mmol/L Abeta25-35 + 0.1 mumol/L Zn, 10 mmol/LAbeta25-35 + 0.1 mumol/L Se + 0.1 mumol/L Zn, or 0.1 mumol/L Se + 0.1 mumol/L Zn. The result showed that cell viability was decreased in MTT metabolic rate; LDH release and MDA, H2O2, and NO levels were increased and the GSK-3beta and phosphorylated tau protein level were increased in Abeta25-35-treated group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), which whole changes were attenuated by Se and Zn and Se combined Zn. In order to evaluate whether the Se and Zn have an effect on processing pathway of amyloid precursor protein (APP), we examined the activity of gamma-secretase in primary cultured cortical neuron cells. ELISA analysis showed that Se and Zn could inhibit the activity of gamma-secretase. Then we also investigated the effect of Se and Zn on the Abeta1-40 concentration and APP-N-terminal fragment expression from APP695 stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. APP695 stably transfected CHO cells were treated with 0.1 mumol/L Se and Zn; cells were divided into control and four treated groups, which received either 0.5 M DAPT, 0.1 mumol/L Se, 0.1 mumol/L Zn, or 0.1 mumol/L Se + 0.1 mumol/L Zn. Se and Zn could decrease Abeta1-40 production and increase the APP-N-terminal fragment protein expression. These experiments indicate that Se and Zn have a protective effect on AD pathology that a possible mechanism is inhibiting the activity of gamma-secretase to decreasing Abeta1-40 production further influencing the APP processing. Altogether, our findings may provide a novel therapeutic target to treat AD sufferers.",

Although various sensor types have been investigated to enhance sensitivity and LOD, analyte detection and its quantification are still challenging, particularly for protein-protein interactions with low association constants. To solve this problem, here, we used ion concentration polarization (ICP)-based preconcentration to increase the local concentration of analytes in a microfluidic platform for LOD improvement. This was the first demonstration of a microfluidic device with an integrated ICP preconcentrator and interdigitated microelectrode (IME) sensor to detect small changes in surface binding between antigens and antibodies. We detected the amyloid beta (Abeta) protein, an Alzheimer's disease marker, with low binding affinity to its antibodies by adopting ICP preconcentration phenomena. We demonstrated that a combination of ICP preconcentrator and IME sensor increased the LOD by 13.8-fold to femtomolar level (8.15 fM), which corresponds to a significant advance for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "It is not known exactly where amyloid-beta (Abeta) fibrils begin to accumulate in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, we showed that abnormal levels of Abeta42 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be detected before abnormal amyloid can be detected using PET in individuals with preclinical AD. Using these approaches, here we identify the earliest preclinical AD stage in subjects from the ADNI and BioFINDER cohorts. We show that Abeta accumulation preferentially starts in the precuneus, medial orbitofrontal, and posterior cingulate cortices, i.e., several of the core regions of the default mode network (DMN). This early pattern of Abeta accumulation is already evident in individuals with normal Abeta42 in the CSF and normal amyloid PET who subsequently convert to having abnormal CSF Abeta42. The earliest Abeta accumulation is further associated with hypoconnectivity within the DMN and between the DMN and the frontoparietal network, but not with brain atrophy or glucose hypometabolism. Our results suggest that Abeta fibrils start to accumulate predominantly within certain parts of the DMN in preclinical AD and already then affect brain connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is associated with extracellular brain deposits of amyloid plaques containing aggregated amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides. Abeta aggregation occurs via multiple pathways that can be influenced by various compounds. Here, we used AFM imaging and NMR, fluorescence, and mass spectrometry to monitor in vitro how Abeta aggregation is affected by the cigarette-related compounds nicotine, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with one to five aromatic rings, and the metal ions Cd(II), Cr(III), Pb(II), and Pb(IV). All PAHs and metal ions modulated the Abeta aggregation process. Cd(II), Cr(III), and Pb(II) ions displayed general electrostatic interactions with Abeta, whereas Pb(IV) ions showed specific transient binding coordination to the N-terminal Abeta segment. Thus, Pb(IV) ions are especially prone to interact with Abeta and affect its aggregation. While Pb(IV) ions affected mainly Abeta dimer and trimer formation, hydrophobic toluene mainly affected formation of larger aggregates such as tetramers. The uncharged and hydrophilic nicotine molecule showed no direct interactions with Abeta, nor did it affect Abeta aggregation. Our Abeta interaction results suggest a molecular rationale for the higher AD prevalence among smokers, and indicate that certain forms of lead in particular may constitute an environmental risk factor for AD.",

Considerable evidence has suggested that amyloid beta (Abeta), a secreted proteolytic derivative of amyloid precursor protein, appears to be a critical factor in the early 'synaptic failure' that is observed in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. The identification of Abeta at neuronal spines with high spatial resolution and high surface specificity would facilitate unraveling the intricate effect of Abeta on synapse loss and its effect on neighboring neuronal connections. Here, tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy was used to map the presence of Abeta aggregations in the vicinity of the spines exposed to Abeta preformed in vitro. Exposure to Abeta was of 1 and 6 hours. The intensity variation of selected vibrational modes of Abeta was mapped by TERS for different exposure times to Abeta. Of interest, we discuss the distinct contributions of the amide modes from Abeta that are enhanced by the TERS process and in particular the suppression of the amide I mode in the context of recently reported observations in the literature.",

    "title": "Abeta exacerbates alpha-synuclein-induced neurotoxicity through impaired insulin signaling in alpha-synuclein-overexpressed human SK-N-MC neuronal cells.",
    "abstract": "AIM: alpha-Synuclein (alphaSyn) is known as a small soluble protein abundantly expressed in neuronal cells. Although its physiological role is still unclear, the aggregation of alphaSyn has been recognized as responsible for some neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In most cases, intracellular abnormal aggregates are caused by protein-coding mutations that alter primary structure and therefore increase propensity toward aggregation. However, no pathogenic alterations or polymorphisms in alphaSyn are found in DLB patients so far, suggesting genetic mutations may not play a major role in DLB pathogenesis. In contrast, emerging evidence reveals that amyloid beta (Abeta) may contribute to aggregate formation and exacerbate neurotoxicity of alphaSyn. However, the underlying mechanism of action has remained unclear. METHODS: To investigate molecular pathways involved in Abeta-mediated alphaSyn pathology, we established an in vitro model for inducible alphaSyn overexpression in SK-N-MC human neuronal cells. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that Abeta treatment in alphaSyn-overexpressed neuronal cells significantly increases alphaSyn intracellular aggregation and cytotoxicity. Moreover, Abeta also caused AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibition and impaired insulin sensitivity, which leads to significant downregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)/heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) antioxidant signaling to elicit alphaSyn aggregation. CONCLUSIONS: This raised the possibility that insulin resistance could be one of the causative factors of alphaSyn toxicity, and the strategies for insulin sensitization may have therapeutic potential for synucleinopathies including DLB.",

Abnormal accumulation of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm of affected neurons is a pathological hallmark of the neurodegenerative diseases frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Several transgenic mouse models have been generated that recapitulate defects in TDP-43 accumulation, thus causing neurodegeneration and behavioural impairments. While aging is the key risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, the specific effect of aging on phenotypes in TDP-43 transgenic mice has not been investigated. Here, we analyse age-dependent changes in TDP-43 transgenic mice that displayed impaired memory. We found the accumulation of abundant poly-ubiquitinated protein aggregates in the hippocampus of aged TDP-43 transgenic mice. Intriguingly, the aggregates contained some interneuron-specific proteins such as parvalbumin and calretinin, suggesting that GABAergic interneurons were degenerated in these mice. The abundance of aggregates significantly increased with age and with the overexpression of TDP-43. Gene array analyses in the hippocampus and other brain areas revealed dysregulation in genes linked to oxidative stress and neuronal function in TDP-43 transgenic mice. Our results indicate that the interneuron degeneration occurs upon aging, and TDP-43 accelerates age-dependent neuronal degeneration, which may be related to the impaired memory of TDP-43 transgenic mice.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder characterized by global cognitive impairment that involves accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) in the brain. Herbal approaches can be used as alternative medicines to slow the progression of AD. This study aimed to determine the beneficial effects and potential underlying mechanisms of total flavonoid extract from Dracoephalum moldavica L. (TFDM) for attenuating Alzheimer-related deficits induced by Abeta. MAIN METHODS: We used amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) double transgenic mice and copper-injured APP Swedish mutation overexpressing SH-SY5Y cells to evaluate the beneficial effects of TFDM. Further, identifying the mechanisms of action was conducted on anti-amyloidogenic and neurotrophic transductions. KEY FINDINGS: Our results indicated that TFDM treatment ameliorated cognitive impairments and neurodegeneration and improved the antioxidant defense system in APP/PS1 mice. TFDM also reduced Abeta burden by relieving Abeta deposition, decreasing insoluble Abeta levels, and inhibiting beta-amyloidogenic processing pathway involving downregulation of beta-secretase and beta-C-terminal fragment in the brain. In the in vitro model of AD, TFDM treatment protected injured cells, and combined with the beneficial effects of decreasing APP levels, lowered Abeta1-42 and regulated the redox imbalance. Moreover, TFDM preserved the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/cAMP response element-binding protein/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway both in vitro and in vivo. SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, TFDM clearly demonstrated neuroprotective effects by restoring the anti-amyloidogenic and neurotrophic transductions in the context of AD-associated deficits.

    "title": "Tau, amyloid, and cascading network failure across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.",
    "abstract": "Functionally related brain regions are selectively vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. However, molecular markers of this pathophysiology (i.e., beta-amyloid and tau aggregates) have discrepant spatial and temporal patterns of progression within these selectively vulnerable brain regions. Existing reductionist pathophysiologic models cannot account for these large-scale spatiotemporal inconsistencies. Within the framework of the recently proposed cascading network failure model of Alzheimer's disease, however, these large-scale patterns are to be expected. This model postulates the following: 1) a tau-associated, circumscribed network disruption occurs in brain regions specific to a given phenotype in clinically normal individuals; 2) this disruption can trigger phenotype independent, stereotypic, and amyloid-associated compensatory brain network changes indexed by changes in the default mode network; 3) amyloid deposition marks a saturation of functional compensation and portends an acceleration of the inciting phenotype specific, and tau-associated, network failure. With the advent of in vivo molecular imaging of tau pathology, combined with amyloid and functional network imaging, it is now possible to investigate the relationship between functional brain networks, tau, and amyloid across the disease spectrum within these selectively vulnerable brain regions. In a large cohort (n = 218) spanning the Alzheimer's disease spectrum from young, amyloid negative, cognitively normal subjects to Alzheimer's disease dementia, we found several distinct spatial patterns of tau deposition, including 'Braak-like' and 'non-Braak-like', across functionally related brain regions. Rather than arising focally and spreading sequentially, elevated tau signal seems to occur system-wide based on inferences made from multiple cross-sectional analyses we conducted looking at regional patterns of tau signal. Younger age-of-disease-onset was associated with 'non-Braak-like' patterns of tau, suggesting an association with atypical clinical phenotypes. As predicted by the cascading network failure model of Alzheimer's disease, we found that amyloid is a partial mediator of the relationship between functional network failure and tau deposition in functionally connected brain regions. This study implicates large-scale brain networks in the pathophysiology of tau deposition and offers support to models incorporating large-scale network physiology into disease models linking tau and amyloid, such as the cascading network failure model of Alzheimer's disease.",

Abeta is derived by sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-site secretase enzyme (BACE-1) and gamma-secretase. Proteolytic processing of APP by BACE-1 is the rate-limiting step in Abeta production, and this pathway is a prime target for AD drug development. Both APP and BACE-1 are membrane-spanning proteins, transported via secretory and endocytic pathways; and the physical interaction of APP and BACE-1 during trafficking is a key cell biological event initiating the amyloidogenic pathway. Here, we highlight recent research on intracellular trafficking/sorting of APP and BACE-1, and discuss how dysregulation of these pathways might lead to enhanced convergence of APP and BACE-1, and subsequent beta-cleavage of APP.   2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To date, AD still remains a big challenge due to no effective treatments. Based on the property that Abeta aggregates have the cross-beta-structure, a common structural feature in amyloids, we systemically designed the Abeta-aggregation inhibitor that maintains Abeta-interacting ability but removes toxic part from SOD1 (superoxide dismutase 1)-G93A. We identified NABi (Natural Abeta Binder and Abeta-aggregation inhibitor) composed of beta2-3 strands, a novel breaker of Abeta aggregation, which does not self-aggregate and has no cytotoxicity at all. The NABi blocks Abeta-fibril formation in vitro and in vivo and prevents neuronal cell death, a hallmark of AD pathogenesis. Such anti-amyloidogenic properties can provide novel strategies for treating AD. Furthermore, our study provides molecular insights into the design of amyloidogenic inhibitors to cure various neurodegenerative and amyloid-associated diseases, as NABi would regulate aggregation of other toxic beta-sheet proteins other than Abeta.",

    "title": "TRPM2 dependence of ROS-induced NLRP3 activation in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that neuroinflammation plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglial cells are responsible for the phagocytosis of Amyloid-beta (Abeta). However, it has been demonstrated that in AD patients the efficiency of phagocytosis decreases due to proinflammatory cytokines, such as Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), which is produced through the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. In this study, we aimed at deciphering the mechanism underlying the NLRP3 activation. The results showed that Abeta induces an increase in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). According to this study, ROS produced from both mitochondria and NADPH oxidase was responsible for NLRP3 activation. In addition, it was observed that this high level of ROS activated the transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel, which causes an increase in the level of intracellular calcium. The results demonstrated that in the absence of intracellular calcium, caspase-1 cannot be activated and therefore the level of IL-1beta decreases. Altogether, our findings supported the role of TRPM2 channel in ROS-induced NLRP3 activation in microglial cells through the exposure to Abeta.",

Disturbances in calcium homeostasis have been observed in various cellular and animal models of AD and are proposed to underlie the pathogenesis of the disease. Furthermore, wildtype presenilins were shown to regulate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium homeostasis, although their precise mechanism of action remains controversial. To investigate whether APP also affects ER calcium levels, we used RNA interference to target the APP gene in cultured T84 cells in combination with two types of ER calcium sensors. Using a genetically encoded calcium indicator, GEM-CEPIA1er, we found that APP-deficient cells exhibited elevated resting calcium levels in the ER and prolonged emptying of ER calcium stores upon the cyclopiazonic acid-induced inhibition of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase. These effects could be ascribed to lower ER calcium leakage rates. Consistent with these results, translocation of the endogenous ER calcium sensor STIM1 to its target channel Orai1 was delayed following ER calcium store depletion. Our data suggest a physiological function of APP in the regulation of ER calcium levels.",

    "abstract": "Despite having pathological changes in the brain associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), some patients have preserved cognitive function. A recent epidemiological study has shown that diet, exercise, cognitive training, and vascular risk monitoring interventions may reduce cognitive decline in at-risk elderly people in the general population. However, the details of molecular mechanisms underlying this cognitive function preservation are still unknown. Previous reports have demonstrated that enriched environments prevent the impairment of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) through beta2-adrenergic signals, when LTP is incompletely suppressed by synthetic amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers. The cholinergic network from the medial septal nucleus (MSN) is also a main modulating system for hippocampal glutamatergic neural activation through nicotinergic and/or muscarinergic acetylcholine receptors. Previously, we reported the importance of a cholinergic regulator gene in the MSN, hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide (HCNP). By using hippocampal sections from mice, we here demonstrated that the cholinergic neural activation from the MSN enhanced the glutamatergic neuronal activity during unsaturated LTP but not during saturated LTP. Synthetic Abeta oligomers suppressed the hippocampal glutamatergic activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, HCNP, as well as a cholinergic agonist acting through the muscarinic M1 receptor, prevented the suppression of hippocampal glutamatergic neuronal activity induced by synthetic Abeta oligomers. This result suggests that the persisting cholinergic activation might be a potential explanation for the individual differences in cognitive effects of AD pathological changes.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral beta-amyloidosis is a major feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by the accumulation of beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) in the brain. Several studies have implicated lipid/lipoprotein metabolism in the regulation of beta-amyloidosis. In this regard, HDL (High Density Lipoprotein)-based therapies could ameliorate pathological features associated with AD. As apolipoprotein J (ApoJ) is a natural chaperone that interacts with Abeta, avoiding its aggregation and toxicity, in this study we propose to prepare reconstituted rHDL-rApoJ nanoparticles by assembling phospholipids with recombinant human ApoJ (rApoJ). Hence, rHDL particles were prepared using the cholate dialysis method and characterized by N-PAGE, dynamic light scattering, circular dichroism and electron transmission microscopy. The preparation of rHDL particles showed two-sized populations with discoidal shape. Functionally, rHDL-rApoJ maintained the ability to prevent the Abeta fibrillization and mediated a higher cholesterol efflux from cultured macrophages. Fluorescently-labelled rHDL-rApoJ nanoparticles were intravenously administrated in mice and their distribution over time was determined using an IVIS Xenogen  imager. It was confirmed that rHDL-rApoJ accumulated in the cranial region, especially in old transgenic mice presenting a high cerebral Abeta load. In conclusion, we have standardized a reproducible protocol to produce rHDL-rApoJ nanoparticles, which may be potentially considered as a therapeutic option for beta-amyloid-related pathologies.",

    "abstract": "The trafficking behavior of the lipid raft-dwelling US9 protein from Herpes Simplex Virus strikingly overlaps with that of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Both US9 and APP processing machinery rely on their ability to shuttle between endosomes and plasma membranes, as well as on their lateral accumulation in lipid rafts. Therefore, repurposing US9 to track/modify these molecular events represents a valid approach to investigate pathological states including Alzheimer's disease and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders where APP misprocessing to amyloid beta formation has been observed. Accordingly, we investigated the cellular localization of US9-driven cargo in neurons and created a US9-driven functional assay based on the exogenous enzymatic activity of Tobacco Etch Virus Protease. Our results demonstrate that US9 can direct and control cleavage of recombinant proteins exposed on the luminal leaflet of transport vesicles. Furthermore, we confirmed that US9 is associated with lipid-rafts and can target functional enzymes to membrane microdomains where pathologic APP-processing is thought to occur. Overall, our results suggest strongly that US9 can serve as a molecular driver that targets functional cargos to the APP machinery and can be used as a tool to study the contribution of lipid rafts to neurodegenerative disease conditions where amyloidogenesis has been implicated.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic dysfunction due to the disrupting binding of amyloid beta (Abeta) and tau oligomers is one of the earliest impairments in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), driving initial cognitive deficits and clinical manifestation. Consequently, there is ample consensus that preventing early synaptic dysfunction would be an effective therapeutic strategy for AD. With this goal in mind, we investigated the effect of a treatment of mice with near infrared (NIR) light on synaptic vulnerability to Abeta oligomers. We found that Abeta oligomer binding to CNS synaptosomes isolated from wild type (wt) mice treated with NIR light was significantly reduced and the resulting suppression of long term potentiation (LTP) by Abeta oligomers was prevented. Similarly, APP transgenic mice treated with NIR showed a significant reduction of endogenous Abeta at CNS synapses. We further found that these phenomena were accompanied by increased synaptic mitochondrial membrane potential in both wt and Tg2576 mice. This study provides evidence that NIR light can effectively reduce synaptic vulnerability to damaging Abeta oligomers, thus furthering NIR light therapy as a viable treatment for AD.",

Treatments targeting specific pathologies such as amyloid beta in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not led to effective treatments, and there is increasing evidence of a disconnect between traditional pathology and cognitive abilities with advancing age, indicative of individual variation in resilience to pathology. Here, we generated a comprehensive neuropathological, molecular, and transcriptomic characterization of hippocampus and two regions cortex in 107 aged donors (median = 90) from the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study as a freely-available resource (http://aging.brain-map.org/). We confirm established associations between AD pathology and dementia, albeit with increased, presumably aging-related variability, and identify sets of co-expressed genes correlated with pathological tau and inflammation markers. Finally, we demonstrate a relationship between dementia and RNA quality, and find common gene signatures, highlighting the importance of properly controlling for RNA quality when studying dementia.",

Furthermore, it contributes to glutamatergic regulation and synaptic plasticity. Emerging evidence also suggests that tau serves as a signaling scaffold. Tau function and subcellular localization are tightly regulated, in part, by the orchestrated interplay between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. Significantly, protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A), encompassing the regulatory PPP2R2A (or Balpha) subunit, is a major brain heterotrimeric enzyme and the primary tau Ser/Thr phosphatase in vivo. Herein, we closely examine how the intimate and compartmentalized interactions between PP2A and tau regulate tau phosphorylation and function, and play an essential role in neuronal homeostasis. We also review evidence supporting a strong link between deregulation of tau-PP2A functional interactions and the molecular underpinnings of various neurodegenerative diseases collectively called tauopathies. Lastly, we discuss the opportunities and associated challenges in more specifically targeting PP2A-tau interactions for drug development for tauopathies.",

We describe the assessment of circulating brain-enriched microRNAs as potential biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS: In this case-control study, the plasma samples were collected from 250 research participants with a clinical diagnosis of AD, FTD, PD, and ALS, as well as from age- and sex-matched control subjects (n = 50 for each group), recruited from 2003 to 2015 at the University of Pennsylvania Health System, including the Alzheimer's Disease Center, the Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Center, the Frontotemporal Degeneration Center, and the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Clinic. Each group was randomly divided into training and confirmation sets of equal size. To evaluate the potential of circulating microRNAs enriched in specific brain regions affected by NDs and present in synapses as biomarkers of NDs, the levels of 37 brain-enriched and inflammation-associated microRNAs in the plasma of all participants were measured using individual qRT-PCR. A \"microRNA pair\" approach was used for data normalization. RESULTS: MicroRNA pairs and their combinations (classifiers) capable of differentiating NDs from control and from each other were defined using independently and jointly analyzed training and confirmation datasets. AD, PD, FTD, and ALS are differentiated from control with accuracy of 0.89, 0.90, 0.88, and 0.83 (AUCs, 0.96, 0.96, 0.94, and 0.93), respectively; NDs are differentiated from each other with accuracy ranging from 0.77 (AUC, 0.87) for AD vs. FTD to 0.93 (AUC, 0.98) for AD vs. ALS. The data further indicate sex dependence of some microRNA markers. The average increase in accuracy in distinguishing ND from control for all and male/female groups is 0.06; the largest increase is for ALS, from 0.83 for all participants to 0.92/0.98 for male/female participants. CONCLUSIONS: The work presented here suggests the possibility of developing microRNA-based diagnostics for detection and differentiation of NDs. Larger multicenter clinical studies are needed to further evaluate circulating brain-enriched microRNAs as biomarkers for NDs and to investigate their association with other ND biomarkers in clinical trial settings.",

    "abstract": "We previously demonstrated that oligomeric amyloid beta42 (oAbeta42) inhibits the mevalonate pathway impairing cholesterol synthesis and protein prenylation. Enzymes of the mevalonate pathway are regulated by the transcription factor SREBP-2. Here, we show that in several neuronal types challenged with oAbeta42, SREBP-2 activation is reduced. Moreover, SREBP-2 activation is also decreased in the brain cortex of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model, TgCRND8, suggesting that SREBP-2 may be affected in vivo early in the disease. We demonstrate that oAbeta42 does not affect enzymatic cleavage of SREBP-2 per se, but may impair SREBP-2 transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi. Trafficking of SREBP-2 from the ER to the Golgi requires protein kinase B (Akt) activation. oAbeta42 significantly reduces Akt phosphorylation and this decrease is responsible for the decline in SREBP-2 activation. Overexpression of constitutively active Akt prevents the effect of oAbeta42 on SREBP-2 and the downstream inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and protein prenylation. Our work provides a novel mechanistic link between Abeta and the mevalonate pathway, which will impact the views on issues related to cholesterol, isoprenoids, and statins in AD. We also identify SREBP-2 as an indirect target of Akt in neurons, which may play a role in the cross-talk between AD and diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Patients recovering from sepsis have higher rates of CNS morbidities associated with long-lasting impairment of cognitive functions, including neurodegenerative diseases. However, the molecular etiology of these sepsis-induced impairments is unclear. Here, we investigated the role of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration-associated changes, and cognitive dysfunction arising after sepsis recovery. Adult Wistar rats underwent cecal ligation and perforation (CLP), and serum and brain (hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) samples were obtained at days 1, 15, and 30 after the CLP. We examined these samples for systemic and brain inflammation; amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and Ser-202-phosphorylated Tau (p-TauSer-202) levels; and RAGE, RAGE ligands, and RAGE intracellular signaling. Serum markers associated with the acute proinflammatory phase of sepsis (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6) rapidly increased and then progressively decreased during the 30-day period post-CLP, concomitant with a progressive increase in RAGE ligands (S100B, Nepsilon-[carboxymethyl]lysine, HSP70, and HMGB1). In the brain, levels of RAGE and Toll-like receptor 4, glial fibrillary acidic protein and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase, and Abeta and p-TauSer-202 also increased during that time. Of note, intracerebral injection of RAGE antibody into the hippocampus at days 15, 17, and 19 post-CLP reduced Abeta and p-TauSer-202 accumulation, Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling, levels of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein, and behavioral deficits associated with cognitive decline. These results indicate that brain RAGE is an essential factor in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders following acute systemic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid positron emission tomography ([18F] florbetaben (FBB) PET) can be used to determine concomitant Alzheimer's disease (AD) in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) patients. FBB PET scans and the tap test were performed in 31 patients with clinically suspected iNPH, and amyloid positive (iNPH/FBB+) and negative (iNPH/FBB-) groups were compared with respect to clinical characteristics. We evaluated prognostic value of FBB PET scans by analyzing the response to the tap test using a linear mixed model. We also performed a multivariable regression analysis to investigate whether amyloid PET positivity can predict the positive tap test response independent of other AD biomarkers. The results showed that the iNPH/FBB+ group (7/31, 22.6%) had a higher percentage of APOE4 carriers, lower Abeta42, higher CSF t-tau, and p-tau/Abeta42 ratio than the iNPH/FBB- group (24/31, 77.4%), while the two groups did not differ in imaging characteristics. The iNPH/FBB- group had a higher percentage of tap responders and showed a greater improvement in gait scores after the tap test than the iNPH/FBB+ group (group-tap test effect interaction, p = 0.035). A multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that amyloid positivity on PET scans (OR 0.03, p = 0.029) and CSF p-tau (OR 0.87, p = 0.044) were independently associated with the positive tap test response. Among 21 tap responders in the iNPH/FBB- group, 14 patients received shunt surgery and 12/14 (85.7%) patients showed symptom improvement. Our findings suggest that amyloid PET scans can help determine which iNPH patients will benefit from shunt surgery by discriminating concomitant AD.",

    "abstract": "Memory impairment by the Amyloid-beta 25-35 (Abeta25-35) peptide in animal models has provided an understanding of the causes behind the similar deterioration that occurs in Alzheimer's disease. However, it is uncertain if a decrease of dendritic spines and neurogenesis conduces to cognitive impairment by an impairment in the retrieval of stored memory. The aim of this study was to evaluate the consequences of impairment on spatial memory caused by the administration of the Abeta25-35 peptide in the hippocampus, which is associated whit morphological changes and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG). The vehicle or Abeta25-35 peptide (0.1mug/muL) were bilaterally administered in the CA1 subfield of the rat hippocampus. The animals were tested for spatial learning and memory in the Morris Water Maze. In the day's 11, 18 and 32 after administration of the Abeta25-35 peptide were examined the morphological changes in the DG using a Golgi-Cox stain. In the day 32, the neurogenesis was evaluated by the immunoreactivity to 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU; 100mg/kg, i.p.) that corresponding to cellular proliferation post damage, the neuronal specific nuclear protein (NeuN) and doublecortin (DCX). This study found a memory retrieval impairment occurring at day 17, a cognitive deficit which had increased significantly at day 31 after the administration of Abeta25-35 peptide. These results are related to morphological changes in the granular cells of the DG, such as a shorter dendritic length and a decrease in the number of dendritic spines. In neurogenesis, the total number of cells positive to BrdU, NeuN and DCX in the hippocampal granule cell layer was found to have declined in animals treated with Abeta25-35. The results suggest that the Abeta25-35 peptide impairs memory retrieval by decreasing the number of dendritic spines and altering neurogenesis in the DG.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: A reduction in glucose metabolism in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) predicts conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and tracks disease progression, signifying its importance in AD. We aimed to use decline in PCC glucose metabolism as a proxy for the development and progression of AD to discover common genetic variants associated with disease vulnerability. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of decline in PCC fludeoxyglucose F 18 ([18 F] FDG) positron emission tomography measured in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants (n = 606). We then performed follow-up analyses to assess the impact of significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on disease risk and longitudinal cognitive performance in a large independent data set (n = 870). Last, we assessed whether significant SNP influence gene expression using two RNA sequencing data sets (n = 210 and n = 159). RESULTS: We demonstrate a novel genome-wide significant association between rs2273647-T in the gene, PPP4R3A, and reduced [18 F] FDG decline (p = 4.44 x 10-8 ). In a follow-up analysis using an independent data set, we demonstrate a protective effect of this variant against risk of conversion to MCI or AD (p = 0.038) and against cognitive decline in individuals who develop dementia (p = 3.41 x 10-15 ). Furthermore, this variant is associated with altered gene expression in peripheral blood and altered PPPP4R3A transcript expression in temporal cortex, suggesting a role at the molecular level. INTERPRETATIONS: PPP4R3A is a gene involved in AD risk and progression. Given the protective effect of this variant, PPP4R3A should be further investigated as a gene of interest in neurodegenerative diseases and as a potential target for AD therapies.

    "abstract": "Endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) is an important protein quality control system which maintains protein homeostasis. Constituents of the ERAD complex and its role in neurodegeneration are not yet fully understood. Here, using proteomic and FRET analyses, we demonstrate that the ER protein membralin is an ERAD component, which mediates degradation of ER luminal and membrane substrates. Interestingly, we identify nicastrin, a key component of the gamma-secretase complex, as a membralin binding protein and membralin-associated ERAD substrate. We demonstrate a reduction of membralin mRNA and protein levels in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, the latter of which inversely correlates with nicastrin abundance. Furthermore, membralin deficiency enhances gamma-secretase activity and neuronal degeneration. In a mouse AD model, downregulating membralin results in beta-amyloid pathology, neuronal death, and exacerbates synaptic/memory deficits. Our results identify membralin as an ERAD component and demonstrate a critical role for ERAD in AD pathogenesis.",

We evaluated 12 unstained frontal cortex and hippocampus samples from 3 brain donors with Alzheimer's disease and 1 control with hyperspectral Raman microscopy on samples of 30 x 30 microm. Data matrices of 64 x 64 pixels were used to quantify different tissue components including proteins, lipids, water and beta-sheets for imaging at 0.47 microm spatial resolution. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to visualize regions with high Raman spectral similarities. The Raman images of proteins, lipids, water and beta-sheets matched with classical brain morphology. Protein content was 2.0 times, the beta-sheet content 5.6 times and Raman broad-band autofluorescence was 2.4 times higher inside the plaques and tangles than in the surrounding tissue. The lipid content was practically equal inside and outside. Broad-band autofluorescence showed some correlation with protein content and a better correlation with beta-sheet content. Hyperspectral Raman imaging combined with hierarchical cluster analysis allows for the identification of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in unstained, label-free slices of human Alzheimer's disease brain tissue. It permits simultaneous quantification and distinction of several tissue components such as proteins, lipids, water and beta-sheets.",

Methods: We applied mathematical modeling to Abeta in vivo PET imaging data to investigate competing theories of Abeta spread in AD. Results: Our results provided evidence that Abeta accumulation starts in all brain regions simultaneously and that its spatiotemporal distribution is due to heterogeneous regional carrying capacities (regional maximum possible concentration of Abeta) for the aggregated protein rather than to longer-term spreading from seed regions. Conclusion: The in vivo spatiotemporal distribution of Abeta in AD can be mathematically modeled using a logistic growth model in which the Abeta carrying capacity is heterogeneous across the brain but the exponential growth rate and time of half maximal Abeta concentration are constant.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing by alpha- and beta-secretases is of special interest to Alzheimer's disease (AD), as these proteases prevent or mediate amyloid beta formation, respectively. Neuroinflammation is also implicated in AD. Our data demonstrate that the endogenous mediator of inflammation prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) promotes full-length APP (FL-APP) processing by alpha- and beta-secretases. The decrease in FL-APP was independent of proteasomal, lysosomal, calpain, caspase, and gamma-secretase activities. Moreover, PGJ2-treatment promoted cleavage of secreted APP, specifically sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta, generated by alpha and beta-secretase, respectively. Notably, PGJ2-treatment induced caspase-dependent cleavage of sAPPbeta. Mechanistically, PGJ2-treatment selectively diminished mature (O- and N-glycosylated) but not immature (N-glycosylated only) FL-APP. PGJ2-treatment also increased the overall levels of protein O-GlcNAcylation, which occurs within the nucleocytoplasmic compartment. It is known that APP undergoes O-GlcNAcylation and that the latter protects proteins from proteasomal degradation. Our results suggest that by increasing protein O-GlcNAcylation levels, PGJ2 renders mature APP less prone to proteasomal degradation, thus shunting APP toward processing by alpha- and beta-secretases.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To improve our understanding of early beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation processes using florbetapir-PET scan in 20- to 60-year-old individuals. METHODS: Seventy-six cognitively normal individuals aged 20 to 60 years, 57 cognitively normal older individuals (61-84 years old), and 70 patients with mild cognitive impairment or probable Alzheimer disease (AD) underwent a florbetapir-PET scan. Images were spatially normalized and scaled using the whole cerebellum. The relationship with age was assessed on the mean neocortical standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and voxelwise in the younger group to assess early Abeta accumulation processes. To compare the topography of early-age-related vs AD-related changes, Abeta increase in patients vs cognitively normal older adults was also assessed. RESULTS: A linear increase of Abeta deposition from 20 to 60 years old was found on the mean neocortical SUVR, and more specifically on the temporal neocortex. By contrast, increase in patients predominated in frontal and medial parietal areas. The temporal increase in healthy participants was still significant when including only the 20- to 50-year-old individuals and controlling for several possible methodologic confounds. CONCLUSIONS: Florbetapir binding increases linearly from 20 to 60 years old in the temporal lobe. Pending replication, including with other PET tracers, this study suggests that the well-described medial frontal and parietal accumulation in late adulthood and AD might superimpose to a physiologic accumulation of Abeta, starting from young adulthood, in temporal lobes.",

    "abstract": "Blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown has been determined to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms of BBB disruption in AD remain unclear. Our previous study suggested that the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) functioned as a signal transduction receptor in Abeta1-42-induced damage in endothelial cells. In our present study, we revealed that RAGE-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is essential for Abeta-induced endothelial cell damage. Here, we found that Abeta1-42 activated ERS by upregulation of Grp78, xbp-1 and CHOP in endothelial cells and that Abeta1-42-resulted lesions, including the upregulations of caspase-12 and caspase-3, the augment of bax/bcl-2 ratio, and the downregulations of ZO-1 and Occludin in bEnd.3 cells, were ameliorated by the pretreatment of salubrinal, an ERS inhibitor. Furthermore, the expressions of Grp78, xbp-1 and CHOP induced by Abeta1-42 were blocked by transfection of RAGE small interfering RNA (siRNA), which indicated that Abeta1-42 activated ERS in a RAGE-dependent manner. Additionally, bEnd.3 cells transfected with RAGE siRNA showed lower expressions of caspase-12 and caspase-3, decreased bax/bcl-2 ratio, and higher expressions of ZO-1 and Occludin following Abeta1-42 treatment, comparing to control cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that Abeta1-42 induced endothelial cells damage via activation of ERS in a RAGE-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Chronic arsenic exposure during development is associated with alterations of chemical transmission and demyelination, which result in cognitive deficits and peripheral neuropathies. At the cellular level, arsenic toxicity involves increased generation of reactive species that induce severe cellular alterations such as DNA fragmentation, apoptosis, and lipid peroxidation. It has been proposed that arsenic-associated neurodegeneration could evolve to Alzheimer disease in later life.1,2 In this study, the effects of chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic (3 ppm by drinking water) in Wistar rats on the production and elimination of Amyloid-beta (Abeta) were evaluated. Male Wistar rats were exposed to 3 ppm of arsenic in drinking water from fetal development until 4 months of age. After behavioral deficits induced by arsenic exposure through contextual fear conditioning were verified, the brains were collected for the determination of total arsenic by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, the levels of amyloid precursor protein and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) by Western blot analysis as well as their transcript levels by RT-qPCR, Abeta(1-42) estimation by ELISA assay and the enzymatic activity of beta-secretase (BACE1). Our results demonstrate that chronic arsenic exposure induces behavioral deficits accompanied of higher levels of soluble and membranal RAGE and the increase of Abeta(1-42) cleaved. In addition, BACE1 enzymatic activity was increased, while immunoblot assays showed no differences in the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) receptor among groups. These results provide evidence of the effects of arsenic exposure on the production of Abeta(1-42) and cerebral amyloid clearance through RAGE in an in vivo model that displays behavioral alterations. This work supports the hypothesis that early exposure to metals may contribute to neurodegeneration associated with amyloid accumulation.",

Nevertheless, the genetic and biomarker profiles of SCD individuals remain mostly unexplored. METHODS: We evaluated apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4's effect in the risk of presenting SCD, using the Fundacio ACE Healthy Brain Initiative (FACEHBI) SCD cohort and Spanish controls, and performed a meta-analysis addressing the same question. We assessed the relationship between APOE dosage and brain amyloid burden in the FACEHBI SCD and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohorts. RESULTS: Analysis of the FACEHBI cohort and the meta-analysis demonstrated SCD individuals presented higher allelic frequencies of APOE epsilon4 with respect to controls. APOE dosage explained 9% (FACEHBI cohort) and 11% (FACEHBI and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohorts) of the variance of cerebral amyloid levels. DISCUSSION: The FACEHBI sample presents APOE epsilon4 enrichment, suggesting that a pool of AD patients is nested in our sample. Cerebral amyloid levels are partially explained by the APOE allele dosage, suggesting that other genetic or epigenetic factors are involved in this AD endophenotype.",

    "title": "Amyloid polymorphisms constitute distinct clouds of conformational variants in different etiological subtypes of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "The molecular architecture of amyloids formed in vivo can be interrogated using luminescent conjugated oligothiophenes (LCOs), a unique class of amyloid dyes. When bound to amyloid, LCOs yield fluorescence emission spectra that reflect the 3D structure of the protein aggregates. Given that synthetic amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) has been shown to adopt distinct structural conformations with different biological activities, we asked whether Abeta can assume structurally and functionally distinct conformations within the brain. To this end, we analyzed the LCO-stained cores of beta-amyloid plaques in postmortem tissue sections from frontal, temporal, and occipital neocortices in 40 cases of familial Alzheimer's disease (AD) or sporadic (idiopathic) AD (sAD). The spectral attributes of LCO-bound plaques varied markedly in the brain, but the mean spectral properties of the amyloid cores were generally similar in all three cortical regions of individual patients. Remarkably, the LCO amyloid spectra differed significantly among some of the familial and sAD subtypes, and between typical patients with sAD and those with posterior cortical atrophy AD. Neither the amount of Abeta nor its protease resistance correlated with LCO spectral properties. LCO spectral amyloid phenotypes could be partially conveyed to Abeta plaques induced by experimental transmission in a mouse model. These findings indicate that polymorphic Abeta-amyloid deposits within the brain cluster as clouds of conformational variants in different AD cases. Heterogeneity in the molecular architecture of pathogenic Abeta among individuals and in etiologically distinct subtypes of AD justifies further studies to assess putative links between Abeta conformation and clinical phenotype.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by amyloid-beta (Abeta) is considered to be one of mechanisms underlying the development of Alzheimer's disease. Curcumin can attenuate Abeta-induced neurotoxicity through ROS scavenging, but the protective effect of intracellular curcumin on neurocyte membranes against extracellular Abeta may be compromised. To address this issue, we synthesized a palmitic acid curcumin ester (P-curcumin) which can be cultivated on the cell membrane and investigated the neuroprotective effect of P-curcumin and its interaction with Abeta. METHODS: P-curcumin was prepared through chemical synthesis. Its structure was determined via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). An MTT assay was used to assess Abeta cytotoxicity and the protective effect of P-curcumin on SH-SY5Y cells. The effect of P-curcumin on Abeta-induced ROS production in vitro and in vivo were assessed based on changes in dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence. A spectrophotometric method was employed to detect lipid peroxidation. To mimic the interaction of P-curcumin on cell membranes with Abeta, liposomes were prepared by thin film method. Finally, the interactions between free P-curcumin and P-curcumin cultivated on liposomes and Abeta were determined via spectrophotometry. RESULTS: A novel derivative, palmitic acid curcumin ester was prepared and characterized. This curcumin, cultivated on the membranes of neurocytes, may prevent Abeta-mediated ROS production and may inhibit the direct interaction between Abeta and the cellular membrane. Furthermore, P-curcumin could scavenge Abeta-mediated ROS as curcumin in vitro and in vivo, and had the potential to prevent lipid peroxidation. Morphological analyses showed that P-curcumin was better than curcumin at protecting cell shape. To examine P-curcumin's ability to attenuate direct interaction between Abeta and cell membranes, the binding affinity of Abeta to curcumin and P-curcumin was determined. The association constants for free P-curcumin and curcumin were 7.66 x 104 M-1 and 7.61 x 105 M-1, respectively. In the liposome-trapped state, the association constants were 3.71 x 105 M-1 for P-curcumin and 1.44x 106 M-1 for curcumin. With this data, the thermodynamic constants of P-curcumin association with soluble Abeta (DeltaH, DeltaS, and DeltaG) were also determined. CONCLUSION: Cultivated curcumin weakened the direct interaction between Abeta and cell membranes and showed greater neuroprotective effects against Abeta insult than free curcumin.",

    "abstract": "High levels (muM) of beta amyloid (Abeta) oligomers are known to trigger neurotoxic effects, leading to synaptic impairment, behavioral deficits, and apoptotic cell death. The hydrophobic C-terminal domain of Abeta, together with sequences critical for oligomer formation, is essential for this neurotoxicity. However, Abeta at low levels (pM-nM) has been shown to function as a positive neuromodulator and this activity resides in the hydrophilic N-terminal domain of Abeta. An N-terminal Abeta fragment (1-15/16), found in cerebrospinal fluid, was also shown to be a highly active neuromodulator and to reverse Abeta-induced impairments of long-term potentiation. Here, we show the impact of this N-terminal Abeta fragment and a shorter hexapeptide core sequence in the Abeta fragment (Abetacore: 10-15) to protect or reverse Abeta-induced neuronal toxicity, fear memory deficits and apoptotic death. The neuroprotective effects of the N-terminal Abeta fragment and Abetacore on Abeta-induced changes in mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and apoptotic neuronal death were demonstrated via mitochondrial membrane potential, live reactive oxygen species, DNA fragmentation and cell survival assays using a model neuroblastoma cell line (differentiated NG108-15) and mouse hippocampal neuron cultures. The protective action of the N-terminal Abeta fragment and Abetacore against spatial memory processing deficits in amyloid precursor protein/PSEN1 (5XFAD) mice was demonstrated in contextual fear conditioning. Stabilized derivatives of the N-terminal Abetacore were also shown to be fully protective against Abeta-triggered oxidative stress. Together, these findings indicate an endogenous neuroprotective role for the N-terminal Abeta fragment, while active stabilized N-terminal Abetacore derivatives offer the potential for therapeutic application.",

    "abstract": "Neuropathological and in vivo brain imaging studies agree that the cornu ammonis 1 and subiculum subfields of the hippocampus are most vulnerable to atrophy in the prodromal phases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there has been limited investigation of the structural integrity of the components of the hippocampal circuit, including subfields and extra-hippocampal white matter structure, in relation to the progression of well-accepted cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD, amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta) and total-tau (tau). We investigated these relationships in 88 aging asymptomatic individuals with a parental or multiple-sibling familial history of AD. Apolipoprotein (APOE) e4 risk allele carriers were identified, and all participants underwent cognitive testing, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture for CSF assays of tau, phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) and Abeta. Individuals with a reduction in CSF Abeta levels (an indicator of amyloid accretion into neuritic plaques) as well as evident tau pathology (believed to be linked to neurodegeneration) exhibited lower subiculum volume, lower fornix microstructural integrity, and a trend towards lower cognitive score than individuals who showed only reduction in CSF Abeta. In contrast, persons with normal levels of tau showed an increase in structural MR markers in relation to declining levels of CSF Abeta. These results suggest that hippocampal subfield volume and extra-hippocampal white matter microstructure demonstrate a complex pattern where an initial volume increase is followed by decline among asymptomatic individuals who, in some instances, may be a decade or more away from onset of cognitive or functional impairment.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) oligomers are emerging as potent neurotoxic species in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Detailed characterization of oligomer structure and dynamics is necessary to develop oligomer-specific therapeutic agents. However, oligomers exist transiently, which complicates their structural analysis. One approach to mitigate these problems has been photochemical cross-linking of native oligomers. In these states, the oligomers can be isolated and purified for physical and chemical studies. Here we characterized the structure of isolated cross-linked Abeta42 trimers, pentamers, and heptamers with atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging and probed their dynamics in solution using time-lapse high-speed AFM. This technique enables visualization of the structural dynamics of the oligomers at nanometer resolution on a millisecond time scale. Results demonstrate that cross-linked pentamers and heptamers are very dynamic fluctuating between a compact single-globular and multiglobular assemblies. Trimers remain in their single-globular geometry that elongates adopting an ellipsoidal shape. Biological significance of oligomers dynamics is discussed.",

    "title": "Distinct patterns of amyloid-dependent tau accumulation in Lewy body diseases.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In addition to Lewy body pathology, amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that are characteristic for Alzheimer's disease are also frequently found in Lewy body diseases. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to investigate tau accumulation patterns in dementia with Lewy bodies and other Lewy body diseases using in vivo 18 F-AV-1451 PET. METHODS: The study included 12 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with normal cognition, 22 PD patients with cognitive impairment, and 18 dementia with Lewy bodies patients. In addition, 25 Alzheimer's disease patients and 25 healthy controls were included for comparison. All participants underwent 18 F-AV-1451 and 18 F-florbetaben PET scans, and cortical binding values were compared between the controls and each disease group. RESULTS: When compared with the controls, dementia with Lewy bodies patients showed slightly increased 18 F-AV-1451 binding in the primary sensorimotor and visual cortices and the parieto-temporal cortices, which failed to survive multiple comparisons. Amyloid-positive dementia with Lewy bodies patients showed significantly increased binding in the same regions when compared with controls, and even greater binding in the primary sensorimotor and visual cortices than Alzheimer's disease. Meanwhile, binding in the lateral and medial temporal cortices was less prominent than in Alzheimer's disease. In dementia with Lewy bodies, 18 F-AV-1451 binding in the occipital cortex correlated with 18 F-florbetaben binding. Amyloid-negative patients with normal cognition, patients with cognitive impairment, and dementia with Lewy bodies patients did not show increased 18 F-AV-1451 binding. CONCLUSIONS: Dementia with Lewy bodies patients may harbor 18 F-AV-1451 binding patterns distinct from Alzheimer's disease, with greater involvement of the primary cortices and less involvement of the temporal cortex. Tau burden increases in the Lewy body disease spectrum, and amyloid may play an important role in the accumulation of neocortical tau in Lewy body diseases.   2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

The biological screening results indicated that most compounds displayed potent inhibitory activity for Abeta (1-42) self-aggregation, and obvious selective inhibition to MAO-B. Among these compounds, compound 6e was the most potent inhibitor not only for hMAO-B (IC50 = 1.14 muM) but also for Abeta (1-42) self-aggregation (58.9% at 20 muM). Molecular modeling and kinetic studies revealed that compound 6e was a competitive MAO-B inhibitor, which can occupy the active site of MAO-B, and interact with Abeta (1-42) via pi-pi and cation-pi stacking interactions. In addition, compound 6e had no toxicity on PC12 cells and could cross the BBB. Collectively, all these results suggested that compound 6e might be a promising multi-target lead compound worthy of further investigation.",

    "abstract": "The effect of the saturation of fatty acid (FA) in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocoline (DMPC)/FA membrane on the interaction between lipid membrane and amyloid beta monomer was investigated by using the Langmuir monolayer technique. The surface pressure (Pi)-mean molecular area (A) isotherms and fluorescent measurements reveal that DMPC and octadecanoic acid (stearic acid, SA) molecules were somewhat miscible in the mixed membrane, which was maintained to homogeneous gel phase by enhance of the intermolecular hydrophobic interactions because of the all trans acyl chains. On the other hand, DMPC and 9Z,12Z-octadecadienoic acid (linoleic acid, LA) molecules were considered to be well miscible in the mixed membrane, where the membrane partially transferred from gel phase to liquid-crystalline phase. The Pi-A isotherms of the monolayers on amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) solution indicated that Abeta monomers tend to be inserted into the saturated acyl chain region of monolayers at low surface pressure and that the Abeta monomers were then extruded from the monolayer at higher surface pressure. It was observed that behaviors of Abeta monomers at higher surface pressure depended on membrane microstructures. In the DMPC/SA monolayers, Abeta aggregated and then was extruded from monolayers at about 20 mN m-1 of surface pressure irrespective of the SA proportion. On the other hand, in the DMPC/LA monolayers, Abeta, which favors to interact with DMPC, is dispersed in the monolayer even at high surface pressure because DMPC and LA molecules were well miscible in the monolayer.",

Here, we evaluated whether a recently validated polygenic hazard score (PHS) can be integrated with known in vivo cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers of amyloid, and CSF tau pathology to prospectively predict cognitive and clinical decline in 347 cognitive normal (CN; baseline age range = 59.7-90.1, 98.85% white) and 599 mild cognitively impaired (MCI; baseline age range = 54.4-91.4, 98.83% white) individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1, GO, and 2. We further investigated the association of PHS with post-mortem amyloid load and neurofibrillary tangles in the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort (N = 485, age at death range = 71.3-108.3). In CN and MCI individuals, we found that amyloid and total tau positivity systematically varies as a function of PHS. For individuals in greater than the 50th percentile PHS, the positive predictive value for amyloid approached 100%; for individuals in less than the 25th percentile PHS, the negative predictive value for total tau approached 85%. High PHS individuals with amyloid and tau pathology showed the steepest longitudinal cognitive and clinical decline, even among APOE epsilon4 noncarriers. Among the CN subgroup, we similarly found that PHS was strongly associated with amyloid positivity and the combination of PHS and biomarker status significantly predicted longitudinal clinical progression. In the ROSMAP cohort, higher PHS was associated with higher post-mortem amyloid load and neurofibrillary tangles, even in APOE epsilon4 noncarriers. Together, our results show that even after accounting for APOE epsilon4 effects, PHS may be useful in MCI and preclinical AD therapeutic trials to enrich for biomarker-positive individuals at highest risk for short-term clinical progression.",

    "abstract": "Amyloidogenic peptide fragment KLVFF (H2 N-Lys-Leu-Val-Phe-Phe-COOH, Abeta16-20 ), the core-sequence of the polypeptide Abeta40, is a well-studied model for amyloid formation. However, due to its low crystallinity, detailed atomic information of KLVFF structure is lacking. Here we report the high-resolution single-crystal X-ray structure of two monohalogenated KLVFF derivatives, KLVFF(I) and KLVFF(Br). The obtained results highlight how halogenation is a good strategy to promote crystallization and facilitate the phase determination of KLVFF(I) and KLVFF(Br) fragments. Detailed structural studies on the packing features of both monohalogenated derivatives reveal the role of the halogen atoms showing that when they are positioned on the Phe aromatic moiety at the C-terminus they do not form halogen bonds and thus do not produce any extra stabilization of the beta-sheet in the self-assembly process. The structural evidences gained from these studies corroborate the various polymorphic nanostructures of the halogenated variants of KLVFF and confirm the possibility to use halogenation as innovative strategy to tune the morphology of this pentapeptide.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Elevated total plasma homocysteine is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and there is some evidence that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) can modulate the effects of homocysteine-lowering B vitamins on AD related pathologies. Hence we investigated the relationship between total plasma homocysteine and cortical beta-amyloid (Abeta) in older adults at risk of dementia. The role of erythrocyte membrane n-3 PUFAs (omega 3 index) on this relationship was also explored. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study using data from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT); a randomised controlled trial. SETTING: French community dwellers aged 70 or over reporting subjective memory complaints, but free from a diagnosis of clinical dementia. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals were from the MAPT trial (n = 177) with data on total plasma homocysteine at baseline and cortical Abeta load. MEASUREMENTS: Cortical-to-cerebellar standard uptake value ratios were assessed using [18F] florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET). Total baseline plasma homocysteine was measured using an enzymatic cycling assay. Baseline omega 3 index was measured using gas chromatography. Cross-sectional associations were explored using adjusted multiple linear regression models. RESULTS: We found that total baseline plasma homocysteine was not significantly associated with cortical Abeta as demonstrated using multiple linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, education, cognitive status, time interval between baseline and PET-scan, omega-3 index, MAPT group allocation and Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 status (B-coefficient -0.001, 95 % CI: -0.008,0.006, p = 0.838). Exploratory analysis showed that homocysteine was however significantly associated with cortical Abeta in subjects with low baseline omega-3 index (< 4.72 %) after adjustment for Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 status (B-coefficient 0.041, 95 % CI: 0.017,0.066, p = 0.005, n = 10), but not in subjects with a high baseline omega-3 index (B-coefficient -0.010, 95 % CI: -0.023,0.003, p = 0.132, n = 66). CONCLUSIONS: The role of n-3 PUFAs on the relationship between homocysteine and cerebral Abeta warrants further investigation.",

DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study using data from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT); a randomised controlled trial. SETTING: French community dwellers aged 70 or over reporting subjective memory complaints, but free from a diagnosis of clinical dementia. PARTICIPANTS: Participants of this study were 61 individuals from the placebo arm of the MAPT trial with data on erythrocyte membrane fatty acid levels and cortical Abeta load. MEASUREMENTS: Cortical-to-cerebellar standard uptake value ratios were assessed using [18F] florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET). Fatty acids were measured in erythrocyte cell membranes using gas chromatography. Associations between erythrocyte membrane MUFAs and SFAs and cortical Abeta load were explored using adjusted multiple linear regression models and were considered significant at p <= 0.005 (10 comparisons) after correction for multiple testing. RESULTS: We found no significant associations between fatty acids and cortical Abeta load using multiple linear regression adjusted for age, sex, education, cognition, PET-scan to clinical assessment interval, PET-scan to blood collection interval and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) status. The association closest to significance was that between erythrocyte membrane stearic acid and Abeta (B-coefficient 0.03, 95 % CI: 0.00,0.05, p = 0.05). This association, although statistically non-significant, appeared to be stronger amongst ApoE epsilon4 carriers (B-coefficient 0.04, 95 % CI: -0.01,0.09, p = 0.08) compared to ApoE epsilon4 non-carriers (B-coefficient 0.02, 95 % CI: -0.01,0.05, p = 0.18) in age and sex stratified analysis. CONCLUSION: Future research in the form of large longitudinal observational study is needed to validate our findings, particularly regarding the potential association of stearic acid with cortical Abeta.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, affecting one in eight adults over 65 years of age. The majority of AD cases are sporadic, with unknown etiology, and only 5% of all patients with AD present the familial monogenic form of the disease. In the present study, our aim was to establish an in vitro cell model based on patient-specific human neurons to study the pathomechanism of sporadic AD. METHODS: We compared neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines of patients with early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (fAD), all caused by mutations in the PSEN1 gene; patients with late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD); and three control individuals without dementia. The iPSC lines were differentiated toward mature cortical neurons, and AD pathological hallmarks were analyzed by RT-qPCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blotting methods. RESULTS: Neurons from patients with fAD and patients with sAD showed increased phosphorylation of TAU protein at all investigated phosphorylation sites. Relative to the control neurons, neurons derived from patients with fAD and patients with sAD exhibited higher levels of extracellular amyloid-beta 1-40 (Abeta1-40) and amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42). However, significantly increased Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratios, which is one of the pathological markers of fAD, were observed only in samples of patients with fAD. Additionally, we detected increased levels of active glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, a physiological kinase of TAU, in neurons derived from AD iPSCs, as well as significant upregulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) synthesis and APP carboxy-terminal fragment cleavage. Moreover, elevated sensitivity to oxidative stress, as induced by amyloid oligomers or peroxide, was detected in both fAD- and sAD-derived neurons. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the experiments we performed, we can conclude there is no evident difference except secreted Abeta1-40 levels in phenotype between fAD and sAD samples. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which the hyperphosphorylation of TAU protein has been compared in fAD and sAD iPSC-derived neurons. Our findings demonstrate that iPSC technology is suitable to model both fAD and sAD and may provide a platform for developing new treatment strategies for these conditions.",

    "abstract": "The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is an early site of tau accumulation and MTL dysfunction may underlie episodic-memory decline in aging and dementia. Postmortem data indicate that tau pathology in the transentorhinal cortex is common by age 60, whereas spread to neocortical regions and worsening of cognition is associated with beta-amyloid (Abeta). We used [18F]AV-1451 and [11C]PiB positron emission tomography, structural MRI, and neuropsychological assessment to investigate how in vivo tau accumulation in temporal lobe regions, Abeta, and MTL atrophy contribute to episodic memory in cognitively normal older adults (n = 83; age, 77 +- 6 years; 58% female). Stepwise regressions identified tau in MTL regions known to be affected in old age as the best predictor of episodic-memory performance independent of Abeta status. There was no interactive effect of MTL tau with Abeta on memory. Higher MTL tau was related to higher age in the subjects without evidence of Abeta. Among temporal lobe subregions, episodic memory was most strongly related to tau-tracer uptake in the parahippocampal gyrus, particularly the posterior entorhinal cortex, which in our parcellation includes the transentorhinal cortex. In subjects with longitudinal MRI and cognitive data (n = 57), entorhinal atrophy mirrored patterns of tau pathology and their relationship with memory decline. Our data are consistent with neuropathological studies and further suggest that entorhinal tau pathology underlies memory decline in old age even without Abeta.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Tau tangles and beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques are key lesions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but both pathologies also occur in cognitively normal older people. Neuropathological data indicate that tau tangles in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) underlie episodic-memory impairments in AD dementia. However, it remains unclear whether MTL tau pathology also accounts for memory impairments often seen in elderly people and how Abeta affects this relationship. Using tau-specific and Abeta-specific positron emission tomography tracers, we show that in vivo MTL tau pathology is associated with episodic-memory performance and MTL atrophy in cognitively normal adults, independent of Abeta. Our data point to MTL tau pathology, particularly in the entorhinal cortex, as a substrate of age-related episodic-memory loss.",

    "title": "Combined determination of copper ions and beta-amyloid peptide by a single ratiometric electrochemical biosensor.",
    "abstract": "Copper ions (Cu2+) play a critical role in biological processes and are directly involved in beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) aggregation, which is responsible for the occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, combined determination of Cu2+ and Abeta in one analytical system is of great significance to understand the exact nature of the AD event. This work presents a novel ratiometric electrochemical biosensor for the dual determination of Cu2+ and Abeta1-42. This unique sensor is based on a 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA)-bi functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (ABTS-PDDA/CNTs) composite. The inclusion of ABTS not only enhanced the sensitivity, but it also acted as an inner reference molecule to improve detection accuracy. The specific recognition of Cu2+ was realized by neurokinin B (NKB) coatings on the ABTS-PDDA/CNTs surface to form a [CuII(NKB)2] complex with Cu2+. The ABTS-PDDA/CNTs-NKB modified electrode also displayed an excellent electrochemical response toward the Abeta1-42 monomer, when a certain amount of the Abeta1-42 monomer was added to Cu2+-contained PBS buffer, which was due to the release of Cu2+ from the [CuII(NKB)2] complex through Abeta binding to Cu2+. Meanwhile, our work showed that Cu2+ bound Abeta1-42 was concentration-dependent. Consequently, the presented electrochemical approach was capable of quantifying two important biological species associated with AD by one single biosensor, with the detection limits of 0.04 muM for Cu2+ and 0.5 ng mL-1 for Abeta1-42, respectively. Finally, the ratiometric electrode was successfully applied for monitoring Cu2+ and Abeta1-42 variations in plasma and hippocampus of normal and AD rats.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of midlife lipid levels on Alzheimer brain pathology 20 years later in cognitively normal elderly individuals. METHODS: This is a longitudinal cohort study of 318 cognitively normal individuals with data on fasting lipid levels at midlife (mean age 54 years). Presence of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau pathologies 20 years later (mean age 73 years) were detected by quantifying Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers in CSF. In a subset (n = 134), Abeta (18F-flutemetamol) PET was also performed. RESULTS: CSF Abeta42 and Abeta PET revealed Abeta pathology in approximately 20% of the cognitively healthy population and CSF Abeta42/phosphorylated tau (p-tau) ratio indicated both Abeta and tau pathology in 16%. Higher levels of triglycerides in midlife were independently associated with abnormal CSF Abeta42 (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.75, p = 0.029) and abnormal Abeta42/p-tau ratio (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.10-1.93; p = 0.009) adjusting for age, sex, APOE epsilon4, education, and multiple vascular risk factors. Triglycerides were also associated with abnormal Abeta PET in multivariable regression models, but the association was attenuated in the fully adjusted model. Increased levels of medium and large low-density lipoprotein subfractions were significantly associated with abnormal Abeta PET and large high-density lipoprotein particles were associated with decreased risk of abnormal Abeta PET. CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of triglycerides at midlife predict brain Abeta and tau pathology 20 years later in cognitively healthy individuals. Certain lipoprotein subfractions may also be risk factors for Abeta pathology. These findings further support an involvement of lipids in the very early stages of AD development.",

However, the exact mechanistic link between these two AD lesions remains enigmatic. Through injection of human AD-brain-derived pathological tau (AD-tau) into Abeta plaque-bearing mouse models that do not overexpress tau, we recapitulated the formation of three major types of AD-relevant tau pathologies: tau aggregates in dystrophic neurites surrounding Abeta plaques (NP tau), AD-like neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuropil threads (NTs). These distinct tau pathologies have different temporal onsets and functional consequences on neural activity and behavior. Notably, we found that Abeta plaques created a unique environment that facilitated the rapid amplification of proteopathic AD-tau seeds into large tau aggregates, initially appearing as NP tau, which was followed by the formation and spread of NFTs and NTs, likely through secondary seeding events. Our study provides insights into a new multistep mechanism underlying Abeta plaque-associated tau pathogenesis.",

    "title": "A randomized, exploratory molecular imaging study targeting amyloid beta with a novel 8-OH quinoline in Alzheimer's disease: The PBT2-204 IMAGINE study.",
    "abstract": "Introduction: We are developing a second generation 8-OH quinoline (2-(dimethylamino) methyl-5, 7-dichloro-8-hydroxyquinoline [PBT2, Prana Biotechnology]) for targeting amyloid beta (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In an earlier phase IIa, 3 month trial, PBT2 lowered cerebrospinal fluid Abeta by 13% and improved cognition (executive function) in a dose-related fashion in early AD. We, therefore, sought to learn whether PBT2 could alter the Abeta-PET signal in subjects with prodromal or mild AD, in an exploratory randomized study over a 12-month phase in a double-blind and a 12-month open label extension phase trial design. Methods: For inclusion, the usual clinical criteria for prodromal or probable AD, Mini-Mental State Examination >=20, and global Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET standardized uptake volume ratio (SUVR) >1.7 were used. As this was an exploratory study, we included contemporaneous matched control data from the Australian Imaging Biomarker and Lifestyle Study (AIBL). Other measures included fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging volumetrics, blood Abeta biomarkers, and cognition and function. Results: Forty subjects completed the first 12-month double-blind phase (placebo = 15, PBT2 = 25), and 27 subjects completed the 12-month open label extension phase (placebo = 11, PBT2 = 16). Overall, PTB2 250 mg/day was safe and well tolerated. The mean PiB-PET SUVR at baseline was 2.51 +- 0.59. After adjusting for baseline SUVR, in the double-blind phase, the placebo group showed a nonsignificant decline in PiB-PET SUVR, whereas the PBT2 group declined significantly (P = .048). Subjects who did not enter or complete the extension study had a significantly higher 12-month Abeta-PET SUVR (2.68 +- 0.55) compared with those who completed (2.29 +- 0.48). Both groups differed significantly from the rate of change over 12 months in the AIBL control group. In the open label 12-month extension study, the PiB-SUVR stabilized. There were no significant differences between PBT2 and controls in fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging volumetrics, blood Abeta biomarkers, or cognition/function over the course of the double-blind phase. Discussion: There was no significant difference between PBT2 and controls at 12 months, likely due to the large individual variances over a relatively small number of subjects. PBT2 was associated with a significant 3% PiB-PET SUVR decline in the double-blind phase and a stabilization of SUVR in the open-label phase. From this exploratory study, we have learned that the entry criterion of SUVR should have been set at >= 1.5 and <2.0, where we know from the AIBL study that subjects in this band are accumulating Abeta in a linear fashion and that subjects who withdrew from this type of study have much higher SUVRs, which if not taken into account, could distort the final results. Because of large individual variations in SUVR, future studies of PBT2 will require larger numbers of subjects (n > 90 per arm) over a longer period (18 months or more). Further evaluation of higher doses of PBT2 in earlier stages of AD is warranted. Trial Registration: ACTRN 12611001008910 and ACTRN 12613000777796.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition and neurodegeneration. To seek for signs of such pathologies, we compared regional biomarker degrees and patterns of Abeta deposition, glucose hypometabolism, and gray matter volume (GMV) reduction in 3 groups at risk of AD. In elderly carriers of the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE4, n = 17), patients with subjective cognitive decline (n = 16), and patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 30), head-to-head intermodality comparisons were performed on cross-sectional structural magnetic resonance images as well as 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography scans. In mild cognitive impairment patients, 3 distinct biomarker patterns were recovered, similarly seen in AD patients: (1) in medial temporal regions, local GMV reduction exceeded hypometabolism, (2) in temporoparietal regions, hypometabolism predominated over GMV reduction, and (3) in frontal regions, Abeta deposition exceeded GMV reduction and hypometabolism. In subjective cognitive decline patients, only pattern 1 was detected, while APOE4 carriers demonstrated only pattern 3. Our findings highlight that regional AD-like biomarker patterns may vary across different at-risk populations, potentially reflecting differential mediators of these risks.",

    "abstract": "Among neuropsychiatric diseases, depression is one of the most prevalent. Many pathologies have been indicated as comorbid with depression and in particular, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's diseases (AD). In this regard, several evidences endorse a strong relationship between depression and AD, so much that this mental illness has been proposed either as a risk factor for AD or as a prodromic AD phase. Furthermore, amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, the main constituent of amyloid plaques commonly considered the principal hallmark of AD brains, has been shown to be increased, in its soluble form, in depressed patients. Accordingly, we have previously found that Abeta, intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) injected, is able to evoke a depressive-like profile in rats accompanied by low cortical serotonin and reduced neurotrophin content. Taking into account the great increase in AD and depression prevalence, many environmental factors have been under study, particularly dietary factors, and the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is becoming central in this field of research. Thus, aim of the present study was to evaluate the neurobehavioral effects of lifelong exposure to either n-3 PUFA rich or n-3 PUFA poor diet after Abeta central administration. Results showed that n-3 PUFA enriched diet prevented the Abeta- induced depressive-like behaviors, as reveled by the reduction in the immobility time in the FST test. Furthermore, n-3 PUFA rich diet exposure reverted also serotonin and neurotrophin level reduction in prefrontal cortex of Abeta treated rats. Taken together, our data support the concept that supplementation of diet with n-3 PUFA represents a valid approach to reduce the risk of developing depressive symptoms, as well as reducing the risk of Abeta-related pathologies, such as AD.",

It also remains to be determined which distinct forms of Abeta peptides exert differential effects on platelets. In AD, oligomeric Abeta42 species is widely thought to be a major contributor to the disease pathogenesis. We, therefore, examine the ability of oligomeric and fibrillary Abeta42 to affect platelet aggregation. We show that both forms of Abeta42 induced significant platelet aggregation and that it is a novel ligand for the platelet receptor GPVI. Furthermore, a novel binding peptide that reduces the formation of soluble Abeta42 oligomers was effective at preventing Abeta42-dependent platelet aggregation. These results support a role for Abeta42 oligomers in platelet hyperactivity.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta 1-42) concentrations indicate amyloid plaque accumulation in the brain, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). Innotest assay values of Abeta 1-42 have gradually increased over the past 2 decades, which might lead to misclassification of AD when a single cutpoint for abnormality is used. We propose an unbiased approach to statistically correct for drift. METHODS: We determined year-specific cutpoints with Gaussian mixture modeling, based on the cross-section of bimodal distributions of Abeta 1-42 concentrations in 4397 memory clinic patients. This allowed us to realign year-specific cutpoints as an unbiased method to remove drift from the data. Sensitivity and specificity to detect AD dementia were compared between corrected and uncorrected values. RESULTS: Abeta 1-42 values increased 22 pg/mL annually, and this could not be explained by changes in cohort composition. Our approach removed time dependencies [beta (SE) = 0.07 (0.59); P = 0.91]. Statistically correcting for drift improved the sensitivity to detect AD dementia to 0.90 (95% CI, 0.89-0.92) from at least 0.66 (95% CI, 0.64-0.69) based on uncorrected data. Specificity became lower (0.69; 95% CI, 0.67-0.70) vs at most 0.80 (95% CI, 0.79-0.82) for uncorrected data. CONCLUSIONS: This approach may also be useful to standardize Abeta 1-42 CSF concentrations across different centers and/or platforms, and to optimize use of CSF biomarker data collected over a long period.",

Previous studies suggest that reduction of apoE levels through genetic manipulation can reduce Abeta pathology. However, it is not clear how reduction of apoE levels after birth would affect amyloid deposition. We utilize an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to reduce apoE expression in the brains of APP/PS1-21 mice homozygous for the APOE-epsilon4 or APOE-epsilon3 allele. ASO treatment starting after birth led to a significant decrease in Abeta pathology when assessed at 4 months. Interestingly, ASO treatment starting at the onset of amyloid deposition led to an increase in Abeta plaque size and a reduction in plaque-associated neuritic dystrophy with no change in overall plaque load. These results suggest that lowering apoE levels prior to plaque deposition can strongly affect the initiation of Abeta pathology while lowering apoE after Abeta seeding modulates plaque size and toxicity.",

Using apoE inducible mouse models, we show that increased expression of astrocytic apoE4, but not apoE3, during the seeding stage of amyloid development enhanced amyloid deposition and neuritic dystrophy in amyloid model mice. ApoE4, but not apoE3, significantly increased brain Abeta half-life measured by in vivo microdialysis.

    "abstract": "We use two-dimensional IR (2D IR) spectroscopy to explore fibril formation for the two predominant isoforms of the beta-amyloid (Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42) protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. Two-dimensional IR spectra resolve a transition at 1610 cm-1 in Abeta fibrils that does not appear in other Abeta aggregates, even those with predominantly beta-sheet-structure-like oligomers. This transition is not resolved in linear IR spectroscopy because it lies under the broad band centered at 1625 cm-1, which is the traditional infrared signature for amyloid fibrils. The feature is prominent in 2D IR spectra because 2D lineshapes are narrower and scale nonlinearly with transition dipole strengths. Transmission electron microscopy measurements demonstrate that the 1610 cm-1 band is a positive identification of amyloid fibrils. Sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles that solubilize and disaggregate preaggregated Abeta samples deplete the 1625 cm-1 band but do not affect the 1610 cm-1 band, demonstrating that the 1610 cm-1 band is due to very stable fibrils. We demonstrate that the 1610 cm-1 transition arises from amide I modes by mutating out the only side-chain residue that could give rise to this transition, and we explore the potential structural origins of the transition by simulating 2D IR spectra based on Abeta crystal structures. It was not previously possible to distinguish stable Abeta fibrils from the less stable beta-sheet-rich oligomers with infrared light. This 2D IR signature will be useful for Alzheimer's research on Abeta aggregation, fibril formation, and toxicity.",

However, due to their high affinity and specificity, mAbs may be an attractive option for brain PET if their brain distribution can be facilitated. In the present study, a F(ab')2 fragment of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) protofibril selective mAb158 was chemically conjugated to the transferrin receptor (TfR) antibody 8D3 to enable TfR mediated transcytosis across the BBB. The generated bispecific protein, 8D3-F(ab')2-h158, was subsequently radiolabeled and used for microPET imaging of Abeta pathology in two mouse models of AD. [124I]8D3-F(ab')2-h158 was distributed across the BBB several fold more than unmodified mAbs in general and its accumulation in the brain reflected disease progression, while its concentration in blood and other organs remained stable across all age groups studied. Cerebellum was largely devoid of 8D3-F(ab')2-h158 in young and middle aged mice, while mice older than 18 months also showed some accumulation in cerebellum. In a longer perspective, the use of bispecific antibodies as PET ligands may enable in vivo 'immunohistochemistry' also of other proteins in the brain for which PET radioligands are lacking.",

The N-terminal truncation of Abeta(1-40/42) and their modification, e.g. by glutaminyl cyclase (QC), is expected to enhance the amyloid toxicity. In this work, the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry application proved N-terminal cleavage of Abeta(1-40/42) by purified dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) in vitro observed earlier. The subsequent transformation of resulted Abeta(3-40/42) to pE-Abeta(3-40/42) in QC catalyzed glutamate cyclization was manifested. Hence, consecutive conversion of Abeta(1-40/42) by DPPIV and QC can be assumed as a potential mechanism of formation of non-degrading pyroglutamated pE-Abeta(3-40/42), which might accumulate and contribute to AD progression. The in vitro acceleration of Abeta(1-40) aggregation in the simultaneous presence of DPPIV and QC was shown also.",

    "abstract": "Xanthoceraside, a novel triterpenoid saponin extracted from the husks of Xanthoceras sorbifolia Bunge, has neuroprotective effects in vivo and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro. However, the exact mechanism of xanthoceraside on anti-amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced neuroinflammatory responses has not been elucidated. Therefore, we used intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42) to establish a mouse model to test the effects of xanthoceraside on Abeta-induced cognitive impairments and the TLR2/NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways. The mice received xanthoceraside (0.02, 0.08 or 0.32mg/kg) or vehicle from the day of Abeta1-42 injection. The Morris water maze test was performed 4 days after Abeta1-42 injection. The levels of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-4) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b) in the hippocampus were determined with an immunohistochemistry assay. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were analysed by Western blotting; iNOS, COX-2 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) mRNA expression levels were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Here, we observed that xanthoceraside at doses of 0.08 and 0.32mg/kg significantly improved learning and memory impairments and significantly inhibited GFAP and CD11b overexpression induced by Abeta1-42 in mice. ELISA results revealed that xanthoceraside suppressed IL-6 release and increased IL-4 levels. Western blotting results showed that xanthoceraside reduced iNOS and COX-2 protein levels in hippocampus; xanthoceraside also inhibited translocation of NF-kappaB p50 and p65 into the nucleus and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. RT-PCR confirmed that xanthoceraside decreased iNOS, COX-2 and TLR2 mRNA levels. These results suggest that xanthoceraside inhibition of the TLR2 pathway and down-regulation of MAPK and NF-kappaB activities may be related to the improvement in learning and memory impairments.",

RESULTS: Approximately 6.08 million Americans had either clinical AD or mild cognitive impairment due to AD in 2017 and that will grow to 15.0 million by 2060. In 2017, 46.7 million Americans had preclinical AD (amyloidosis, neurodegeneration, or both), although many may not progress to clinical disease during their lifetimes. Primary and secondary preventions have differential impact on future disease burden. DISCUSSION: Because large numbers of persons are living with preclinical AD, our results underscore the need for secondary preventions for persons with existing AD brain pathology who are likely to develop clinical disease during their lifetimes as well as primary preventions for persons without preclinical disease.",

    "abstract": "Although the formation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) fibrils in neuronal tissues is a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD), small-sized Abeta oligomers rather than mature fibrils have been identified as the most neurotoxic species. Therefore, the design of new inhibitors, able to prevent the aggregation of Abeta, is believed to be a promising therapeutic approach to AD. Unfortunately, the short-lived intermediate structures that occur in a solution along the Abeta aggregation pathway escape conventional experimental investigations and there is urgent need of new tools aimed at the discovery of agents targeting monomeric Abeta and blocking the early steps of amyloid aggregation. Here, we show the combination of high-efficiency slides (HESs) with peptide microarrays as a promising tool for identifying small peptides that bind Abeta monomers. To this aim, HESs with two immobilized reference peptides, (i.e., KLVFF and Semax) with opposite behavior, were investigated for binding to fluorescently labeled Abeta peptide. Transmission electron microscopy was used to demonstrate Abeta fibrillar aggregates missing. The use of HESs was critical to ensure convenient output of the fluorescent microarrays. The resulting sensitivity, as well as the low sample consumption and the high potential for miniaturization, suggests that the proposed combination of peptide microarrays and highly efficient slides would be a very effective technology for molecule profiling in AD drug discovery.",

Optimum force field selection for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the biophysical relevance of results are still unknown. We compared the conformational space of the Abeta(1-40) dimers by 300 ns replica exchange MD simulations at physiological temperature (310 K) using: the AMBER-ff99sb-ILDN, AMBER-ff99sb*-ILDN, AMBER-ff99sb-NMR, and CHARMM22* force fields. Statistical comparisons of simulation results to experimental data and previously published simulations utilizing the CHARMM22* and CHARMM36 force fields were performed. All force fields yield sampled ensembles of conformations with collision cross sectional areas for the dimer that are statistically significantly larger than experimental results. All force fields, with the exception of AMBER-ff99sb-ILDN (8.8 +- 6.4%) and CHARMM36 (2.7 +- 4.2%), tend to overestimate the alpha-helical content compared to experimental CD (5.3 +- 5.2%). Using the AMBER-ff99sb-NMR force field resulted in the greatest degree of variance (41.3 +- 12.9%). Except for the AMBER-ff99sb-NMR force field, the others tended to under estimate the expected amount of beta-sheet and over estimate the amount of turn/bend/random coil conformations. All force fields, with the exception AMBER-ff99sb-NMR, reproduce a theoretically expected beta-sheet-turn-beta-sheet conformational motif, however, only the CHARMM22* and CHARMM36 force fields yield results compatible with collapse of the central and C-terminal hydrophobic cores from residues 17-21 and 30-36. Although analyses of essential subspace sampling showed only minor variations between force fields, secondary structures of lowest energy conformers are different.",

    "abstract": "One of the main research topics related to Alzheimer's disease is the aggregation of the amyloid-beta peptide, which was shown to follow different pathways for the two major alloforms of the peptide, Abeta40 and the more toxic Abeta42. Experimental studies emphasized that oligomers of specific sizes appear in the early aggregation process in different quantities and might be the key toxic agents for each of the two alloforms. We use transition networks derived from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to show that the oligomers leading to the type of oligomer distributions observed in experiments originate from compact conformations. Extended oligomers, on the other hand, contribute more to the production of larger aggregates thus driving the aggregation process. We further demonstrate that differences in the aggregation pathways of the two Abeta alloforms occur as early as during the dimer stage. The higher solvent-exposure of hydrophobic residues in Abeta42 oligomers contributes to the different aggregation pathways of both alloforms and also to the increased cytotoxicity of Abeta42.",

    "abstract": "We studied the interactions of a tau derived hexapeptide AcPHF6 with beta-amyloid peptides Abeta40 and Abeta42 which reveals its unusual ability to promote Abeta fibrillogenesis. The results demonstrate that the N-acetylated and C-amidated AcPHF6 hexapeptide can cause significant acceleration in Abeta40 and Abeta42 fibril growth. Aggregation kinetic studies at pH 7.4 show that at 25 muM, AcPHF6 hexapeptide was able to cause ~2.3-fold increase in Abeta40 fibrillogenesis dramatically changing the aggregation kinetics. In addition, AcPHF6 peptide was able to reduce cellular toxicity mediated by Abeta40 and Abeta42 in hippocampal neuronal cell line (HT22). Computational studies suggest that the AcPHF6 peptide can act as an anchor and provides a hydrophobic surface for Abeta monomer to bind and undergo rapid fibrillogenesis to form less toxic fibrils and alter the aggregation kinetics. At the molecular level we propose a \"dock-and-pack\" mechanism where the AcPHF6 hexapeptide aggregates can stabilize the beta-hairpin and promote rapid Abeta self-assembly and growth to form less toxic oligomers or fibrils. Our results have direct implications in designing novel peptide/peptidomimetics as novel pharmacological tools to study protein aggregation and potentially prevent Abeta-mediated toxicity in Alzheimer's disease.",

Membrane bilayers have been implicated as primary initiators and modulators of amyloid fibrillation and the reasons for this effect are yet to be elucidated. Here, we employed a set of three charged peptides having the tendency to form beta-sheet fibrils, to investigate the effect of zwitterionic and negatively charged bilayer vesicles on their assembly structures. Microscopic and spectroscopic experiments revealed intimate relationship between peptide/membrane charges and fibrillation properties. Electrostatic attraction was apparent between oppositely charged peptides and vesicles; however, such interactions did not appear to significantly modulate fibril morphologies of either the net anionic peptide or the cationic one. Yet, a dramatic structural effect was observed when the nominal zwitterionic peptide underwent fibrillation in the presence of negatively charged vesicles. Assemblies of this peptide display a net positive charge, which facilitated the counterionic interactions with the vesicles. Furthermore, these interactions templated a unique twisted fiber morphology demonstrating the dramatic effect membrane-mediated interactions exert on fibril morphologies.",

Here, we show that complex behavioral deficits in 7-month-old APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice include impairments in object recognition, deficient social interaction, increased depression and buried marbles. Citalopram, one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), ameliorated the amyloid deposition in AD patients and transgenic animal models. After treatment for 4 weeks, citalopram rescued the deficits in short-term memory, sociability and depression in these mice. Further immunohistochemical analysis showed chronic citalopram treatment significantly attenuated beta-amyloid deposition and microglial activation in the brains of APP/PS1 mice as demonstrated previously. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, which are the primary cellular subtype of GABAergic neurons and considered indispensable for short-term memory and social interaction, also contributed to the progress of depression. Additionally, we found the citalopram could significantly increase the PV-positive neurons in the cortex of APP/PS1 mice without alteration in the hippocampus, which might contribute to the improvement of behavioral performance. Our findings suggest that citalopram might be a potential candidate for the early treatment of AD.",

RESULTS: Aging macaques exhibited the same qualitative pattern and sequence of tau and amyloid cortical pathology as humans, reaching Braak stage III/IV. Pathology began in the young-adult entorhinal cortex with protein kinase A-phosphorylation of tau, progressing to fibrillation with paired helical filaments and mature tangles in oldest animals. Tau pathology in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex paralleled but lagged behind the entorhinal cortex, not afflicting the primary visual cortex.

Although many proteins have an intrinsic propensity to aggregate, particularly when cellular clearance systems start to fail in the context of ageing, only a few form fibrillar aggregates. In Alzheimer disease, the peptide amyloid-beta (Abeta) and the protein tau aggregate to form plaques and tangles, respectively, which comprise the histopathological hallmarks of this disease. This Review discusses the complexity of Abeta biogenesis, trafficking, post-translational modifications and aggregation states. Tau and its various isoforms, which are subject to a vast array of post-translational modifications, are also explored. The methodological advances that revealed this complexity are described. Finally, the toxic effects of distinct species of tau and Abeta are discussed, as well as the concept of protein 'strains', and how this knowledge can facilitate the development of early disease biomarkers for stratifying patients and validating new therapies. By targeting distinct species of Abeta and tau for therapeutic intervention, the way might be paved for personalized medicine and more-targeted treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers are the major toxic substances associated with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The ability to measure Abeta oligomer levels in the blood would provide simple and minimally invasive tools for AD diagnostics. In the present study, the recently developed Multimer Detection System (MDS) for AD, a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for measuring Abeta oligomers selectively, was used to detect Abeta oligomers in the plasma of patients with AD and healthy control individuals. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with AD and 37 cognitively normal control individuals underwent extensive clinical evaluations as follows: blood sampling; detailed neuropsychological tests; brain magnetic resonance imaging; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurement of Abeta42, phosphorylated tau protein (pTau), and total tau protein (tTau); and 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) positron emission tomography. Pearson's correlation analyses between the estimations of Abeta oligomer levels by MDS and other conventional AD biomarkers (CSF Abeta42, pTau, and tTau, as well as PIB standardized uptake value ratio [PIB SUVR]) were conducted. ROC analyses were used to compare the diagnostic performance of each biomarker. RESULTS: The plasma levels of Abeta oligomers by MDS were higher in patients with AD than in normal control individuals, and they correlated well with conventional AD biomarkers (levels of Abeta oligomers by MDS vs. CSF Abeta42, r = -0.443; PIB SUVR, r = 0.430; CSF pTau, r = 0.530; CSF tTau, r = 0.604). The sensitivity and specificity of detecting plasma Abeta oligomers by MDS for differentiating AD from the normal controls were 78.3% and 86.5%, respectively. The AUC for plasma Abeta oligomers by MDS was 0.844, which was not significantly different from the AUC of other biomarkers (p = 0.250). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma levels of Abeta oligomers could be assessed using MDS, which might be a simple, noninvasive, and accessible assay for evaluating brain amyloid deposition related to AD pathology.",

In this study, amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates in platelet membranes from 65 patients with CAA and 66 healthy volunteers (controls) were confirmed through thioflavin T (ThT) assay and Western blot analysis. Further, post-translational modifications (PTMs) of Abeta in platelet membranes were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization quadruple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-Q-TOF/MS). ThT assay results indicated that there were amyloid components in platelets from both patients with CAA and controls. Western blot analysis showed that different molecular weight (MW) Abeta aggregates were found in platelet membranes. LC-MS analysis showed that PTMs including methylation, phosphopantetheine, phosphorylation, deamidation, and acetylation, occurred in Abeta peptide in platelet membranes from both patients with CAA and controls, while Met35 oxidation (MetOX) and Gln15 deamidation were identified only from patients with CAA. Thus, this study identified potential biomarkers of CAA and characterized the mechanism underlying amyloidogenesis in CAA.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Because curcumin's anti-inflammatory properties may protect the brain from neurodegeneration, we studied its effect on memory in non-demented adults and explored its impact on brain amyloid and tau accumulation using 2-(1-{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile positron emission tomography (FDDNP-PET). METHODS: Forty subjects (age 51-84 years) were randomized to a bioavailable form of curcumin (Theracurmin  containing 90 mg of curcumin twice daily [N = 21]) or placebo (N = 19) for 18 months. Primary outcomes were verbal (Buschke Selective Reminding Test [SRT]) and visual (Brief Visual Memory Test-Revised [BVMT-R]) memory, and attention (Trail Making A) was a secondary outcome. FDDNP-PET signals (15 curcumin, 15 placebo) were determined in amygdala, hypothalamus, medial and lateral temporal, posterior cingulate, parietal, frontal, and motor (reference) regions. Mixed effects general linear models controlling for age and education, and effect sizes (ES; Cohen's d) were estimated. RESULTS: SRT Consistent Long-Term Retrieval improved with curcumin (ES = 0.63, p = 0.002) but not with placebo (ES = 0.06, p = 0.8; between-group: ES = 0.68, p = 0.05). Curcumin also improved SRT Total (ES = 0.53, p = 0.002), visual memory (BVMT-R Recall: ES = 0.50, p = 0.01; BVMT-R Delay: ES = 0.51, p = 0.006), and attention (ES = 0.96, p < 0.0001) compared with placebo (ES = 0.28, p = 0.1; between-group: ES = 0.67, p = 0.04). FDDNP binding decreased significantly in the amygdala with curcumin (ES = -0.41, p = 0.04) compared with placebo (ES = 0.08, p = 0.6; between-group: ES = 0.48, p = 0.07). In the hypothalamus, FDDNP binding did not change with curcumin (ES = -0.30, p = 0.2), but increased with placebo (ES = 0.26, p = 0.05; between-group: ES = 0.55, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Daily oral Theracurmin may lead to improved memory and attention in non-demented adults. The FDDNP-PET findings suggest that symptom benefits are associated with decreases in amyloid and tau accumulation in brain regions modulating mood and memory.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating disease characterized with progressive neurodegenerative disorders in the elderly. Epidemiological and clinical studies reported that lifestyle factors could halt the progression of AD, especially physical exercise. In the present work, we investigated the effects of long-term treadmill exercise on the pathological cascades of AD in APP/PS1 mice. After exercise for 5 months, Abeta deposition was significantly ameliorated in terms of Abeta area fraction, plaque number and size. We also found that long-term treadmill exercise increased neuronal density and attenuated activation of astrocytes. However, the activation of microglia was not affected in APP/PS1 mice treated with exercise intervention. In addition, the amyloidogenic pathway of amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism was inhibited, with the decrease of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and presenilin 1 (PS1). Nevertheless, the nonamyloidogenic pathway of APP metabolism was increased after exercise intervention. The expression levels of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) also declined significantly. In conclusion, long-term treadmill exercise is neuroprotective against Abeta burdens and astrocyte activation, which contributes to the therapy for AD.",

    "title": "Abeta mediates F-actin disassembly in dendritic spines leading to cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Dendritic spine loss is recognized as an early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Dendritic spine structure is defined by filamentous actin (F-actin) and we observed depolymerization of synaptosomal F-actin accompanied by increased globular-actin (G-actin) at as early as 1 month of age in a mouse model of AD (APPswe/PS1DeltaE9, male mice). This led to recall deficit after contextual fear conditioning (cFC) at 2 months of age in APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 male mice, which could be reversed by the actin-polymerizing agent jasplakinolide. Further, the F-actin-depolymerizing agent latrunculin induced recall deficit after cFC in WT mice, indicating the importance of maintaining F-/G-actin equilibrium for optimal behavioral response. Using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), we show that F-actin depolymerization in spines leads to a breakdown of the nano-organization of outwardly radiating F-actin rods in cortical neurons from APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice. Our results demonstrate that synaptic dysfunction seen as F-actin disassembly occurs very early, before onset of pathological hallmarks in AD mice, and contributes to behavioral dysfunction, indicating that depolymerization of F-actin is causal and not consequent to decreased spine density. Further, we observed decreased synaptosomal F-actin levels in postmortem brain from mild cognitive impairment and AD patients compared with subjects with normal cognition. F-actin decrease correlated inversely with increasing AD pathology (Braak score, Abeta load, and tangle density) and directly with performance in episodic and working memory tasks, suggesting its role in human disease pathogenesis and progression.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Synaptic dysfunction underlies cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cytoskeletal protein actin plays a critical role in maintaining structure and function of synapses. Using cultured neurons and an AD mouse model, we show for the first time that filamentous actin (F-actin) is lost selectively from synapses early in the disease process, long before the onset of classical AD pathology. We also demonstrate that loss of synaptic F-actin contributes directly to memory deficits. Loss of synaptosomal F-actin in human postmortem tissue correlates directly with decreased performance in memory test and inversely with AD pathology. Our data highlight that synaptic cytoarchitectural changes occur early in AD and they may be targeted for the development of therapeutics.",

Increasing concentrations of Abeta within the brain cause synapse degeneration and the dementia that is characteristic of AD. Here the factors that affect the release of disease-relevant forms Abeta were studied in a cell model. 7PA2 cells expressing the human amyloid precursor protein released soluble Abeta oligomers that caused synapse damage in cultured neurons. Supernatants from 7PA2 cells treated with the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor squalestatin contained similar concentrations of Abeta42 to control cells but did not cause synapse damage in neuronal cultures. These supernatants contained reduced concentrations of Abeta42 oligomers and increased concentrations of Abeta42 monomers. Treatment of 7PA2 cells with platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonists had similar effects; it reduced concentrations of Abeta42 oligomers and increased concentrations of Abeta42 monomers in cell supernatants. PAF activated cholesterol ester hydrolases (CEH), enzymes that released cholesterol from stores of cholesterol esters. Inhibition of CEH also reduced concentrations of Abeta42 oligomers and increased concentrations of Abeta42 monomers in cell supernatants. The Abeta monomers produced by treated cells protected neurons against Abeta oligomer-induced synapse damage. These studies indicate that pharmacological manipulation of cells can alter the ratio of Abeta monomer:oligomer released and consequently their effects on synapses.",

    "abstract": "Copper(II) complexes with 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-HQ) and two 8-HQ derivatives, namely clioquinol (CQ) and 5,7-dichloro-2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]quinolin-8-ol (PBT2), were investigated in organic and, where feasible, in aqueous solutions. This class of compounds is of particular interest in neurological disorders since they may act as metal-protein attenuating compounds and may help redistributing metal ions and restoring intracellular metal reserves, which are often perturbed in neurological patients. Several techniques, like potentiometry, UV-Vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), cyclic voltammetry and electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), were used to obtain information on both the formation of copper(II) complexes in solution as well as on the structure of their species. Multi-wavelength treatment of UV-Vis data clearly indicated the formation of both [Cu(PBT2)]+ and [Cu(PBT2)2] species; the speciation was also supported by ESI-MS data. The EPR results showed that the mono- and bis-copper(II) complexes with PBT2 have square-based pyramidal structures while the bis-copper (II) complexes with CQ or 8-HQ have square-planar o pseudo-octahedral geometries. The formation of copper(II) ternary complexes with 8-HQ, CQ and PBT2 and some selected neurotransmitters (glycine, glutamate and histidine) is also reported. Except for the copper(II) ternary complex with PBT2 and His, almost all ternary complexes have molecular geometries, which are not different from those of the bis-complexes. Interestingly the ternary copper(II) complexes, containing CQ, 8-HQ and PBT2 and glycine, glutamate or histidine turned out to be more soluble in aqueous solution than their binary complexes with parent 8-HQ derivatives; the copper(II) complexes can also be reduced more easily than their parent bis-complexes.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: To investigate restorative effects of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)-specific inhibitor FPS-ZM1 on abnormal amyloid beta (Abeta) influx across the blood brain-barrier (BBB) and cognitive deficits in db/db mice. METHODS: Abeta influx across the BBB was determined by intra-arterial infusion of 125I-Abeta1-40. Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), Abeta, NF-kappaB p65, caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, PSD-95 and synaptophysin were assayed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry or RT-PCR. Apoptosis was quantified by TUNEL assay. In vivo hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) recording, Golgi Staining, Morris water maze (MWM) task and Y-maze test were performed. RESULTS: FPS-ZM1 (1.0 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited Abeta influx across the BBB and expression of RAGE participating in Abeta influx, consequently decreased hippocampal Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 in db/db mice. After FPS-ZM1 treatment, NF-kappaB signaling was inhibited, and neuronal apoptosis was reduced, which revealed by less TUNEL + cells, reduced caspase-3 activity and higher ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. In addition, FPS-ZM1 improved hippocampal plasticity evidenced by enhanced in vivo LTP and the restoration of spine deficit and increased PSD-95 expression in hippocampal neuron. Further studies found that FPS-ZM1 treatment alleviated cognitive deficits shown by better performance in behavioral tests, without significant metabolic effects on blood glucose, insulin and cerebral AGEs. CONCLUSION: Downregulation of abnormal Abeta influx across the BBB by FPS-ZM1 at higher dosage contributes to reduced neuronal apoptosis, improved hippocampal plasticity and cognitive impairment in db/db mice.",

    "abstract": "During preclinical drug development, a method for quantification of unlabeled compounds in blood plasma samples from treatment or pharmacokinetic studies in mice is required. In the current work, a rapid, specific, sensitive and validated liquid chromatography mass-spectrometric UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS method was developed for the quantification of the therapeutic compound RD2 in mouse plasma. RD2 is an all-D-enantiomeric peptide developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease finally leading to dementia. Due to RD2's highly hydrophilic properties, the sample preparation and the chromatographic separation and quantification were very challenging. The chromatographic separation of RD2 and its internal standard were accomplished on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7 mum particle size) within 6.5 min at 50  C with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Mobile phases consisted of water and acetonitrile with 1% formic acid and 0.025% heptafluorobutyric acid, respectively. Ions were generated by electrospray ionization (ESI) in the positive mode and the peptide was quantified by QTOF-MS. The developed extraction method for RD2 from mouse plasma revealed complete recovery. The linearity of the calibration curve was in the range of 5.3 ng/mL to 265 ng/mL (r2 > 0.999) with a lower limit of detection (LLOD) of 2.65 ng/mL and a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 5.3 ng/mL. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision of RD2 in plasma ranged from -0.54% to 2.21% and from 1.97% to 8.18%, respectively. Moreover, no matrix effects were observed and RD2 remained stable in extracted mouse plasma at different conditions. Using this validated bioanalytical method, plasma samples of unlabeled RD2 or placebo treated mice were analyzed. The herein developed UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS method is a suitable tool for the quantitative analysis of unlabeled RD2 in plasma samples of treated mice.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer'sdisease(AD) is characterized by deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta)plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, andneuronal loss, accompaniedbyneuroinflammation. Neuroinflammatoryprocesses are thought to contribute toAD pathophysiology. Metformin has been reported to have anti-inflammatory efficacy. However, whether metformin is responsible for the anti-neuroinflammationand neuroprotection on APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 (APP/PS1) mice remains unclear. Here we showed that metformin attenuated spatial memory deficit, neuron loss in the hippocampus and enhanced neurogenesis in APP/PS1 mice. In addition, metformin administration decreased amyloid-beta (Abeta)plaque load and chronic inflammation (activated microglia and astrocytes as well as pro-inflammatory mediators) in the hippocampus and cortex. Further study demonstrated that treatment with metformin enhanced cerebral AMPK activation. Meanwhile, metformin notably suppressed the activation of P65 NF-kappaB, mTOR and S6K, reduced Bace1 protein expression. Our data suggest that metformin can exert functional recovery of memory deficits and neuroprotective effect on APP/PS1 mice via triggering neurogenesis and anti-inflammation mediated by regulating AMPK/mTOR/S6K/Bace1 and AMPK/P65 NF-kappaB signaling pathways in the hippocampus, which may contribute to improvement in neurological deficits.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Little is known about Alzheimer's disease molecular proteins, beta-amyloid and paired helical filament (PHF) tau, in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Recent techniques have been developed to allow for investigations of these proteins in PSP. We determined the frequency of beta-amyloid deposition in PSP, and whether beta-amyloid deposition in PSP is associated with PHF-tau deposition pattern, or clinical features. METHODS: Thirty probable PSP participants underwent MRI, [18F]AV-1451 PET and Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET. Apolipoprotein (APOE) genotyping was also performed. A global PiB standard-uptake value ratio (SUVR) was calculated. AV-1451 SUVRs were calculated for a set of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related regions and a set of PSP-related regions. Voxel-level analyses were conducted to assess for differences in AV-1451 uptake patterns and MRI atrophy between PiB(+) and PiB(-) cases compared to 60 normal PiB(-) controls. Statistical testing for correlations and associations between variables of interest were also performed. RESULTS: Twelve subjects (40%) showed beta-amyloid deposition. Higher PiB SUVR correlated with older age but not with AV-1451 SUVR in the AD- or PSP-related regions. Higher AV-1451 SUVR in AD-related regions was associated with higher AV-1451 SUVR in PSP-related regions. We found little evidence for beta-amyloid related differences in clinical metrics, proportion of APOE e4 carriers, pattern of AV-1451 uptake, or pattern of atrophy. CONCLUSION: Beta-amyloid deposition occurs in a relatively high proportion of PSP subjects. Unlike in Alzheimer's disease, however, there is little evidence that beta-amyloid, and PHF-tau, play a significant role in neurodegeneration in PSP.",

    "title": "Amyloid beta-Derived Diffusible Ligands (ADDLs) Induce Abnormal Autophagy Associated with Abeta Aggregation Degree.",
    "abstract": "Autophagy is disturbed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and maintaining normal autophagy homeostasis is a new therapeutic strategy for AD treatment. Amyloid beta-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), the most toxic species of which are oligomeric forms of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) that originate from amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) via autophagy; however, whether ADDLs are involved in autophagy-related AD pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we primarily defined the specific subsets of ADDLs, A-0, A-12, A-24, and A-48, which were generated from ADDL aggregation mixtures at different time courses of assembly. The secondary structures of ADDL subsets were detected by circular dichroism (CD). Neuronal or non-neuronal cells were exposed to the subsets of ADDLs in vitro, and then, autophagic markers were detected. Our results first showed that exogenous or endogenous LC3 puncta (autophagosomes) were induced in the cytoplasm of cells exposed to ADDLs and that the LC3 puncta were the strongest with A-24 exposure. Then, the CD spectroscopy data also indicated that the proportion of alpha-helices decreased, whereas the proportion of beta-strands and beta-turns increased during ADDL assembly from 0 to 24 h. In addition, the quantitative Western blot data demonstrated that the ratio of LC3B-II/I was significantly increased, and SQSTM1/p62 decreased over time. Finally, our results indicated that the level of phosphorylated p70 S6 kinase (p-p70 S6 kinase), which is a substrate protein in the MTOR pathway, and the ratio of p-p70 S6 kinase/p70 S6 kinase significantly decreased following A-24 exposure. Taken together, our data suggest that ADDL-induced abnormal autophagy is correlated with Abeta aggregation degree and the MTOR pathway, which might contribute to ADDL-induced AD pathogenesis.",

    "title": "Investigating the genetic architecture of dementia with Lewy bodies: a two-stage genome-wide association study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dementia with Lewy bodies is the second most common form of dementia in elderly people but has been overshadowed in the research field, partly because of similarities between dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. So far, to our knowledge, no large-scale genetic study of dementia with Lewy bodies has been done. To better understand the genetic basis of dementia with Lewy bodies, we have done a genome-wide association study with the aim of identifying genetic risk factors for this disorder. METHODS: In this two-stage genome-wide association study, we collected samples from white participants of European ancestry who had been diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies according to established clinical or pathological criteria. In the discovery stage (with the case cohort recruited from 22 centres in ten countries and the controls derived from two publicly available database of Genotypes and Phenotypes studies [phs000404.v1.p1 and phs000982.v1.p1] in the USA), we performed genotyping and exploited the recently established Haplotype Reference Consortium panel as the basis for imputation. Pathological samples were ascertained following autopsy in each individual brain bank, whereas clinical samples were collected after participant examination. There was no specific timeframe for collection of samples. We did association analyses in all participants with dementia with Lewy bodies, and also only in participants with pathological diagnosis. In the replication stage, we performed genotyping of significant and suggestive results from the discovery stage. Lastly, we did a meta-analysis of both stages under a fixed-effects model and used logistic regression to test for association in each stage. FINDINGS: This study included 1743 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (1324 with pathological diagnosis) and 4454 controls (1216 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies vs 3791 controls in the discovery stage; 527 vs 663 in the replication stage). Results confirm previously reported associations: APOE (rs429358; odds ratio [OR] 2 40, 95% CI 2 14-2 70; p=1 05 x 10-48), SNCA (rs7681440; OR 0 73, 0 66-0 81; p=6 39 x 10-10), an GBA (rs35749011; OR 2 55, 1 88-3 46; p=1 78 x 10-9). They also provide some evidence for a novel candidate locus, namely CNTN1 (rs7314908; OR 1 51, 1 27-1 79; p=2 32 x 10-6); further replication will be important. Additionally, we estimate the heritable component of dementia with Lewy bodies to be about 36%. INTERPRETATION: Despite the small sample size for a genome-wide association study, and acknowledging the potential biases from ascertaining samples from multiple locations, we present the most comprehensive and well powered genetic study in dementia with Lewy bodies so far. These data show that common genetic variability has a role in the disease. FUNDING: The Alzheimer's Society and the Lewy Body Society.",

    "title": "Brain amyloid load and its associations with cognition and vascular risk factors in FINGER Study.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate brain amyloid pathology in a dementia-risk population defined as cardiovascular risk factors, aging, and dementia risk (CAIDE) score of at least 6 but with normal cognition and to examine associations between brain amyloid load and cognitive performance and vascular risk factors. METHODS: A subgroup of 48 individuals from the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) main study participated in brain 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET imaging, brain MRI, and neuropsychological assessment at the beginning of the study. Lifestyle/vascular risk factors were determined as body mass index, blood pressure, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose homeostasis model assessment. White matter lesions were visually rated from MRIs by a semiquantitative Fazekas score. RESULTS: Twenty participants (42%) had a positive PiB-PET on visual analysis. The PiB-positive group performed worse in executive functioning tests, included more participants with APOE epsilon4 allele (50%), and showed slightly better glucose homeostasis compared to PiB-negative participants. PiB-positive and -negative participants did not differ significantly in other cognitive domain scores or other vascular risk factors. There was no significant difference in Fazekas score between the PiB groups. CONCLUSIONS: The high percentage of PiB-positive participants provides evidence of a successful recruitment process of the at-risk population in the main FINGER intervention trial. The results suggest a possible association between early brain amyloid accumulation and decline in executive functions. APOE epsilon4 was clearly associated with amyloid positivity, but no other risk factor was found to be associated with positive PiB-PET.",

    "title": "A human microglia-like cellular model for assessing the effects of neurodegenerative disease gene variants.",
    "abstract": "Microglia are emerging as a key cell type in neurodegenerative diseases, yet human microglia are challenging to study in vitro. We developed an in vitro cell model system composed of human monocyte-derived microglia-like (MDMi) cells that recapitulated key aspects of microglia phenotype and function. We then used this model system to perform an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) study examining 94 genes from loci associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. We found six loci (CD33, PILRB, NUP160, LRRK2, RGS1, and METTL21B) in which the risk haplotype drives the association with both disease susceptibility and altered expression of a nearby gene (cis-eQTL). In the PILRB and LRRK2 loci, the cis-eQTL was found in the MDMi cells but not in human peripheral blood monocytes, suggesting that differentiation of monocytes into microglia-like cells led to the acquisition of a cellular state that could reveal the functional consequences of certain genetic variants. We further validated the effect of risk haplotypes at the protein level for PILRB and CD33, and we confirmed that the CD33 risk haplotype altered phagocytosis by the MDMi cells. We propose that increased LRRK2 gene expression by MDMi cells could be a functional outcome of rs76904798, a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the LRKK2 locus that is associated with Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system dysfunction is known to contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Besides a variety of reports showing the involvement of norepinephrine and its receptor systems in cognition, amyloid beta (Abeta) metabolism, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis, little is known about the contribution of the specific receptors to these actions. Here, we investigated the neurogenic and neuroprotective properties of a new alpha2 adrenoblocker, mesedin, in astroglial primary cultures (APC) from C57BL/6 and 3xTg-AD mice. Our results demonstrate that mesedin rescues neuronal precursors and young neurons, and reduces the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from astroglia under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Mesedin also increased choline acetyltransferase, postsynaptic density marker 95 (PSD95), and Abeta-degrading enzyme neprilysin in the wild type APC, while in the 3xTg-AD APC exposed to glutamate, it decreased the intracellular content of Abeta and enhanced the survival of synaptophysin-positive astroglia and neurons. These effects in APC can at least partially be attributed to the mesedin's ability of increasing the expression of Interleukine(IL)-10, which is a potent anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective neurogenic, and Abeta metabolism enhancing factor. In summary, our data identify the neurogenic, neuroprotective, and anti-amyloidogenic action of mesedin in APC. Further in vivo studies are needed to estimate the therapeutic value of mesedin for AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain. Abeta oligomers are believed to cause synapse damage resulting in the memory deficits that are characteristic of this disease. Since the loss of synaptic proteins in the brain correlates closely with the degree of dementia in Alzheimer's disease, the process of Abeta-induced synapse damage was investigated in cultured neurons by measuring the loss of synaptic proteins. Soluble Abeta oligomers, derived from Alzheimer's-affected brains, caused the loss of cysteine string protein and synaptophysin from neurons. When applied to synaptosomes Abeta oligomers increased cholesterol concentrations and caused aberrant activation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). In contrast, Abeta monomer preparations did not affect cholesterol concentrations or activate synaptic cPLA2, nor did they damage synapses. The Abeta oligomer-induced aggregation of cellular prion proteins (PrPC) at synapses triggered the activation of cPLA2 that leads to synapse degeneration. Critically, Abeta monomer preparations did not cause the aggregation of PrPC; rather they reduced the Abeta oligomer-induced aggregation of PrPC. The presence of Abeta monomer preparations also inhibited the Abeta oligomer-induced increase in cholesterol concentrations and activation of cPLA2 in synaptosomes and protected neurons against the Abeta oligomer-induced synapse damage. These results support the hypothesis that Abeta monomers are neuroprotective. We hypothesise that synapse damage may result from a pathological Abeta monomer:oligomer ratio rather than the total concentrations of Abeta within the brain.",

METHODS: Eighty-two cognitively normal older adults and 46 healthy young participants underwent fMRI during task switching. All older participants completed 18F-florbetaben-PET and an individual's amyloid positivity status was determined. To assess GM volume, T1-weighted high-resolution structural images were processed using voxel-based morphometry. As lifestyle factors, intellectual activity was estimated by a composite score of vocabulary, reading ability, and years of education. RESULTS: Across all older participants, intellectual activity was associated with lower amyloid deposition in lateral and medial frontoparietal and temporal lobes but higher amyloid deposition in superior frontal and parietal cortices, larger GM volume across widespread brain regions, and reduced brain activation during task switching. These patterns of associations, however, differed by amyloid positivity status. While the patterns of associations remained similar among amyloid-negative older adults, among amyloid-positive older adults, intellectual activity was associated with increased amyloid deposition in frontoparietal cortices and increased activation during task. CONCLUSIONS: Intellectual activity simultaneously exerts both neuroprotective and compensatory effects via multiple neural pathways that promote optimal brain aging and help maintain normal cognition during amyloid accumulation.",

We hypothesized that Intensive Care Unit (ICU) survivors with cognitive impairment would have significant amyloid and designed a pilot study to explore this relationship. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pilot, case series of a convenience sample of 14 adult medical and surgical ICU survivors, in a clinical neuroradiology clinic. Patients underwent cognitive testing at 3months, 1year, 4years, and 6years after hospital discharge with the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. They received a single PET scan using amyloid PET imaging (florbetapir F18) 2 to 4years after their ICU stay. RESULTS: Amyloid (defined as a Standard Uptake Value ratio or SUVr >1.10) was present in 2 of 14 (14%) individuals, both of whom demonstrated significant cognitive impairment yet no consistent decline over time. Of the 6 impaired patients (RBANS<78), 4 (66.7%) were amyloid negative. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to assess ICU survivors with amyloid imaging. In this small sample, most patients with cognitive impairment were negative on amyloid PET imaging, which raises the possibility that ICU survivors may experience a unique form of dementia not driven by an amyloid related mechanism.",

The healthy unaffected neurons suffer the transmission of amyloid protein from pathologically affected neurons, which may play an important role in the anatomical spread of the disease. Exosomes are appropriate candidates for transmission of amyloid species, because of their potential role as \"intercellular transportation\". To address a role of secreted exosomes in neuronal homeostasis in AD, we harvested exosomes from the conditioned medium of HEK293-APP Swe/Ind cells. We have demonstrated that these exosomes contained APP and were capable of efficiently transferring APP to normal primary neurons. Moreover, these exosomes had dose-dependent detrimental effect on cultured neurons. Our results suggest a key mechanism underlying the spread of amyloid protein in the brain and the acceleration of pathology in AD; exosomes secretion serves to amplify and propagate Alzheimer's disease related pathology.",

Emerging biomarker data demonstrate that Abeta plaque deposition begins decades before the onset of clinical symptoms, suggesting that understanding the biological determinants of the earliest steps in the development of AD pathology may provide key opportunities for AD treatment and prevention. Although a clinical association between sleep disruption and AD has long been appreciated, emerging clinical studies and insights from the basic neurosciences have shed important new light on how sleep and Abeta homeostasis may be connected in the setting of AD. Abeta, like many interstitial solutes, is cleared in part through the exchange of brain interstitial fluid and cerebrospinal fluid along a brain-wide network of perivascular pathways recently termed the glymphatic system. Glymphatic function is primarily a feature of the sleeping brain, rather than the waking brain, and is slowed in the aging and posttraumatic brain. These changes may underlie the diurnal fluctuations in interstitial and cerebrospinal fluid Abeta levels observed in both the rodent and the human. These and other emerging studies suggest that age-related sleep disruption may be one key factor that renders the aging brain vulnerable to Abeta deposition and the development of AD. If this is true, sleep may represent a key modifiable risk factor or therapeutic target in the preclinical phases of AD.",

Evidence suggests that this link between AD and T2D might originate from a structural similarity between aggregates of Abeta and hIAPP. Using the cryoEM method microelectron diffraction, we determined the atomic structures of 11-residue segments from both Abeta and hIAPP, termed Abeta(24-34) WT and hIAPP(19-29) S20G, with 64% sequence similarity. We observed a high degree of structural similarity between their backbone atoms (0.96-A root mean square deviation). Moreover, fibrils of these segments induced amyloid formation through self- and cross-seeding. Furthermore, inhibitors designed for one segment showed cross-efficacy for full-length Abeta and hIAPP and reduced cytotoxicity of both proteins, although by apparently blocking different cytotoxic mechanisms. The similarity of the atomic structures of Abeta(24-34) WT and hIAPP(19-29) S20G offers a molecular model for cross-seeding between Abeta and hIAPP.",

METHODS: Fifty-three patients (28 with clinical Alzheimer disease [AD] and 25 with non-AD clinical neurodegenerative diagnoses) underwent beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau ([18F]AV1451) PET and lumbar puncture. CSF biomarkers (Abeta42, total tau [t-tau], and phosphorylated tau [p-tau]) were measured by multianalyte immunoassay (AlzBio3). Receiver operator characteristic analyses were performed to compare discrimination of Abeta-positive AD from non-AD conditions across biomarkers. Correlations between CSF biomarkers and PET standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) were assessed using skipped Pearson correlation coefficients. Voxelwise analyses were run to assess regional CSF-PET associations. RESULTS: [18F]AV1451-PET cortical SUVR and p-tau showed excellent discrimination between Abeta-positive AD and non-AD conditions (area under the curve 0.92-0.94; <=0.83 for other CSF measures), and reached 83% classification agreement. In the full sample, cortical [18F]AV1451 was associated with all CSF biomarkers, most strongly with p-tau (r = 0.75 vs 0.57 for t-tau and -0.49 for Abeta42). When restricted to Abeta-positive patients with AD, [18F]AV1451 SUVR correlated modestly with p-tau and t-tau (both r = 0.46) but not Abeta42 (r = 0.02). On voxelwise analysis, [18F]AV1451 correlated with CSF p-tau in temporoparietal cortices and with t-tau in medial prefrontal regions. Within AD, Mini-Mental State Examination scores were associated with [18F]AV1451-PET, but not CSF biomarkers. CONCLUSION: [18F]AV1451-PET and CSF p-tau had comparable value for differential diagnosis. Correlations were robust in a heterogeneous clinical group but attenuated (although significant) in AD, suggesting that fluid and imaging biomarkers capture different aspects of tau pathology.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) against the deleterious impact of AbetaOs on hippocampal neurons. To this end, we established transwell cocultures of rat hippocampal neurons and MSCs. We show that MSCs and MSC-derived extracellular vesicles protect neurons against AbetaO-induced oxidative stress and synapse damage, revealed by loss of pre- and postsynaptic markers. Protection by MSCs entails three complementary mechanisms: 1) internalization and degradation of AbetaOs; 2) release of extracellular vesicles containing active catalase; and 3) selective secretion of interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and vascular endothelial growth factor to the medium. Results support the notion that MSCs may represent a promising alternative for cell-based therapies in AD.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has still not been fully elucidated, however it is thought that the build up of amyloid plaque at least partially causes the symptoms of AD. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding small RNA molecules that regulate the expression and degradation of proteins. The present study induced symptoms of AD in mice via intraventricular injection of amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42), which decreased levels of miR-107. However, miR-107 levels increased following administration of miR-107 mimic, a double-stranded RNA molecule designed to imitate the native miRNA. Intraventricular injection of Abeta1-42 aggregates led to spatial memory impairments, inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and resulted in the loss of pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The miR-107 mimic reversed the impairments of spatial memory and LTP and the loss of pyramidal neurons caused by Abeta neurotoxicity. Furthermore, the miR-107 mimic reversed the Abeta-induced increase in Abeta1-42 and phosphorylated Tau levels. Critically, Abeta1-42 injection decreased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and reduced the phosphorylation of tyrosine receptor kinase B and protein kinase B; these changes were reversed following treatment with the miR-107 mimic. Collectively, these results demonstrated that miR-107 may be a potential target for the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Safflower yellow (SY), one of traditional Chinese medicine extracted from safflower, has been shown to have neuroprotective effects on animal models of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's diseases (AD), by inhibiting oxidative injury, neuronal apoptosis and tau hyperphosphorylation. In this study, we investigated whether safflower yellow (SY) can improve cognitive function, decrease Amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation and overactivation of astrocytes in AD mouse model. We found that SY treatment significantly ameliorated the learning and memory deficits of APP/PS1 mice. By hematoxylin-eosin staining, we found that the neuronal loss and death in APP/PS1 mice was decreased by SY treatment. Immunohistochemical staining showed that SY treatment dramatically down-regulated Abeta1-42 deposition and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) level in APP/PS1 mice. Biochemical analysis also showed that SY treatment reduced soluble and insoluble Abeta1-42 level in the cortex and soluble Abeta1-42 level in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, we found that SY treatment decreased the expression of proteins related to generation of Abeta, and markedly increased expression of enzymes associated with clearance of Abeta in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. These results indicate that the SY can serve as a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD.",

In patients with Alzheimer's disease, deposition of amyloid-beta is accompanied by activation of the innate immune system and involves inflammasome-dependent formation of ASC specks in microglia. ASC specks released by microglia bind rapidly to amyloid-beta and increase the formation of amyloid-beta oligomers and aggregates, acting as an inflammation-driven cross-seed for amyloid-beta pathology. Here we show that intrahippocampal injection of ASC specks resulted in spreading of amyloid-beta pathology in transgenic double-mutant APPSwePSEN1dE9 mice. By contrast, homogenates from brains of APPSwePSEN1dE9 mice failed to induce seeding and spreading of amyloid-beta pathology in ASC-deficient APPSwePSEN1dE9 mice. Moreover, co-application of an anti-ASC antibody blocked the increase in amyloid-beta pathology in APPSwePSEN1dE9 mice. These findings support the concept that inflammasome activation is connected to seeding and spreading of amyloid-beta pathology in patients with Alzheimer's disease.",

The pathological hallmarks of AD such as beta amyloid (Abeta) aggregation and neurometabolic change, as indicated by altered myo-inositol (mI) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) levels, typically precede the onset of cognitive dysfunction by years. Furthermore, cerebrovascular disease occurs early in AD, but the interplay between vascular and neurometabolic brain change is largely unknown. Thirty cognitively normal older adults (age = 70 +- 5.6 years, Mini-Mental State Examination = 29.2 +- 1) received 11-C-Pittsburgh Compound B positron emission tomography for estimating Abeta-plaque density, 7 Tesla fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging for quantifying white matter hyperintensity volume as a marker of small vessel cerebrovascular disease and high-resolution magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging at 7 Tesla, based on free induction decay acquisition localized by outer volume suppression to investigate tissue-specific neurometabolism in the posterior cingulate and precuneus. Abeta (beta = 0.45, p = 0.018) and white matter hyperintensities (beta = 0.40, p = 0.046) were independently and interactively (beta = -0.49, p = 0.026) associated with a higher ratio of mI over NAA (mI/NAA) in the posterior cingulate and precuneus gray matter but not in the white matter. Our data suggest that cerebrovascular disease and Abeta burden are synergistically associated with AD-related gray matter neurometabolism in older adults.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the changes in beta-amyloid (Abeta) expression in age-related cataract (ARC) lens epithelia and the effect of Abeta on oxidative damage in human lens epithelial cells (HLECs). Methods: Specimens of lens epithelia and aqueous humor were obtained from 255 cataract surgery patients and 48 healthy donor eyes. The ARC samples were divided into four groups according to the Lens Opacities Classification System III, with increasing severity from Group I to Group IV. The HLECs were cultured under healthy or oxidative conditions with or without Abeta pretreatment. Western blot, immunofluorescence, real-time PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed to detect Abeta and beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression. beta-secretase activity was analyzed in lens epithelia and HLECs. The effect of Abeta on the viability of HLECs under oxidative conditions was investigated using a cell viability assay. Results: Compared with the healthy group, the Abeta 1-42 expression levels in lens epithelia and Abeta 1-40 expression levels in aqueous humor decreased in Groups I, II, and III (p<0.05) but were unchanged in Group IV. In contrast, APP expression levels increased in Groups I, II, and III (p<0.05) compared with those in the healthy group but were unchanged in Group IV. H2O2-treated HLECs exhibited decreased amounts of Abeta 1-42 and increased amounts of APP. beta-secretase activity decreased in the lens epithelia of all four subgroups of ARCs compared with that in the lens epithelia of healthy subjects and decreased in H2O2-treated HLECs. Furthermore, treatment with nanomolar concentrations (0.2 nM to 10 nM) of Abeta could protect cell viability from oxidative damage. Conclusions: Abeta and APP expression levels exhibited differential changes during the development of ARC, indicating active feedback of this protein processing. Decreased expression of physiologically generated Abeta in the early and mid-stages of ARC development might be one of the potential mechanisms accelerating oxidative stress in HLECs during cataractogenesis.",

    "title": "Tuning the stereo-hindrance of a curcumin scaffold for the selective imaging of the soluble forms of amyloid beta species.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid peptides and proteins are associated with the pathologies of numerous diseases. In the progression of a disease, amyloids exist in soluble and insoluble forms, which are the dominant species at different stages of the disease and they have different degrees of toxicity. However, differentiating between the soluble and insoluble forms is very challenging with small molecule probes due to multiple obstacles that need to be overcome. Inspired by the recognition principle of antibodies for sAbeta, we hypothesized that the accessibility/tightness of soluble and insoluble amyloids could be utilized to design imaging probes to recognize different amyloid forms and the stereo-hindrance tuning strategy could be used to design imaging probes for selectively detecting the soluble amyloid beta (sAbeta) species in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we demonstrated that tuning the stereo-hindrance of the phenoxy-alkyl chains at the 4-position of a curcumin scaffold could lead to certain selectivity for sAbeta over insoluble Abetas (insAbeta). Among the designed compounds, CRANAD-102 showed a 68-fold higher affinity for sAbeta than for insAbeta (7.5 +- 10 nM vs. 505.9 +- 275.9 nM). Moreover, our imaging data indicated that CRANAD-102 was indeed capable of detecting sAbeta in vivo using 4 month old APP/PS1 mice, in which sAbeta is the predominant species in the brain. In addition, we also demonstrated that CRANAD-102 could be used to monitor the increase in sAbeta loading from the ages of 4 months old to 12 months old. We believe that CRANAD-102 can be a useful probe for selectively detecting sAbeta species in AD and that our probe designing strategy can be applied to other amyloids and will have tremendous impact on AD drug development and other amyloid research.",
