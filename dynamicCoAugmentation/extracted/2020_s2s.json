    "title": "Treatment of very large cranial defects with individually shaped polypropylene polyester knitwear prostheses: a series of 11 cases.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Very large cranial defects are not very common in neurosurgical practice and there is not any widely acknowledged standard of their treatment. One of the useful methods in such cases is individual forming of polypropylene-polyester knitwear. Such material was used in the past but before 2008 it was available only as standardized plates. Currently, it can be also produced as individually-shaped implants. The authors give their definition of very large cranial defects and present their experience with this cranioplastic method in such defects. METHODS: The authors collected data on 11 cases of patients with very large cranial defects, from a total of 156 cases, operated on in 5 Polish neurosurgical departments. The necessary implants were prepared for individual patients according to the data provided by a computed tomography examination and with the use of computer aided machining. RESULTS: All defects were larger than 120 cm2 (129 to 178 cm2) and exceeded 1/4 of the calvaria area. Patients were operated between 2008 to 2012. In all patients, a very good aesthetic result and correct skull reconstruction was achieved. The follow-up time in all cases exceeded 1 year and reached 4 years in one case. No complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Individually pre-shaped polypropylene-polyester knitwear prostheses are a good alternative to the existing cranioplasty methods, particularly in very large cranial defects.",

    "title": "The interaction of alpha-synuclein and Tau: A molecular conspiracy in neurodegeneration?",
    "abstract": "alpha-synuclein and Tau are proteins prone to pathological misfolding and aggregation that are normally found in the presynaptic and axonal compartments of neurons. Misfolding initiates a homo-oligomerization and aggregation cascade culminating in cerebral accumulation of aggregated alpha-synuclein and Tau in insoluble protein inclusions in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Traditionally, alpha-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies have been associated with Parkinson's disease and Tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles with Alzheimer's disease and various frontotemporal dementia syndromes. However, there is significant overlap and co-occurrence of alpha-synuclein and Tau pathologies in a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, alpha-synuclein and Tau can interact in cells, and their pathological conformations are capable of templating further misfolding and aggregation of each other. They also share a number of protein interactors indicating that network perturbations may contribute to chronic proteotoxic stress and neuronal dysfunction in synucleinopathies and tauopathies, some of which share similarities in both neuropathological and clinical manifestations. In this review, we focus on the protein interactions of these two pathologically important proteins and consider a network biology perspective towards neurodegenerative diseases.",

These include brain reserve, cognitive reserve, and brain maintenance. However, different investigators have use these terms in different ways, and there has never been an attempt to arrive at consensus on the definition of these concepts. Furthermore, there has been confusion regarding the measurement of these constructs and the appropriate ways to apply them to research. Therefore the reserve, resilience, and protective factors professional interest area, established under the auspices of the Alzheimer's Association, established a whitepaper workgroup to develop consensus definitions for cognitive reserve, brain reserve, and brain maintenance. The workgroup also evaluated measures that have been used to implement these concepts in research settings and developed guidelines for research that explores or utilizes these concepts. The workgroup hopes that this whitepaper will form a reference point for researchers in this area and facilitate research by supplying a common language.",

Using data for 149 participants (345 visits) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, we assessed whether the average of early amyloid frames (EA) and R1 computed from dynamic 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET can serve as surrogates of rCBF computed from 15O-H2O-PET. R1 had the highest longitudinal test-retest reliability. Interquartile range (IQR) of cross-sectional Pearson correlations with rCBF was 0.60-0.72 for EA and 0.63-0.72 for R1. Correlations between rates of change were lower (IQR 0.22-0.50 for EA, 0.25-0.55 for R1). Values in the Alzheimer's metabolic signature meta-ROI were negatively associated with age and exhibited longitudinal declines for each PET measure. In age-adjusted analyses, meta-ROI rCBF and R1 were lower among amyloid+ individuals; EA and R1 were lower among males. Regional PiB-based measures, in particular R1, can be suitable surrogates of rCBF. Dynamic PiB-PET may obviate the need for a separate scan to measure neuronal activity, thereby reducing patient burden, radioactivity exposure, and cost.",

We investigated the association between post-mortem iron levels with the clinical and pathological diagnosis of AD, its severity, and the rate of cognitive decline in the 12 years prior to death in subjects from the Memory and Aging Project (n = 209). Iron was elevated (beta [SE] = 9.7 [2.6]; P = 3.0 x 10-4) in the inferior temporal cortex only in subjects who were diagnosed with clinical AD during life and had a diagnosis of AD confirmed post-mortem by standardized criteria. Although iron was weakly associated with the extent of proteinopathy in tissue with AD neuropathology, it was strongly associated with the rate of cognitive decline (e.g., global cognition: beta [SE] = -0.040 [0.005], P = 1.6 x 10-14). Thus, cortical iron might act to propel cognitive deterioration upon the underlying proteinopathy of AD, possibly by inducing oxidative stress or ferroptotic cell death, or may be related to an inflammatory response.",

    "abstract": "Postsynaptic trafficking plays a key role in regulating synapse structure and function. While spiny excitatory synapses can be stable throughout adult life, their morphology and function is impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known about how AD risk genes impact synaptic function. Here we used structured superresolution illumination microscopy (SIM) to study the late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) risk factor BIN1, and show that this protein is abundant in postsynaptic compartments, including spines. While postsynaptic Bin1 shows colocalization with clathrin, a major endocytic protein, it also colocalizes with the small GTPases Rab11 and Arf6, components of the exocytic pathway. Bin1 participates in protein complexes with Arf6 and GluA1, and manipulations of Bin1 lead to changes in spine morphology, AMPA receptor surface expression and trafficking, and AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. Our data provide new insights into the mesoscale architecture of postsynaptic trafficking compartments and their regulation by a major LOAD risk factor.",

Using five control induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines and seven iPSC lines generated from fAD patients, we investigated the effects of mutations on the Abeta secretome in human neurons generated in 2D and 3D. We also analysed matched CSF, post-mortem brain tissue, and iPSCs from the same participant with the APP V717I mutation. All fAD mutation lines demonstrated an increased Abeta42:40 ratio relative to controls, yet displayed varied signatures for Abeta43, Abeta38, and short Abeta fragments. We propose four qualitatively distinct mechanisms behind raised Abeta42:40. (1) APP V717I mutations alter gamma-secretase cleavage site preference. Whereas, distinct presenilin 1 (PSEN1) mutations lead to either (2) reduced gamma-secretase activity, (3) altered protein stability or (4) reduced PSEN1 maturation, all culminating in reduced gamma-secretase carboxypeptidase-like activity. These data support Abeta mechanistic tenets in a human physiological model and substantiate iPSC-neurons for modelling fAD.",

Immunoprecipitation of these brain extracts with anti-Abeta oligomer antibodies or passive immunization of the recipient animals abrogated the observed seeding activity, although induced Abeta deposition was still evident. Here, we establish that, together with Abeta monomers, Abeta oligomers trigger the initial phase of Abeta seeding and that the depletion of oligomeric Abeta delays the aggregation process, leading to a transient reduction of seed-induced Abeta deposits. This work extends the current knowledge about the role of Abeta oligomers beyond its cytotoxic nature by pointing to a role in the initiation of Abeta aggregation in vivo.

    "abstract": "The \"two-hit vascular hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease (AD)\" and amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomer hypothesis suggest that impaired soluble Abeta oligomers clearance through the cerebral vasculature may be an initial step of the AD process. Soluble Abeta oligomers are driven into perivascular spaces from the brain parenchyma and toward peripheral blood flow. The underlying vascular-based mechanism, however, has not been defined. Given that microRNAs (miRNAs), emerging as novel modulators, are involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes, we hypothesized that cerebrovascular miRNAs may regulate the activities of brain blood vessels, which further affects the concentration of Abeta in the AD brain. In this study, perivascular Abeta deposits, higher vascular activation, increased pericyte coverage and up-regulated capillaries miRNAs at 6 months old (6 mo) were found to correlate with the lower Abeta levels of middle AD stage (9 mo) in 3xTg-AD (3xTg) mice. It is implicated that at the early stage of AD when intracellular Abeta appeared, higher expression of vessel-specific miRNAs, elevated pericyte coverage, and activated endothelium facilitate Abeta oligomer clearance through the perivascular route, resulting in a transient reduction of Abeta oligomers at 9 mo. Additionally, ghrelin-induced upregulation of capillary miRNAs and increased pericyte coverage attenuated Abeta burden at 9 mo, in further support of the relationship between vascular miRNAs and Abeta clearance. This work suggests a cerebral microvessel miRNA may boost endothelial highly activated phenotypes to promote elimination of Abeta oligomers through the perivascular drainage pathway and contribute to AD progression. The targeting of brain vessel-specific miRNAs may provide a new rationale for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies for AD treatment.",

    "title": "The role of cardiovascular disease in the relationship between air pollution and incident dementia: a population-based cohort study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests a link between air pollution and dementia. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) may be a potential determinant of dementia. This motivated us to quantify the contribution of CVD to the association between air pollution and dementia. METHODS: A cohort of Canadian-born residents of Ontario, who participated in the 1996-2003 Canadian Community Health Surveys, was followed through 2013 or until dementia diagnosis. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was estimated with a 3-year average and 5-year lag before dementia diagnosis. Incident CVD was evaluated as a mediator. We used multi-level Cox proportional and Aalen additive hazard regression models, adjusting for individual- and neighbourhood-level risk factors to estimate associations with NO2 and PM2.5. We estimated the total, direct and indirect effects of air pollution on dementia through cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: This study included 34 391 older adults. At baseline, the mean age of this cohort was 59 years. The risk of dementia was moderately higher among those more exposed to NO2 (hazard ratio (HR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-1.19; and 100 additional cases per 100 000 [standard error (SE) <100x10-5]) and PM2.5 [(HR 1.29, 95% CI 0.99-1.64; 200 additional cases per 100 000] [SE 100x10-5]) after adjusting for covariates; however, these estimates are imprecise. A greater proportion of the relationship between PM2.5 and dementia was mediated through CVD than NO2 for both scales. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest some of the association between air pollution and dementia is mediated through CVD, indicating that improving cardiovascular health may prevent dementia in areas with higher exposure to air pollution.",

    "title": "Neuropathologic basis of in vivo cortical atrophy in the aphasic variant of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "The neuropathologic basis of in vivo cortical atrophy in clinical dementia syndromes remains poorly understood. This includes primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a language-based dementia syndrome characterized by asymmetric cortical atrophy. The neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid-ss plaques (APs) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can cause PPA, but a quantitative investigation of the relationships between NFTs, APs and in vivo cortical atrophy in PPA-AD is lacking. The present study measured cortical atrophy from corresponding bilateral regions in five PPA-AD participants with in vivo magnetic resonance imaging scans 7-30 months before death and acquired stereologic estimates of NFTs and dense-core APs visualized with the Thioflavin-S stain. Linear mixed models accounting for repeated measures and stratified by hemisphere and region (language vs. non-language) were used to determine the relationships between cortical atrophy and AD neuropathology and their regional selectivity. Consistent with the aphasic profile of PPA, left language regions displayed more cortical atrophy (P = 0.01) and NFT densities (P = 0.02) compared to right language homologues. Left language regions also showed more cortical atrophy (P < 0.01) and NFT densities (P = 0.02) than left non-language regions. A subset of data was analyzed to determine the predilection of AD neuropathology for neocortical regions compared to entorhinal cortex in the left hemisphere, which showed that the three most atrophied language regions had greater NFT (P = 0.04) and AP densities (P < 0.01) than the entorhinal cortex. These results provide quantitative evidence that NFT accumulation in PPA selectively targets the language network and may not follow the Braak staging of neurofibrillary degeneration characteristic of amnestic AD. Only NFT densities, not AP densities, were positively associated with cortical atrophy within left language regions (P < 0.01) and right language homologues (P < 0.01). Given previous findings from amnestic AD, the current study of PPA-AD provides converging evidence that NFTs are the principal determinants of atrophy and clinical phenotypes associated with AD.",

    "title": "Aminoacid substitutions in the glycine zipper affect the conformational stability of amyloid beta fibrils.",
    "abstract": "The aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides is associated with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The hydrophobic core of the amyloid beta sequence contains a GxxxG repeated motif, called glycine zipper, which involves crucial residues for assuring stability and promoting the process of fibril formation. Mutations in this motif lead to a completely different oligomerization pathway and rate of fibril formation. In this work, we have tested G33L and G37L residue substitutions by molecular dynamics simulations. We found that both protein mutations may lead to remarkable changes in the fibril conformational stability. Results suggest the disruption of the glycine zipper as a possible strategy to reduce the aggregation propensity of amyloid beta peptides. On the basis of our data, further investigations may consider this key region as a binding site to design/discover novel effective inhibitors.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",

    "title": "Sex-specific hippocampal metabolic signatures at the onset of systemic inflammation with lipopolysaccharide in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Systemic inflammation enhances the risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent pro-inflammatory endotoxin produced by the gut, is found in excess levels in AD where it associates with neurological hallmarks of pathology. Sex differences in susceptibility to inflammation and AD progression have been reported, but how this impacts on LPS responses remains under investigated. We previously reported in an APP/PS1 model of AD that systemic LPS administration rapidly altered hippocampal metabolism in males. Here, we used untargeted metabolomics to comprehensively identify hippocampal metabolic processes occurring at onset of systemic inflammation with LPS (100 microg/kg, i.v.) in APP/PS1 mice, at an early pathological stage, and investigated the sexual dimorphism in this response. Four hours after LPS administration, pathways regulating energy metabolism, immune and oxidative stress responses were simultaneously recruited in the hippocampi of 4.5-month-old mice with a more protective response in females despite their pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant metabolic signature in the absence of immune stimulation. LPS induced comparable behavioural sickness responses in male and female wild-type and APP/PS1 mice and comparable activation of both the serotonin and nicotinamide pathways of tryptophan metabolism in their hippocampi. Elevations in N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, a major toxic metabolite of nicotinamide, correlated with behavioural sickness regardless of sex, as well as with the LPS-induced hypothermia seen in males. Males also exhibited a pro-inflammatory-like downregulation of pyruvate metabolism, exacerbated in APP/PS1 males, and methionine metabolism whereas females showed a greater cytokine response and anti-inflammatory-like downregulation of hippocampal methylglyoxal and methionine metabolism. Metabolic changes were not associated with morphological markers of immune cell activation suggesting that they constitute an early event in the development of LPS-induced neuroinflammation and AD exacerbation. These data suggest that the female hippocampus is more tolerant to acute systemic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease leading to progressive dementia in elderly people. The disease is characterized, among others, by formation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) polypeptide plaques in the brain. Although etiology of the disease is not fully understood, recent research suggest that nanomaterials may affect AD development. Here, we described the consequences of exposure of mouse BV-2 microglia to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs, 50 microg/mL), cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2NPs, 100 microg/mL), and cadmium telluride quantum dots (CdTeQDs, 3 or 10 microg/mL) in the context of its ability to clear Abeta plaques. The brain microglial cells play an important role in removing Abeta plaques from the brain. Cell viability and cycle progression were assessed by trypan blue test and propidium iodide binding, respectively. The uptake of Abeta and NPs was measured by flow cytometry. Secretion of proinflammatory cytokines was measured with the use of cytometric bead array. Abeta (0.1 muM) did not affect viability, whereas NPs decreased microglia growth by arresting the cells in G1 phase (CdTeQDs) or in S phase (AgNPs and CeO2NPs) of cell cycle. The uptake of Abeta was significantly reduced in the presence of AgNPs and CeO2NPs. In addition, the least toxic CeO2NPs induced the release of proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha. In summary, each of the NPs tested affected either the microglia phagocytic activity (AgNPs and CeO2NPs) and/or its viability (AgNPs and CdTeQDs) that may favor the occurrence of AD and accelerate its development.",

Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, major components of amyloid plaques and crucial pathogenic molecules in terms of the amyloid hypothesis, are derived from successive proteolytic processing of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP). In this study, we established a human neuronal culture system using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to evaluate the possible effects of natural compounds on the amyloid phenotype. Unexpectedly, we found that combinational treatment of carotenoids, but not docosahexaenoic acid, significantly decreased Abeta secretion from iPSC-derived human cortical neurons. Importantly, the effects of the carotenoids resulted from specific inhibition of BACE1 activity and not from expression changes in APP or BACE1. Therefore, these results indicate a novel beneficial function of carotenoids in the anti-amyloidogenic processing of APP. Collectively, this study will shed light on neuronal protection by a novel mechanism during the pathogenesis of AD.",

We aimed to investigate the ability of Abeta misfolding in blood plasma, APOE4 status, and dementia risk factors to predict diagnosis of AD.

Associations between Abeta misfolding, APOE4, and other predictors with clinical AD, vascular dementia, and mixed dementia diagnoses were assessed. RESULTS: Abeta misfolding was associated with a 23-fold increased odds of clinical AD diagnosis within 14 years. No association was observed with vascular dementia/mixed dementia diagnoses. APOE4-positive participants had a 2.4-fold increased odds of clinical AD diagnosis within 14 years.

    "abstract": "Although one of the defining characteristics of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques, the early accumulation of soluble Abeta oligomers (AbetaOs) may disrupt synaptic function and trigger cognitive impairments long before the appearance of plaques. Furthermore, murine models aimed at understanding how AbetaOs alter formation and retrieval of associative memories are conducted using human Abeta species, which are more neurotoxic in the mouse brain than the native murine species. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of attention in the literature as to what the murine version of the peptide (mAbeta) does to synaptic function and how it impacts the consolidation and retrieval of associative memories. In the current study, adult mice were infused with mAbeta 0, 2, 6, or 46 h after contextual-fear conditioning, and were tested 2-48 h later. Interestingly, only mAbeta infusions within 2 h of training reduced freezing behavior at test, indicating that mAbeta disrupted the consolidation, but not retrieval of fear memory. This consolidation deficit coincided with increased IL-1beta and reduced synaptophysin mRNA levels, without disrupting other synaptic signaling-related genes here examined. Despite differences between murine and human Abeta, the deleterious functional outcomes of early-stage synaptic oligomer presence are similar. Thus, models utilizing or inducing the production of mAbeta in non-transgenic animals are useful in exploring the role of dysregulated synaptic plasticity and resultant learning deficits induced by Abeta oligomers.",

The synthesis of polymer-peptide conjugates composed of the amyloidogenic Alzheimer peptide, Abeta1-40 , and poly(oligo(ethylene glycol)m acrylates) (m = 2,3) with different molecular weights (Mn = 1400-6600 g mol-1 ) is presented here. The challenging conjugation of a synthetic polymer to an in situ aggregating protein is established via two different coupling strategies, only successful for polymers with molecular weights not exceeding 6600 g mol-1 , relying on resin-based synthesis or solution-based coupling chemistries. The conjugates are characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The aggregation of these polymer-Abeta1-40 conjugates, as monitored via thioflavine-T (ThT)-fluorescence spectroscopy, is accelerated mainly upon attaching the polymers. However, the appearance of the observed fibrils is different from those composed of native Abeta1-40, specifically with respect to length and morphology of the obtained aggregates. Instead of long, unbranched fibrils characteristic for Abeta1-40 , bundles of short aggregates are observed for the conjugates. Finally, the ThT kinetics and morphologies of Abeta1-40 fibrils formed in the presence of the conjugates give some mechanistic insights.",

    "abstract": "Neurons are electrically excitable, postmitotic cells that perform sensory, relaying, and motor functions. Because of their unique morphological and functional specialization, cells of this type are sensitive to the stress caused by accumulation of misfolded proteins or damaged organelles. Autophagy is the fundamental mechanism that ensures sequestration of cytosolic material and its subsequent degradation in lysosomes of eukaryotic cells, thereby providing cell-autonomous nutrients and removing harmful cargos. Strikingly, mice and flies lacking functional autophagy develop early onset progressive neurodegeneration. Like in human neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs)-Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-characteristic protein aggregates observed in autophagy-deficient neurons in the animal models are indicators of the ongoing neuronal pathology. A number of selective autophagy receptors (SARs) have been characterized that interact both with the cargo and components of the autophagic machinery, thus providing the molecular basis for selective degradation of sizable cytosolic components. Interference with autophagy in experimental models, but also during the pathological vagaries in neurons, will thus have far-reaching consequences for a range of selective autophagy pathways critical for the normal functioning of the nervous system. Here, we review the key principles behind the selective autophagy and discuss how the SARs may be involved in the pathogenesis of NDDs. Using recently published examples, we also examine the emerging role of less well studied selective autophagy pathways in neuronal health and disease. We conclude by discussing targeting selective autophagy as an emerging therapeutic modality in NDDs.",

Therefore, it is likely that amyloid precursor protein and its proteolytic fragments other than amyloid b (Ab) contribute to the onset of AD. METHODS: We developed a sensitive assay adapted to the detection of C99, the direct precursor of b-amyloid. Three postmortem groups were studied: control with normal and stable cognition; patients with moderate AD, and individuals with severe AD. The amount of C99 and Abeta was quantified and correlated with the severity of AD. RESULTS: C99 accumulates in vulnerable neurons, and its levels correlate with the degree of cognitive impairment in patients suffering from AD. In contrast, Abeta levels are increased in both vulnerable and resistant brain areas. DISCUSSION: These results raise the possibility that C99, rather than Abeta plaques, is responsible for the death of nerve cells in AD.",

Lack of profound understanding of neural networking in normal brain and their interruption in AD makes the treatment of this neurodegenerative multifaceted disease a challenging issue. In recent years, mathematical and computational methods have paved the way towards a better understanding of the brain functional connectivity. Thus, much attention has been paid to this matter from both basic science researchers and clinicians with an interdisciplinary approach to determine what is not functioning properly in AD patients and how this malfunctioning can be addressed. In this review, a number of AD-related articles and well-studied pathophysiologic topics (e.g., amyloid-beta, neurofibrillary tangles, Ca2+ dysregulation, and synaptic plasticity alterations) has been literally surveyed from a computational and systems biology point of view. The neural networks were discussed from biological and mathematical point of views and their alterations in recent findings were further highlighted. Application of the graph theoretical analysis in the brain imaging was reviewed, depicting the relations between brain structure and function, without diving into mathematical details. Moreover, differential rate equations were briefly articulated, emphasizing the potential use of these equations in simplifying complex processes in relevance to pathologies of AD. Comprehensive insights were given into the AD progression from neural networks perspective, which may lead us towards potential strategies for early diagnosis and effective treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) senile plaques in patients' brain tissues. Elevated levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) have been identified in cerebrospinal fluid of living AD patients and in animal models of AD. Increased expression of IL-1beta and iron accumulation have been identified in microglial cells that cluster around amyloid plaques in AD mouse models and post-mortem brain tissues of AD patients. The goals of this study were to determine the effects of Abeta on the secretion of IL-1beta by microglial cells and whether iron status influences this pro-inflammatory signaling cue. Immortalized microglial (IMG) cells were incubated with Abeta with or without iron. qRT-PCR and western blot analyses showed that Abeta induces biosynthesis of IL-1beta by IMG cells. IMG cells secrete the mature form of IL-1beta in a caspase 1-dependent manner. Incubation with iron provoked a greater pro-inflammatory response. Inhibition of the iron transporter divalent metal transporter 1 protected IMG cells against Abeta-induced inflammation. Potentiation of Abeta-elicited IL-1beta induction by iron was also antagonized by ROS inhibitors, supporting the model that divalent metal transporter 1-mediated iron loading and subsequent increase in ROS contribute to the inflammatory effects of Abeta in microglia. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence microscopy indicate that iron enhances Abeta activation of NF-kappaB signaling to promote IL-1beta synthesis. These results support the hypothesis that Abeta stimulates IL-1beta expression by activating NF-kappaB signaling in microglia cells. Most importantly, iron appears to exacerbate the pro-inflammatory effects of Abeta to increase IL-1beta levels.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers are well-known toxic molecular species associated with Alzheimer's disease. Recent discoveries of the ability of amyloid fibril surfaces to convert soluble proteins into toxic oligomers suggested that these surfaces could serve as therapeutic targets for intervention. We have shown previously that a short helical peptide could be a key structural motif that can specifically recognize the K16-E22 region of the Abeta40 fibril surface with an affinity at the level of several micromolar. Here, we demonstrate that in-tether chiral center-induced helical stabilized peptides could also recognize the fibril surfaces, effectively inhibiting the surface-mediated oligomerization of Abeta40. Moreover, through extensive computational sampling, we observed two distinct ways in which the peptide inhibitors recognize the fibril surface. Apart from a binding mode that, in accord with the original design, involves hydrophobic side chains at the binding interface, we observed much more frequently another binding mode in which the hydrophobic staple interacts directly with the fibril surface. The affinity of the peptides for the fibril surface could be adjusted by tuning the hydrophobicity of the staple. The best candidate investigated here exhibits a submicromolar affinity (~0.75 muM). Collectively, this work opens an avenue for the rational design of candidate drugs with stapled peptides for amyloid-related disease.",

    "abstract": "Development of disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been challenging, with no drugs approved to date. The failures of several amyloid-targeted programs have led many to dismiss the amyloid beta (Abeta) hypothesis of AD. An antiamyloid antibody aducanumab recently showed modest but significant efficacy in a phase 3 trial, providing important validation of amyloid as a therapeutic target. However, the inconsistent results observed with aducanumab may be explained by the limited brain penetration and lack of selectivity for the soluble Abeta oligomers, which are implicated as upstream drivers of neurodegeneration by multiple studies. Development of agents that can effectively inhibit Abeta oligomer formation or block their toxicity is therefore warranted. An ideal drug would cross the blood-brain barrier efficiently and achieve sustained brain levels that can continuously prevent oligomer formation or inhibit their toxicity. A late-stage candidate with these attributes is ALZ-801, an oral drug with a favorable safety profile and high brain penetration that can robustly inhibit Abeta oligomer formation. An upcoming phase 3 trial with ALZ-801 in APOE4/4 homozygous patients with early AD will effectively test this amyloid oligomer hypothesis.",

Although recent evidence implicates that amyloid deposition in vivo is highly related to biomembranes, how the characteristic lipid components of neuronal membranes mediate this process remains to be fully elucidated. Herein, we established vesicle models to mimic exosomes and investigated their influence on the kinetics of Abeta(1-42) amyloidosis. By using ternary vesicles composed of three brain lipids monosialoganglioside GM1, cholesterol and sphingomyelin, we found that GM1 could regulate peptide fibrillation by facilitating the conformational transition of Abeta(1-42), and further quantitatively analyzed the influence of GM1-containing vesicles on the kinetics of Abeta(1-42) fibrillation. In addition, GM1-containing vesicles induced the formation of Abeta(1-42) fibrils at low concentrations, and these fibrils were toxic to PC12 cells. By analyzing the role of GM1 in this ternary mixture of membranes at the molecular level, we confirmed that GM1 clusters are presented as attachment sites for peptides, thus promoting the fibrillation of Abeta(1-42).",

    "abstract": "The mechanism by which a disordered peptide nucleates and forms amyloid is incompletely understood. A central domain of beta-amyloid (Abeta21-30) has been proposed to have intrinsic structural propensities that guide the limited formation of structure in the process of fibrillization. In order to test this hypothesis, we examine several internal fragments of Abeta, and variants of these either cyclized or with an N-terminal Cys. While Abeta21-30 and variants were always monomeric and unstructured (circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMRS)), we found that the addition of flanking hydrophobic residues in Abeta16-34 led to formation of typical amyloid fibrils. NMR showed no long-range nuclear overhauser effect (nOes) in Abeta21-30, Abeta16-34, or their variants, however. Serial 1 H-15 N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy, 1 H-1 H nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy, and 1 H-1 H total correlational spectroscopy spectra were used to follow aggregation of Abeta16-34 and Cys-Abeta16-34 at a site-specific level. The addition of an N-terminal Cys residue (in Cys-Abeta16-34) increased the rate of fibrillization which was attributable to disulfide bond formation. We propose a scheme comparing the aggregation pathways for Abeta16-34 and Cys-Abeta16-34, according to which Cys-Abeta16-34 dimerizes, which accelerates fibril formation. In this context, cysteine residues form a focal point that guides fibrillization, a role which, in native peptides, can be assumed by heterogeneous nucleators of aggregation.",

It also measured the extent to which age-related differences in cognition are driven by measurable brain pathology. All participants underwent neuropsychological assessment along with magnetic resonance imaging and Pittsburg compound B-positron emission tomography imaging for Abeta quantification. WMH severity was quantified using the age-related white matter changes scale. Stepwise regressions, moderation, and mediation modeling were performed. Our findings show that Abeta deposition single-handedly predicts poorer episodic memory performance and that Abeta and WMHs contribute additively to poorer performance in working memory and language while carrying synergistic associations with executive functions and attention. Through mediation modeling, we demonstrated that the influence of age over episodic memory, working memory, executive functions, and language is fully mediated by brain pathology. This study permits to conclude that, in healthy older adults, (1) Abeta burden and WMHs have synergistic associations with some cognitive domains and (2) age-related differences in most cognitive domains are driven by brain pathology associated with dementia.",

    "abstract": "Research has demonstrated that stress can exacerbate AD pathology in transgenic mouse models of AD. The purpose of the present studies was to extend this work by determining whether a social stressor, isolation stress, would increase the number of Abeta plaques in 5xFAD + transgenic mice in comparison to group-housed controls, and accelerate the onset of cognitive deficits in contextual fear-conditioning. Additionally, we aimed to determine whether the pathological impact of isolation stress could be prevented through exposure to exercise alone or to exercise and an enriched environment throughout the isolation period. Two-month-old 5xFAD + and 5xFAD- animals were isolated or group-housed for two and three months. An additional subset of 5xFAD + mice were housed in isolation, housed in isolation with an exercise wheel, or housed in isolation with an exercise wheel and an enriched environment. Both two and three months of isolation stress significantly increased the number of plaques in the hippocampus of 5xFAD + mice, and three months of isolation increased hippocampal BACE1 expression. Isolated animals also displayed a significant cognitive deficit in contextual fear-conditioning, independent of genotype. Furthermore, neither exercise nor an enriched environment were able to prevent these isolation-induced effects. Understanding how stress impacts the onset and progression of AD is critical, as many individuals endure significant stress over their lifespan, including prolonged social isolation, a societal trend likely to worsen with time.",

    "abstract": "Numerous observational studies have suggested that hormone therapy (HT) might protect postmenopausal women against cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, because of the significant disparity between results, especially those between observational and randomized controlled trials (RCT), this postulate remains unproven. A significant contributing factor to these inconsistencies is the loose use of the generic definitions of estrogens and progestogens with most studies not delineating the clear differences between non-endogenous and endogenously identical (bioidentical) hormones, their molecular binding affinities and actions, and resultant metabolites. This is highlighted by the generalized terminological use of HT, which is often used to encompass significantly disparate hormonal formulations without clear demarcation. This has impacted and continues to significantly influence interpretations of data, meta-analyses, observational studies, etc., relevant to AD. To progress forward and allow unbiased interpretation, it is no longer acceptable to group HT formulations together as a homogenous group. This will also allow differentiation between compounds that exhibit beneficial actions and those that do not and whether these effects are specific or generalized. The role of the endogenous hormones, 17 beta-oestradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4), in the development of sporadic AD in postmenopausal women is also examined.",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 mum (PM2.5) may increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Whether PM2.5 alters brain structure and accelerates the preclinical neuropsychological processes remains unknown. Early decline of episodic memory is detectable in preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal study to examine whether PM2.5 affects the episodic memory decline, and also explored the potential mediating role of increased neuroanatomic risk of Alzheimer's disease associated with exposure. Participants included older females (n = 998; aged 73-87) enrolled in both the Women's Health Initiative Study of Cognitive Aging and the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, with annual (1999-2010) episodic memory assessment by the California Verbal Learning Test, including measures of immediate free recall/new learning (List A Trials 1-3; List B) and delayed free recall (short- and long-delay), and up to two brain scans (MRI-1: 2005-06; MRI-2: 2009-10). Subjects were assigned Alzheimer's disease pattern similarity scores (a brain-MRI measured neuroanatomical risk for Alzheimer's disease), developed by supervised machine learning and validated with data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Based on residential histories and environmental data on air monitoring and simulated atmospheric chemistry, we used a spatiotemporal model to estimate 3-year average PM2.5 exposure preceding MRI-1. In multilevel structural equation models, PM2.5 was associated with greater declines in immediate recall and new learning, but no association was found with decline in delayed-recall or composite scores. For each interquartile increment (2.81 mug/m3) of PM2.5, the annual decline rate was significantly accelerated by 19.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.9% to 36.2%] for Trials 1-3 and 14.8% (4.4% to 24.9%) for List B performance, adjusting for multiple potential confounders. Long-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with increased Alzheimer's disease pattern similarity scores, which accounted for 22.6% (95% CI: 1% to 68.9%) and 10.7% (95% CI: 1.0% to 30.3%) of the total adverse PM2.5 effects on Trials 1-3 and List B, respectively. The observed associations remained after excluding incident cases of dementia and stroke during the follow-up, or further adjusting for small-vessel ischaemic disease volumes. Our findings illustrate the continuum of PM2.5 neurotoxicity that contributes to early decline of immediate free recall/new learning at the preclinical stage, which is mediated by progressive atrophy of grey matter indicative of increased Alzheimer's disease risk, independent of cerebrovascular damage.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that the inhibition of neuroinflammation is a potential target for therapeutic or preventive strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Chemerin has attracted particular attention for its role in the regulation of inflammation. In addition, amyloid beta1-42 (Abeta1-42) can interact with chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1), the receptor for chemerin, and induce microglial chemotaxis. Meanwhile, CMKLR1 is expressed in the brain, and both chemerin and Abeta1-42 share the same receptor. Thus, we hypothesized that chemerin (C9), a chemerin-derived nonapeptide, may have the potential to ameliorate Abeta1-42 mediated AD disease progression. The results showed that an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of C9 (8 microg/kg) facilitated memory formation and improved memory retention, as evidenced by the results of both the novel object recognition test (NOR) and object location recognition (OLR) tasks. These memory-enhancing effects of C9 were also observed after C9 (2 microg/kg) was infused into the hippocampus. Moreover, we found that treatment with C9 reversed the deficits in memory and learning ability induced by oligomeric Abeta1-42. Meanwhile, C9 also significantly inhibited Abeta1-42-induced increases in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the hippocampus. The same results were obtained for Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments. Finally, we observed that C9 did not affect locomotor activity, suggesting that its improvement of memory is not a false positive induced by hypolocomotion. In conclusion, C9 may facilitate memory formation, prolong memory retention, and ameliorate Abeta1-42-induced memory impairment, suggesting that C9 may potentially represent a novel strategy for the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Unawareness, or anosognosia, of memory deficits is a challenging manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that adversely affects a patient's safety and decision-making. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the presence, as well as the evolution, of altered awareness of memory function across the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD. Here, we aimed to characterize change in awareness of memory abilities and its relationship to beta-amyloid (Abeta) burden in a large cohort (N = 1,070) of individuals across the disease spectrum. METHODS: Memory awareness was longitudinally assessed (average number of visits = 4.3) and operationalized using the discrepancy between mean participant and partner report on the Everyday Cognition scale (memory domain). Abeta deposition was measured at baseline using [18F]florbetapir positron emission tomographic imaging. RESULTS: Abeta predicted longitudinal changes in memory awareness, such that awareness decreased faster in participants with increased Abeta burden. Abeta and clinical group interacted to predict change in memory awareness, demonstrating the strongest effect in dementia participants, but could also be found in the cognitively normal (CN) participants. In a subset of CN participants who progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), heightened memory awareness was observed up to 1.6 years before MCI diagnosis, with memory awareness declining until the time of progression to MCI (-0.08 discrepant-points/yr). In a subset of MCI participants who progressed to dementia, awareness was low initially and continued to decline (-0.23 discrepant-points/yr), reaching anosognosia 3.2 years before dementia onset. INTERPRETATION: Abeta burden is associated with a progressive decrease in self-awareness of memory deficits, reaching anosognosia approximately 3 years before dementia diagnosis.

Despite the observed co-pathology and concomitance of motor and cognitive phenotypes, the consequences of the primary amyloidogenic protein on the secondary pathologies remain poorly understood. To better define the relationship between alpha-syn and Abeta plaques, we injected alpha-syn preformed fibrils (alpha-syn mpffs) into mice with abundant Abeta plaques. Abeta deposits dramatically accelerated alpha-syn pathogenesis and spread throughout the brain. Remarkably, hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) was induced in alpha-syn mpff-injected 5xFAD mice. Finally, alpha-syn mpff-injected 5xFAD mice showed neuron loss that correlated with the progressive decline of cognitive and motor performance. Our findings suggest a \"feed-forward\" mechanism whereby Abeta plaques enhance endogenous alpha-syn seeding and spreading over time post-injection with mpffs.",

Hazard ratios using meta-analytic estimates were 5.47 (95% CI: 3.25-9.18) for MCI diagnosis and 4.49 (95% CI: 2.84-7.09) for Clinical Dementia Rating>0 in those with subtle decline (>-.14 to -.26 preclinical Alzheimer's cognitive composite standard deviations/year) on longitudinal cognitive testing. DISCUSSION: Early \"subtle cognitive decline\" among Abeta+ CN on a sensitive cognitive composite demonstrably increases risk for imminent clinical disease progression and functional impairment.",

    "abstract": "The three GxxxG repeating motifs from the C-terminal region of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide play a significant role in regulating the aggregation kinetics of the peptide. Mutation of these glycine residues to leucine greatly accelerates the fibrillation process but generates a varied toxicity profile. Using an array of biophysical techniques, we demonstrated the uniqueness of the composite glycine residues in these structural repeats. We used solvent relaxation NMR spectroscopy to investigate the role played by the surrounding water molecules in determining the corresponding aggregation pathway. Notably, the conformational changes induced by Gly33 and Gly37 mutations result in significantly decreased toxicity in a neuronal cell line. Our results indicate that G33 xxxG37 is the primary motif responsible for Abeta neurotoxicity, hence providing a direct structure-function correlation. Targeting this motif, therefore, can be a promising strategy to prevent neuronal cell death associated with Alzheimer's and other related diseases, such as type II diabetes and Parkinson's.",

    "abstract": "This work provides new insight into the age-related basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the composition of intraneuronal amyloid (iAbeta), and the mechanism of an age-related increase in iAbeta in adult AD-model mouse neurons. A new end-specific antibody for Abeta45 and another for aggregated forms of Abeta provide new insight into the composition of iAbeta and the mechanism of accumulation in old adult neurons from the 3xTg-AD model mouse. iAbeta levels containing aggregates of Abeta45 increased 30-50-fold in neurons from young to old age and were further stimulated upon glutamate treatment. iAbeta was 8 times more abundant in 3xTg-AD than non-transgenic neurons with imaged particle sizes following the same log-log distribution, suggesting a similar snow-ball mechanism of intracellular biogenesis. Pathologically misfolded and mislocalized Alz50 tau colocalized with iAbeta and rapidly increased following a brief metabolic stress with glutamate. AbetaPP-CTF, Abeta45, and aggregated Abeta colocalized most strongly with mitochondria and endosomes and less with lysosomes and autophagosomes. Differences in iAbeta by sex were minor. These results suggest that incomplete carboxyl-terminal trimming of long Abetas by gamma-secretase produced large intracellular deposits which limited completion of autophagy in aged neurons. Understanding the mechanism of age-related changes in iAbeta processing may lead to application of countermeasures to prolong dementia-free health span.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence highlights the central role of neurotoxic oligomers of the 42-residue-long beta-amyloid (Abeta42) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, very limited information is available on the structural transition from oligomer to fibril, particularly for pathologically relevant amyloids. To the best of our knowledge, we present here the first site-specific structural characterization of Abeta42 misfolding, from toxic oligomeric assembly yielding a similar conformation to an AD-associated Abeta42 oligomer, into a fibril. Transmission EM (TEM) analysis revealed that a spherical amyloid assembly (SPA) of Abeta42 with a 15.6 +- 2.1-nm diameter forms in a ~30-mum Abeta42 solution after a ~10-h incubation at 4  C, followed by a slow conversion into fibril at ~180 h. Immunological analysis suggested that the SPA has a surface structure similar to that of amylospheroid (ASPD), a patient-derived toxic Abeta oligomer, which had a diameter of 10-15 nm in negative-stain TEM. Solid-state NMR analyses indicated that the SPA structure involves a beta-loop-beta motif, which significantly differed from the triple-beta motif observed for the Abeta42 fibril. The comparison of the 13C chemical shifts of SPA with those of the fibril prepared in the above conditions and interstrand distance measurements suggested a large conformational change involving rearrangements of intermolecular beta-sheet into in-register parallel beta-sheet during the misfolding. A comparison of the SPA and ASPD 13C chemical shifts indicated that SPA is structurally similar to the ASPD relevant to AD. These observations provide insights into the architecture and key structural transitions of amyloid oligomers relevant for AD pathology.",

    "abstract": "The global epidemic of Alzheimer disease (AD) is worsening, and no approved treatment can revert or arrest progression of this disease. AD pathology is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Genetic data, as well as autopsy and neuroimaging studies in patients with AD, indicate that Abeta plaque deposition precedes cortical tau pathology. Because Abeta accumulation has been considered the initial insult that drives both the accumulation of tau pathology and tau-mediated neurodegeneration in AD, the development of AD therapeutics has focused mostly on removing Abeta from the brain. However, striking preclinical evidence from AD mouse models and patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cell models indicates that tau pathology can progress independently of Abeta accumulation and arises downstream of genetic risk factors for AD and aberrant metabolic pathways. This Review outlines novel insights from preclinical research that implicate apolipoprotein E, the endocytic system, cholesterol metabolism and microglial activation as Abeta-independent regulators of tau pathology. These factors are discussed in the context of emerging findings from clinical pathology, functional neuroimaging and other approaches in humans. Finally, we discuss the implications of these new insights for current Abeta-targeted strategies and highlight the emergence of novel therapeutic strategies that target processes upstream of both Abeta and tau.",

    "abstract": "Failure of Alzheimer's disease clinical trials to improve or stabilize cognition has led to the need for a better understanding of the driving forces behind cognitive decline in the presence of active disease processes. To dissect contributions of individual pathologies to cognitive function, we used the TgF344-AD rat model, which recapitulates the salient hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease pathology observed in patient populations (amyloid, tau inclusions, frank neuronal loss, and cognitive deficits). scyllo-Inositol treatment attenuated amyloid-beta peptide in disease-bearing TgF344-AD rats, which rescued pattern separation in the novel object recognition task and executive function in the reversal learning phase of the Barnes maze. Interestingly, neither activities of daily living in the burrowing task nor spatial memory in the Barnes maze were rescued by attenuating amyloid-beta peptide. To understand the pathological correlates leading to behavioural rescue, we examined the neuropathology and in vivo electrophysiological signature of the hippocampus. Amyloid-beta peptide attenuation reduced hippocampal tau pathology and rescued adult hippocampal neurogenesis and neuronal function, via improvements in cross-frequency coupling between theta and gamma bands. To investigate mechanisms underlying the persistence of spatial memory deficits, we next examined neuropathology in the entorhinal cortex, a region whose input to the hippocampus is required for spatial memory. Reduction of amyloid-beta peptide in the entorhinal cortex had no effect on entorhinal tau pathology or entorhinal-hippocampal neuronal network dysfunction, as measured by an impairment in hippocampal response to entorhinal stimulation. Thus, rescue or not of cognitive function is dependent on regional differences of amyloid-beta, tau and neuronal network dysfunction, demonstrating the importance of staging disease in patients prior to enrolment in clinical trials. These results further emphasize the need for combination therapeutic approaches across disease progression.",

We investigated their incidence in a population-based cohort. METHODS: Using a records-linkage system, we identified all patients with a diagnostic code for dementia in Olmsted County, MN, 1995-2010, and confirmed the diagnosis of FTD. A behavioral neurologist verified the clinical diagnosis and determined phenotypes. RESULTS: We identified 35 FTDs cases. Overall, the incidence of FTDs was 4.3/100,000/year (95% CI: 2.9, 5.7). Incidence was higher in men (6.3/100,000, 95% CI 3.6, 9.0) than women (2.9/100,000; 95% CI: 1.3, 4.5); we observed an increased trend over time (B = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.54, 1.11, P < .001).

METHODS: We included 218 VCD patients with available cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 levels. Patients were divided into Abeta+ mild-VCD (n = 84), Abeta- mild-VCD (n = 68), Abeta+ major-VCD (n = 31), and Abeta- major-VCD (n = 35). We measured depression with the Geriatric Depression Scale, cognition with a neuropsychological test battery and derived white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and gray matter atrophy from MRI. RESULTS: Abeta- patients showed more depressive symptoms than Abeta+. In the major-VCD group, Abeta- patients performed worse on attention (P = .02) and executive functioning (P = .008) than Abeta+. We found no cognitive differences in patients with mild VCD. In the mild-VCD group, Abeta- patients had more WMH than Abeta+ patients, whereas conversely, in the major-VCD group, Abeta+ patients had more WMH. Atrophy patterns did not differ between Abeta+ and Abeta- VCD group. DISCUSSION: Comorbid Abeta pathology affects the manifestation of VCD, but effects differ by severity of VCD.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregates induced by Cu2+/Zn2+ in conjunction with toxicity is closely related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, we intended to improve the efficiency and selectivity of traditional chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) combined with a fluorescent group 4-aminosalicylic acid (4-ASA)to acquire a novel potential chelator 4,4'-((2,2'-(ethane-1,2-diylbis((carboxymethyl)azanediyl))bis(acetyl))bis(azanediyl))bis(2-hydroxybenzoic acid) (EDTA-ASA) capable of disaggregating Abeta-Cu(II)/ Zn(II) aggregates. EDTA-ASA combines 4-ASA as fluorophore and multidentate amino nitrogen, hydroxyl and carboxyl groups to chelate Cu2+ from Abeta-Cu (II) aggregates. The specific selectivity of EDTA-ASA towards Cu2+ in Tris-HCl buffer solution was investigated by fluorescence measurements. It exhibits high recognition towards Cu2+ with no significant interference of other competitive metal ions, which overcomes the deficiencies of EDTA. Importantly, the binding sites and binding mode for Cu2+ were clarified through DFT calculations. The thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence analyses and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results have revealed EDTA-ASA exhibited an enhanced disaggregation capability on Abeta-Cu (II)/Zn (II) aggregates in comparison to EDTA. The Cu2+ chelating affinity was sufficient for EDTA-ASA to sequester Cu2+ from Abeta-Cu (II) aggregates.",

    "abstract": "Targeted overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), an amyloid-beta protein degrading enzyme, to brain resident microglia and peripheral myelomonocytes (ACE10 model) substantially diminished Alzheimer's-like disease in double-transgenic APPSWE/PS1DeltaE9 (AD+) mice. In this study, we explored the impact of selective and transient angiotensin-converting enzyme overexpression on macrophage behaviour and the relative contribution of bone marrow-derived ACE10 macrophages, but not microglia, in attenuating disease progression. To this end, two in vivo approaches were applied in AD+ mice: (i) ACE10/GFP+ bone marrow transplantation with head shielding; and (ii) adoptive transfer of CD115+-ACE10/GFP+ monocytes to the peripheral blood. Extensive in vitro studies were further undertaken to establish the unique ACE10-macrophage phenotype(s) in response to amyloid-beta1-42 fibrils and oligomers. The combined in vivo approaches showed that increased cerebral infiltration of ACE10 as compared to wild-type monocytes (~3-fold increase; P < 0.05) led to reductions in cerebral soluble amyloid-beta1-42, vascular and parenchymal amyloid-beta deposits, and astrocytosis (31%, 47-80%, and 33%, respectively; P < 0.05-0.0001). ACE10 macrophages surrounded brain and retinal amyloid-beta plaques and expressed 3.2-fold higher insulin-like growth factor-1 (P < 0.01) and ~60% lower tumour necrosis factor-alpha (P < 0.05). Importantly, blood enrichment with CD115+-ACE10 monocytes in symptomatic AD+ mice resulted in pronounced synaptic and cognitive preservation (P < 0.05-0.001). In vitro analysis of macrophage response to well-defined amyloid-beta1-42 conformers (fibrils, prion rod-like structures, and stabilized soluble oligomers) revealed extensive resistance to amyloid-beta1-42 species by ACE10 macrophages. They exhibited 2-5-fold increased surface binding to amyloid-beta conformers as well as substantially more effective amyloid-beta1-42 uptake, at least 8-fold higher than those of wild-type macrophages (P < 0.0001), which were associated with enhanced expression of surface scavenger receptors (i.e. CD36, scavenger receptor class A member 1, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, CD163; P < 0.05-0.0001), endosomal processing (P < 0.05-0.0001), and ~80% increased extracellular degradation of amyloid-beta1-42 (P < 0.001). Beneficial ACE10 phenotype was reversed by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril) and thus was dependent on angiotensin-converting enzyme catalytic activity. Further, ACE10 macrophages presented distinct anti-inflammatory (low inducible nitric oxide synthase and lower tumour necrosis factor-alpha), pro-healing immune profiles (high insulin-like growth factor-1, elongated cell morphology), even following exposure to Alzheimer's-related amyloid-beta1-42 oligomers. Overall, we provide the first evidence for therapeutic roles of angiotensin-converting enzyme-overexpressing macrophages in preserving synapses and cognition, attenuating neuropathology and neuroinflammation, and enhancing resistance to defined pathognomonic amyloid-beta forms.",

However, almost no deposition of Abeta in the peripheral tissues could be found. Human serum albumin (HSA), the most abundant protein in the blood, has been reported to inhibit amyloid formation through binding Abeta, which is believed to play an important role in the peripheral clearance of Abeta. We identified the Abeta binding site on HSA and developed HSA mutants with high binding capacities for Abeta using a phage display method. HSA fragment 187-385 (Domain II) was found to exhibit the highest binding capacity for Abeta compared with the other two HSA fragments. To elucidate the sequence that forms the binding site for Abeta on Domain II, a random screening of Domain II display phage biopanning was constructed. A number of mutants with higher Abeta binding capacities than the wild type were identified. These mutants exhibited stronger scavenging abilities than the wild type, as revealed via in vitro equilibrium dialysis of Abeta experiments. These findings provide useful basic data for developing a safer alternative therapy than Abeta vaccines and for application in plasma exchange as well as extracorporeal dialysis.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta42 are considered interchangeable for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical reasoning for requesting additional amyloid-beta PET after performing CSF biomarkers. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 72 memory clinic patients who underwent amyloid-beta PET after CSF biomarkers analysis for clinical diagnostic evaluation between 2011 and 2019. We performed patient chart reviews to identify factors which led to additional amyloid-beta PET. Additionally, we assessed accordance with appropriate-use-criteria (AUC) for amyloid-beta PET. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 62.0 (SD = 8.1) and mean Mini-Mental State Exam score was 23.6 (SD = 3.8). CSF analysis conflicting with the clinical diagnosis was the most frequent reason for requesting an amyloid-beta PET scan (n = 53, 74%), followed by incongruent MRI (n = 16, 22%), unusual clinical presentation (n = 11, 15%) and young age (n = 8, 11%). An amyloid-beta PET scan was rarely (n = 5, 7%) requested in patients with a CSF Abeta+/tau+ status. Fifteen (47%) patients with a post-PET diagnosis of AD had a predominantly non-amnestic presentation. In n = 11 (15%) cases, the reason that the clinician requested amyloid-beta was not covered by AUC. This happened most often (n = 7) when previous CSF analysis did not support current clinical diagnosis, which led to requesting amyloid-beta PET. CONCLUSION: In this single-center study, the main reason for requesting an amyloid-beta PET scan after performing CSF biomarkers was the occurrence of a mismatch between the primary clinical diagnosis and CSF Abeta/tau results.",

OBJECTIVE: To examine associations of Abeta and brain microstructure with cognitive decline in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and dementia. METHODS: Restriction spectrum imaging, cerebrospinal fluid Abeta, and longitudinal cognitive data were collected on 23 healthy controls and 13 individuals with mild cognitive impairment or mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Neurite density (ND) and isotropic free water diffusion (IF) were computed in fiber tracts and cortical regions of interest. We examined associations of Abeta with regional and whole-brain microstructure, and assessed whether microstructure mediates effects of Abeta on cognitive decline. RESULTS: Lower ND in limbic and association fibers and higher medial temporal lobe IF predicted baseline impairment and longitudinal decline across multiple cognitive domains. ND and IF predicted cognitive outcomes after adjustment for Abeta or whole-brain microstructure. Correlations between microstructure and cognition were present for both amyloid-positive and amyloid-negative individuals. Abeta correlated with whole-brain, rather than regional, ND and IF. CONCLUSION: Abeta correlates with widespread microstructural brain changes, whereas regional microstructure correlates with cognitive decline. Microstructural abnormalities predict cognitive decline regardless of amyloid, and may inform about neural injury leading to cognitive decline beyond that attributable to amyloid.",

    "abstract": "Proteasome malfunction parallels abnormal amyloid accumulation in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Here we scrutinize a small library of pyrazolones by assaying their ability to enhance proteasome activity and protect neuronal cells from amyloid toxicity. Tube tests evidenced that aminopyrine and nifenazone behave as 20S proteasome activators. Enzyme assays carried out on an \"open gate\" mutant (alpha3DeltaN) proteasome demonstrated that aminopyrine activates proteasome through binding the alpha-ring surfaces and influencing gating dynamics. Docking studies coupled with STD-NMR experiments showed that H-bonds and pi-pi stacking interactions between pyrazolones and the enzyme play a key role in bridging alpha1 to alpha2 and, alternatively, alpha5 to alpha6 subunits of the outer alpha-ring. Aminopyrine and nifenazone exhibit neurotrophic properties and protect differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells from beta-amyloid (Abeta) toxicity. ESI-MS studies confirmed that aminopyrine enhances Abeta degradation by proteasome in a dose-dependent manner.

    "abstract": "Dementia frequently occurs in Down syndrome (DS) patients, and early intervention is important in its management. We have previously demonstrated a positive correlation of plasma beta-amyloid Abeta42 levels and negative correlations of Abeta40 and tau levels with dementia in DS. In this study, we examined more cases and constructed composite scores with both tau and amyloids to correlate with dementia in DS. Plasma Abeta42, Abeta40, and tau proteins were measured by an immunomagnetic reduction assay in DS patients. Data were randomly and repeatedly split into training and validating sets, and logistic regression was applied to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) for each biomarker. A total of 73 DS patients (among them, 23 had neurodegeneration) and 77 controls were recruited. In DS patients without dementia, plasma Abeta40 and tau levels were highly elevated, but Abeta42 levels were lower than those of the healthy controls. DS patients with dementia, compared with DS patients with no dementia, had a large decline in Abeta40 and tau but a rise in Abeta42. For biomarker scores correlating with dementia, Abeta40 revealed an AUC of 0.912; the composite score of Abeta40 x tau revealed an AUC of 0.953; and a combined composite score of 0.1 for Abeta40 x Tau +0.9 Tau x Abeta40/Abeta42 achieved the highest AUC of 0.965. Therefore, composite biomarker scores including both plasma tau and beta-amyloid levels correlate with dementia in DS better than using individual biomarker scores. The pattern of tau decline and Abeta42 rise in DS patients with dementia are also different from previous findings in Alzheimer's disease.",

This progressive neurodegenerative disease affects over 44 million people worldwide. However, very few synthesized drug molecules are available to inhibit the aggregation of Abeta. Recently, experimental studies have shown that the biological ATP molecule prevents Abeta fibrillation at the millimolar scale; however, the significance of ATP molecules on Abeta fibrillation and the mechanism behind it remain elusive. We have carried out a total of 7.5 mus extensive all-atom molecular dynamics and 8.82 mus of umbrella sampling in explicit water using AMBER14SB, AMBER99SB-ILDN, and AMBER-FB15 force fields for Abeta16-22 peptide, to investigate the role of ATP on the disruption of Abeta16-22 prefibrils. From various analyses, such as secondary structure analysis, residue-wise contact map, SASA, and interaction energies, we have observed that, in the presence of ATP, the aggregation of Abeta16-22 peptide is very unfavorable. Moreover, the biological molecule ATP interacts with the Abeta16-22 peptide via hydrogen bonding, pi-pi stacking, and NH-pi interactions which, ultimately, prevent the aggregation of Abeta16-22 peptide. Hence, we assume that the deficiency of ATP may cause Alzheimer's disease (AD).",

    "abstract": "Temporal lobe epilepsy represents a major cause of drug-resistant epilepsy. Cognitive impairment is a frequent comorbidity, but the mechanisms are not fully elucidated. We hypothesized that the cognitive impairment in drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy could be due to perturbations of amyloid and tau signalling pathways related to activation of stress kinases, similar to those observed in Alzheimer's disease. We examined these pathways, as well as amyloid-beta and tau pathologies in the hippocampus and temporal lobe cortex of drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy patients who underwent temporal lobe resection (n = 19), in comparison with age- and region-matched samples from neurologically normal autopsy cases (n = 22). Post-mortem temporal cortex samples from Alzheimer's disease patients (n = 9) were used as positive controls to validate many of the neurodegeneration-related antibodies. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis of tissue from temporal lobe epilepsy cases revealed increased phosphorylation of full-length amyloid precursor protein and its associated neurotoxic cleavage product amyloid-beta*56. Pathological phosphorylation of two distinct tau species was also increased in both regions, but increases in amyloid-beta1-42 peptide, the main component of amyloid plaques, were restricted to the hippocampus. Furthermore, several major stress kinases involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease pathology were significantly activated in temporal lobe epilepsy brain samples, including the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and the protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase. In temporal lobe epilepsy cases, hippocampal levels of phosphorylated amyloid precursor protein, its pro-amyloidogenic processing enzyme beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, and both total and hyperphosphorylated tau expression, correlated with impaired preoperative executive function. Our study suggests that neurodegenerative and stress-related processes common to those observed in Alzheimer's disease may contribute to cognitive impairment in drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. In particular, we identified several stress pathways that may represent potential novel therapeutic targets.",

Understanding the regional-temporal evolution of amyloid pathology may enable earlier identification of subjects in the Alzheimer Disease pathologic continuum, as well as a finer-grained assessment of pathology beyond traditional dichotomous measures. This review summarizes current research in the detection of regional amyloid deposition patterns and its potential for staging amyloid pathology. Pathology studies, cross-sectional and longitudinal PET-only studies, and comparative PET and autopsy studies are included. Despite certain differences, cortical deposition generally precedes striatal pathology, and in PET-only studies, medial cortical regions are seen to accumulate amyloid earlier than lateral regions. Based on regional amyloid PET, multiple studies have developed and implemented models for staging amyloid pathology that could improve subject selection into secondary prevention trials and visual assessment in clinical routine.",

It was previously shown that a short fragment of Abeta peptide (KLVFF, 16-20) bound Abeta inhibited its aggregation. In this work, using KLVFF peptide, we synthesized two peptide families and then evaluated their inhibitory capacities by conventional assays such as thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence spectroscopy, turbidity measurement, and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS). The effect of peptide terminal groups on its inhibitory activity was first studied. Subsequently, the influence of halogenated amino acids on peptide anti-aggregation properties was investigated. We found that iodinated peptide with amine in the N and amide in the C termini, respectively, was the best inhibitor of Abeta fibers formation. Halogenated peptides seemed to decrease the number of Abeta fibrils; however, they did not reduce Abeta cytotoxicity. The data obtained in this work seemed promising in developing potential peptide drugs for treatment of AD.",

    "title": "Effect of atorvastatin on Abeta1-42 -induced alteration of SESN2, SIRT1, LC3II and TPP1 protein expressions in neuronal cell cultures.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Sestrins (SESNs) and sirtuins (SIRTs) are antioxidant and antiapoptotic genes and crucial mediators for lysosomal autophagy regulation that play a pivotal role in the Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, statins have been linked to the reduced prevalence of AD in statin-prescribed populations yet molecular basis for the neuroprotective action of statins is still under debate. METHODS: This study was undertaken whether Abeta-induced changes of SESN2 and SIRT1 protein expression, autophagy marker LC3II and lysosomal enzyme TPP1 affected by atorvastatin (Western blot) and its possible role in Abeta neurotoxicity (ELISA). KEY FINDINGS/RESULTS: We showed that SESN2 and LC3II expressions were elevated, whereas SIRT1 and TPP1 expressions were decreased in the Abeta1-42 -exposed human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). Co-administration of atorvastatin with Abeta1-42 compensates SESN2 increase and recovers SIRT1 decline by reducing oxidative stress, decreasing SESN2 expression and increasing SIRT1 expression by its neuroprotective action. Atorvastatin induced LC3II but not TPP1 level in the Abeta1-42 -exposed cells suggested that atorvastatin is effective in the formation of autophagosome but not on the expression of the specific lysosomal enzyme TPP1. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Together, these results indicate that atorvastatin induced SESN2, SIRT1 and LC3II levels play a protective role against Abeta1-42 neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Aggregations of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and alpha-synuclein (alphaS) into oligomeric and fibrillar assemblies are the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, respectively. Although Abeta and alphaS affect different regions of the brain and are separated at the cellular level, there is evidence of their eventual interaction in the pathology of both disorders. Characterization of interactions of Abeta and alphaS at various stages of their aggregation pathways could reveal mechanisms and therapeutic targets for the prevention and cure of these neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we comprehensively examined the interactions and their molecular manifestations using an array of characterization tools. We show for the first time that alphaS monomers and oligomers, but not alphaS fibrils, inhibit Abeta fibrillization while promoting oligomerization of Abeta monomers and stabilizing preformed Abeta oligomers via coassembly, as judged by Thioflavin T fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and SDS- and native-PAGE with fluorescently labeled peptides/proteins. In contrast, soluble Abeta species, such as monomers and oligomers, aggregate into fibrils, when incubated alone under the otherwise same condition. Our study provides evidence that the interactions with alphaS soluble species, responsible for the effects, are mediated primarily by the C-terminus of Abeta, when judged by competitive immunoassays using antibodies recognizing various fragments of Abeta. We also show that the C-terminus of Abeta is a primary site for its interaction with alphaS fibrils. Collectively, these data demonstrate aggregation state-specific interactions between alphaS and Abeta and offer insight into a molecular basis of synergistic biological effects between the two polypeptides.",

Conformational constraints in such peptidic scaffolds affect their copper-binding affinity, which can be tuned. In the present study, the ability of these peptides to compete with Abeta has been assessed in vitro, with the objective to examine whether such soft chelating agents may be used to lessen the deleterious interaction of Cu(II) with Abeta. Fluorescence spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry data show that the more constrained peptide, i.e., cyclic C-Asp, which displays a Cu(II)-binding affinity comparable to that of Abeta, is the only potential metal-protein attenuating compound (MPAC) candidate. In vitro aggregation studies with Abeta(1-40) reveal that C-Asp can hamper the formation of copper-stabilized oligomeric Abeta species, through capturing the metal ion prior to its interaction with monomeric Abeta. The present study shows that (cyclic) peptides, preorganized for Cu(II) binding, may be applied for the development of potential copper-Abeta attenuating compounds.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Many microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be aberrantly expressed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The present study aimed to explore the diagnostic value and neuroprotective role of miR-193a-3p in AD. METHODS: 108 sporadic AD patients and 93 healthy controls were included. An Abeta25-35 insult cellular AD model of PC12 and SH-SY5Y was established. The relative expression levels of miR-193a-3p were calculated using qRT-PCR. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was applied to evaluate the usefulness of miR-193a-3p for detecting AD. Cell viability and apoptotic rates were calculated. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the interaction between miR-193a-3p and PTEN. RESULTS: miR-193a-3p expression was downregulated in both AD patients and the cellular AD model (all P < 0.001). Remarkable positive association was detected between serum miR-193a-3p level and MMSE score in AD patients (r = 0.5889, P < 0.0001). The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 89.8% and 77.4%, respectively, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.914. Overexpression of miR-193a-3p weakened Abeta25-35 induced cell viability inhibition, and reduced Abeta25-35 induced cell apoptosis in PC12 cells (all P < 0.01). Downregulation of miR-193a-3p intensified the effect of Abeta25-35 PTEN was proved to be the target gene of miR-193a-3p. CONCLUSION: MiR-193a-3p could be a novel biomarker for AD diagnosis, and may protect against neurotoxicity in AD by targeting PTEN.",

    "title": "Automatic identification of crossovers in cryo-EM images of murine amyloid protein A fibrils with machine learning.",
    "abstract": "Detecting crossovers in cryo-electron microscopy images of protein fibrils is an important step towards determining the morphological composition of a sample. Currently, the crossover locations are picked by hand, which introduces errors and is a time-consuming procedure. With the rise of deep learning in computer vision tasks, the automation of such problems has become more and more applicable. However, because of insufficient quality of raw data and missing labels, neural networks alone cannot be applied successfully to target the given problem. Thus, we propose an approach combining conventional computer vision techniques and deep learning to automatically detect fibril crossovers in two-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy image data and apply it to murine amyloid protein A fibrils, where we first use direct image processing methods to simplify the image data such that a convolutional neural network can be applied to the remaining segmentation problem. LAY DESCRIPTION: The ability of protein to form fibrillary structures underlies important cellular functions but can also give rise to disease, such as in a group of disorders, termed amyloid diseases. These diseases are characterised by the formation of abnormal protein filaments, so-called amyloid fibrils, that deposit inside the tissue. Many amyloid fibrils are helically twisted, which leads to periodic variations in the apparent width of the fibril, when observing amyloid fibrils using microscopy techniques like cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Due to the two-dimensional projection, parts of the fibril orthogonal to the projection plane appear narrower than parts parallel to the plane. The parts of small width are called crossovers. The distance between two adjacent crossovers is an important characteristic for the analysis of amyloid fibrils, because it is informative about the fibril morphology and because it can be determined from raw data by eye. A given protein can typically form different fibril morphologies. The morphology can vary depending on the chemical and physical conditions of fibril formation, but even when fibrils are formed under identical solution conditions, different morphologies may be present in a sample. As the crossovers allow to define fibril morphologies in a heterogeneous sample, detecting crossovers is an important first step in the sample analysis. In the present paper, we introduce a method for the automated detection of fibril crossovers in cryo-EM image data. The data consists of greyscale images, each showing an unknown number of potentially overlapping fibrils. In a first step, techniques from image analysis and pattern detection are employed to detect single fibrils in the raw data. Then, a convolutional neural network is used to find the locations of crossovers on each single fibril. As these predictions may contain errors, further postprocessing steps assess the quality and may slightly alter or reject the predicted crossovers.",

    "abstract": "The consistent observation of phosphorylated tau in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease has contributed to the emergence of a model where hyperphosphorylation triggers both tau disassociation from microtubules and its subsequent aggregation. Herein, we applied a total chemical synthetic approach to site-specifically phosphorylate the microtubule binding repeat domain of tau (K18) at single (pS356) or multiple (pS356/pS262 and pS356/pS262/pS258) residues. We show that hyperphosphorylation of K18 inhibits 1) its aggregation in vitro, 2) its seeding activity in cells, 3) its binding to microtubules, and 4) its ability to promote microtubule polymerization. The inhibition increased with increasing the number of phosphorylated sites, with phosphorylation at S262 having the strongest effect. Our results argue against the hyperphosphorylation hypothesis and underscore the importance of revisiting the role of site-specific hyperphosphorylation in regulating tau functions in health and disease.",

    "title": "Structural Interaction of Apolipoprotein A-I Mimetic Peptide with Amyloid-beta Generates Toxic Hetero-oligomers.",
    "abstract": "Apolipoproteins are involved in pathological conditions of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and it has been reported that truncated apolipoprotein fragments and beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides coexist as neurotoxic heteromers within the plaques. Therefore, it is important to investigate these complexes at the molecular level to better understand their properties and roles in the pathology of AD. Here, we present a mechanistic insight into such heteromerization using a structurally homologue apolipoprotein fragment of apoA-I (4F) complexed with Abeta(M1-42) and characterize their toxicity. The 4F peptide slows down the aggregation kinetics of Abeta(M1-42) by constraining its structural plasticity. NMR and CD experiments identified 4F-Abeta(M1-42) heteromers comprised of unstructured Abeta(M1-42) and helical 4F. A uniform two-fold reduction in 15N/1H NMR signal intensities of Abeta(M1-42) with no observable chemical shift perturbation indicated the formation of a large complex, which was further confirmed by diffusion NMR experiments. Microsecond-scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations showed that 4F interaction with Abeta(M1-42) is electrostatically driven and induces unfolding of Abeta(M1-42). Neurotoxicity profiling of Abeta(M1-42) complexed with 4F confirms a significant reduction in cell viability and neurite growth. Thus, the molecular architecture of heteromerization between 4F and Abeta(M1-42) discovered in this study provides evidence toward our understanding of the role of apolipoproteins or their truncated fragments in exacerbating AD pathology.",

    "title": "Soluble Abeta oligomers and protofibrils induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation in microglia.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder causing memory loss, language problems and behavioural disturbances. AD is associated with the accumulation of fibrillar amyloid-beta (Abeta) and the formation of neurofibrillary tau tangles. Fibrillar Abeta itself represents a danger-associated molecular pattern, which is recognized by specific microglial receptors. One of the key players is formation of the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, whose activation has been demonstrated in AD patient brains and transgenic animal models of AD. Here, we investigated whether Abeta oligomers or protofibrils that represent lower molecular aggregates prior to Abeta deposition are able to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) release by microglia. In our study, we used Abeta preparations of different sizes: small oligomers and protofibrils of which the structure was confirmed by atomic force microscopy. Primary microglial cells from C57BL/6 mice were treated with the respective Abeta preparations and NLRP3 inflammasome activation, represented by caspase-1 cleavage, IL-1beta production, and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD speck formation was analysed. Both protofibrils and low molecular weight Abeta aggregates induced a significant increase in IL-1beta release. Inflammasome activation was confirmed by apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD speck formation and detection of active caspase-1. The NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 completely inhibited the Abeta-induced immune response. Our results show that the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated not only by fibrillar Abeta aggregates as reported before, but also by lower molecular weight Abeta oligomers and protofibrils, highlighting the possibility that microglial activation by these Abeta species may initiate innate immune responses in the central nervous system prior to the onset of Abeta deposition.

However, their exact roles in the mechanisms of AD progression are not well established. Given that AD is a disconnection syndrome and hypometabolism is one of its most important neurodegenerative indicators, we hypothesized amyloid-beta and tau burden may disturb the glucose metabolic network of AD. Here we investigated the relationship of these two factors to regional metabolic network properties using multimodal positron emission tomography (PET) imaging data. Participants included six groups covering from cognitively normal controls, patients with early cognitive impairment (MCI), late MCI, mild AD, moderate AD to severe AD who underwent amyloid-beta PET, tau PET and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET. Glucose metabolic network of each group was constructed and relations of amyloid-beta and tau to regional metabolic network measurements were investigated. Results revealed distinct associations of these two hallmarks to metabolic networks: amyloid-beta were positively related to metabolic network measurements at relative early phases of AD, while tau burden showed a negative relationship at late phase of AD. These results supported the notion that amyloid-beta and tau accumulation may contribute independently to mechanisms of AD. Furthermore, these findings might also provide connectivity evidence for the speculation that amyloid-beta deposition is protective to neuronal activity.",

As EVs may transfer between the brain and the blood, we have thus hypothesized that the total plasma EVs (pEVs) may contain potential markers to predict the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD progression. We have thus quantified AD-related proteins in isolated pEVs from controls, MCI and AD subjects. In pEVs, we observed early changes of total tau (tTau), amyloid precursor protein levels, and phospho-tau (pTau)-T181/tTau ratio from MCI subjects and late increases of Abeta42 and pTau-T181 levels from patients with moderate AD. Interestingly, abnormal amyloid precursor protein levels and pTau-T181/tTau ratio in pEVs demonstrated a high accuracy to define MCI and AD staging. Although larger samples sizes will be needed to generate well-powered investigations, these preliminary results highlighted the potential of AD-related proteins enriched in pEVs as a sensitive tool for differentiating patients with MCI to patients with AD and monitoring AD progression.",

    "abstract": "Traffic-related air pollution particulate matter (TRAP-PM) is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer Disease (AD). Rodent models respond to nano-sized TRAP-PM (nPM) with increased production of amyloid Abeta peptides, concurrently with oxidative damage. Because pro-Abeta processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) occurs on subcellular lipid rafts, we hypothesized that oxidative stress from nPM exposure would alter lipid rafts to favor Abeta production. This hypothesis was tested with J20 mice and N2a cells transgenic for hAPPswe (familial AD). Exposure of J20-APPswe mice to nPM for 150 h caused increased lipid oxidation (4-HNE) and increased the pro-amyloidogenic processing of APP in lipid raft fractions in cerebral cortex; the absence of these changes in cerebellum parallels the AD brain region selectivity for Abeta deposits. In vitro, nPM induced similar oxidative responses in N2a-APPswe cells, with dose-dependent production of NO, oxidative damage (4-HNE, 3NT), and lipid raft alterations of APP with increased Abeta peptides. The antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) attenuated nPM-induced oxidative damage and lipid raft alterations of APP processing. These findings identify neuronal lipid rafts as novel targets of oxidative damage in the pro-amyloidogenic effects of air pollution.",

Recent studies have shown that exosomes contain both amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau proteins and have a controversial role in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) process. In this study, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect the levels of P-S396-tau and Abeta1-42 in plasma exosomes. We found that levels of P-S396-tau and Abeta1-42 in plasma exosomes of AD patients were significantly higher compared to those in matched healthy controls. The difference between plasma exosomes of AD patients and those of matched healthy controls was determined using transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Exosomes from AD patients were smaller and lower in quantity. These data together may provide a basis for early diagnosis of AD.",

One of the most abundant FAD mutations, PSEN1 A431E, has been reported to be associated with spastic paraparesis in about half of its carriers, but the determining mechanisms of this phenotype are still unknown. In our study we characterized three A431E mutation carriers, one symptomatic and two asymptomatic, from a Mexican family with a history of spastic paraparesis in all of its affected members. At cognitive assessment and MRI, the symptomatic subject showed an atypical non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment with visuospatial deficits, olfactory dysfunction and significant parieto-occipital brain atrophy. Furthermore, we found several periventricular white matter hyperintensities whose progression pattern and localization correlated with their motor impairment, cognitive profile, and non-motor symptoms. Together, our data suggests that in this family the A431E mutation leads to a divergent neurological disorder in which cognitive deterioration was clinically exceeded by motor impairment and that it involves early glial and vascular pathological changes.",

Predicting Abeta positivity prior to PET imaging can decrease unnecessary patient burden and costs of running these trials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model in estimating the individual risk of Abeta+ based on gold-standard of PET imaging. METHODS: We used data from an amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) subset of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort to develop and validate the models. The predictors of Abeta status included demographic and ApoE4 status in all models plus a combination of neuropsychological tests (NP), MRI volumetrics, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. RESULTS: The models that included NP and MRI measures separately showed an area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC) of 0.74 and 0.72, respectively. However, using NP and MRI measures jointly in the model did not improve prediction. The models including CSF biomarkers significantly outperformed other models with AUCs between 0.89 to 0.92. CONCLUSIONS: Predictive models can be effectively used to identify persons with aMCI likely to be amyloid positive on a subsequent PET scan.",

One hundred and sixty-seven initially unimpaired individuals (baseline age 59 +- 6 years; 115 females) were stratified by elevated amyloid-beta and tau status based on 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) and 18F-MK-6240 PET imaging. Mixed effects models were used to determine if longitudinal cognitive trajectories based on a composite of cognitive tests including memory and executive function differed between biomarker groups. Secondary analyses investigated group differences for a variety of cross-sectional health and cognitive tests, and associations between 18F-MK-6240, 11C-PiB, and age. A significant group x age interaction was observed with post hoc comparisons indicating that the group with both elevated amyloid and tau pathophysiology were declining approximately three times faster in retrospective cognition compared to those with just one or no elevated biomarkers. This result was robust against various thresholds and medial temporal lobe regions defining elevated tau. Participants were relatively healthy and mostly did not differ between biomarker groups in health factors at the beginning or end of study, or most cognitive measures at study entry. Analyses investigating association between age, MK-6240 and PiB indicated weak associations between age and 18F-MK-6240 in tangle-associated regions, which were negligible after adjusting for 11C-PiB. Strong associations, particularly in entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, were observed between 18F-MK-6240 and global 11C-PiB in regions associated with Braak neurofibrillary tangle stages I-VI. These results suggest that the combination of pathological amyloid and tau is detrimental to cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease during late middle-age. Within the Alzheimer's disease continuum, middle-age health factors likely do not greatly influence preclinical cognitive decline. Future studies in a larger preclinical sample are needed to determine if and to what extent individual contributions of amyloid and tau affect cognitive decline. 18F-MK-6240 shows promise as a sensitive biomarker for detecting neurofibrillary tangles in preclinical Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Low plasma neurofilament light levels associated with raised cortical microglial activation suggest inflammation acts to protect prodromal Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of neurofilament light (NfL), a marker of axonal degeneration, have previously been reported to be raised in patients with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease (AD). Activated microglia, an intrinsic inflammatory response to brain lesions, are also known to be present in a majority of Alzheimer or mild cognitive impaired (MCI) subjects with raised beta-amyloid load on their positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. It is now considered that the earliest phase of inflammation may be protective to the brain, removing amyloid plaques and remodelling synapses. Our aim was to determine whether the cortical inflammation/microglial activation load, measured with the translocator protein marker 11C-PK11195 PET, was correlated with plasma NfL levels in prodromal and early Alzheimer subjects. METHODS: Twenty-seven MCI or early AD cases with raised cortical beta-amyloid load had 11C-(R)-PK11195 PET, structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, and levels of their plasma NfL measured. Correlation analyses were performed using surface-based cortical statistics. RESULTS: Statistical maps localised areas in MCI cases where levels of brain inflammation correlated inversely with plasma NfL levels. These areas were localised in the frontal, parietal, precuneus, occipital, and sensorimotor cortices. Brain inflammation correlated negatively with mean diffusivity (MD) of water with regions overlapping. CONCLUSION: We conclude that an inverse correlation between levels of inflammation in cortical areas and plasma NfL levels indicates that microglial activation may initially be protective to axons in AD. This is supported by the finding of an inverse association between cortical water diffusivity and microglial activation in the same regions. Our findings suggest a rationale for stimulating microglial activity in early and prodromal Alzheimer cases-possibly using immunotherapy. Plasma NfL levels could be used as a measure of the protective efficacy of immune stimulation and for monitoring efficacy of putative neuroprotective agents.",

    "abstract": "Age at symptom onset (AAO) underlies different Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical variants: late-onset AD (LOAD) is characterized by memory deficits, while early-onset AD (EOAD) presents predominantly with non-memory symptoms. The involvement of different neural networks may explain these distinct clinical phenotypes. In this study, we tested the hypothesis of an early and selective involvement of neural networks based on AAO in AD. Twenty memory clinic patients with prodromal AD (i.e., mild cognitive impairment with an AD-like cerebrospinal fluid profile) and 30 healthy controls underwent a cognitive evaluation and a resting state functional MRI exam. Independent component analysis was performed to assess functional connectivity (FC) in the following networks: default mode, frontoparietal, limbic, visual, and sensorimotor. Patients were stratified into late-onset (pLOAD) and early-onset (pEOAD) prodromal AD according to the AAO and controls were stratified into younger and older groups accordingly. Decreased FC within the default mode and the limbic networks was observed in pLOAD, while pEOAD showed lower FC in the frontoparietal and visual networks. The sensorimotor network did not show differences between groups. A significant association was found between memory and limbic network FC in pLOAD, and between executive functions and frontoparietal network FC in pEOAD, although the latter association did not survive multiple comparison correction. Our findings indicate that aberrant connectivity in memory networks is associated with pLOAD, while networks underlying executive and visuo-spatial functions are affected in pEOAD. These findings are in line with the hypothesis that the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying EOAD and LOAD are distinct.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of copper homeostasis is associated with a number of severe diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Wilson's disease, and Menkes syndrome. Given this association, the detection and capture of Cu2+ in biological fluids and tissues may provide a new direction for the diagnosis and treatment of related disorders. The current analytical approaches, however, are challenging due to the high cost, complexity, and long time required to prepare and analyze samples. Here, we report a novel salen ligand, namely N,N'-(1,2-phenylene)bis(1-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)methanimine) (pimi), which can readily detect and concurrently capture Cu2+ from aqueous as well as biological mediums. Pimi can selectively and specifically detect Cu2+ from biofluid and cellular samples with rapid ccresponse time (<3 s) and an ultra-sensitive detecting limit (2.7 nM). More importantly, pimi showed excellent environmental tolerance and had a very wide pH range for detecting Cu2+ in a variety of biological samples. Attributed to the strong binding affinity and selectivity towards Cu2+, pimi was found to capture Cu2+ ions from Cu-Abeta complexes, thus inhibiting copper-induced aggregation of Abeta and protecting neuronal cells from the toxicity of aggregated Abeta. These results provide a compelling starting point for further fine-tuning of salen-based chemosensor for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases associated with the hyperaccumulation of copper.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis occurs early in Alzheimer's disease (AD), associated with elevated circulating glucocorticoids (GC) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) signaling impairment. However, the precise role of GR in the pathophysiology of AD remains unclear. Using an acute model of AD induced by the intracerebroventricular injection of amyloid-beta oligomers (oAbeta), we analyzed cellular and behavioral hallmarks of AD, GR signaling pathways, processing of amyloid precursor protein, and enzymes involved in Tau phosphorylation. We focused on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly rich in GR, early altered in AD and involved in HPA axis control and cognitive functions. We found that oAbeta impaired cognitive and emotional behaviors, increased plasma GC levels, synaptic deficits, apoptosis and neuroinflammatory processes. Moreover, oAbeta potentiated the amyloidogenic pathway and enzymes involved both in Tau hyperphosphorylation and GR activation. Treatment with a selective GR modulator (sGRm) normalized plasma GC levels and all behavioral and biochemical parameters analyzed. GR seems to occupy a central position in the pathophysiology of AD. Deregulation of the HPA axis and a feed-forward effect on PFC GR sensitivity could participate in the etiology of AD, in perturbing Abeta and Tau homeostasis. These results also reinforce the therapeutic potential of sGRm in AD.",

    "title": "Spatial patterns of tau deposition are associated with amyloid, ApoE, sex, and cognitive decline in older adults.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: The abnormal deposition of tau begins before the onset of clinical symptoms and seems to target specific brain networks. The aim of this study is to identify the spatial patterns of tau deposition in cognitively normal older adults and assess whether they are related to amyloid-beta (Abeta), APOE, sex, and longitudinal cognitive decline. METHODS: We included 114 older adults with cross-sectional flortaucipir (FTP) and Pittsburgh Compound-B PET in addition to longitudinal cognitive testing. A voxel-wise independent component analysis was applied to FTP images to identify the spatial patterns of tau deposition. We then assessed whether tau within these patterns differed by Abeta status, APOE genotype, and sex. Linear mixed effects models were built to test whether tau in each component predicted cognitive decline. Finally, we ordered the spatial components based on the frequency of high tau deposition to model tau spread. RESULTS: We found 10 biologically plausible tau patterns in the whole sample. There was greater tau in medial temporal, occipital, and orbitofrontal components in Abeta-positive compared with Abeta-negative individuals; in the parahippocampal component in epsilon3epsilon3 compared with epsilon2epsilon3 carriers; and in temporo-parietal and anterior frontal components in women compared with men. Higher tau in temporal and frontal components predicted longitudinal cognitive decline in memory and executive functions, respectively. Tau deposition was most frequently observed in medial temporal and ventral cortical areas, followed by lateral and primary areas. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the spatial patterns of tau in asymptomatic individuals are clinically meaningful and are associated with Abeta, APOE epsilon2epsilon3, sex and cognitive decline. These patterns could be used to predict the regional spread of tau and perform in vivo tau staging in older adults.",

    "abstract": "The toxic conformer of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) ending at 42 (Abeta42), which contains a unique turn conformation at amino acid residue positions 22 and 23 and tends to form oligomers that are neurotoxic, was reported to play a critical role in the pathomechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which diabetes mellitus (DM)-like mechanisms are also suggested to be operative. It remains to be established whether the attenuation of insulin signaling is involved in an increase of toxic Abeta42 conformer levels. The present study investigated the association between impaired insulin metabolism and formation of toxic Abeta42 conformers in the brains of an AD mouse model. In particular, we studied whether insulin deficiency or resistance affected the formation of toxic Abeta42 conformers in vivo. We induced insulin deficiency and resistance in 3xTg-AD mice, a mouse AD model harboring two familial AD-mutant APP (KM670/671NL) and PS1 (M146 V) genes and a mutant TAU (P301L) gene, by streptozotocin (STZ) injection and a high fructose diet (HFuD), respectively. Cognitive impairment was significantly worsened by STZ injection but not by HFuD. Dot blot analysis revealed significant increases in total Abeta42 levels and the ratio of toxic Abeta42 conformer/total Abeta42 in STZ-treated mice compared with control and HFuD-fed mice. Immunostaining showed the accumulation of toxic Abeta42 conformers and hyper-phosphorylated tau protein (p-tau), which was more prominent in the cortical and hippocampal neurons of STZ-treated mice compared with HFuD-fed and control mice. HFuD-fed mice showed only a mild-to-moderate increase of these proteins compared with controls. Toxic Abeta42 conformers were co-localized with p-tau oligomers (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.62) in the hippocampus, indicating their co-aggregation. Toxic Abeta42 conformer levels were inversely correlated with pancreatic insulin secretion capacity as shown by fasting immunoreactive insulin levels in STZ-treated mice (correlation coefficient = -0.5879, p = .04441), but not HFuD-fed mice, suggesting a decrease in serum insulin levels correlates with toxic Abeta42 conformer formation. Levels of p-Akt and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3beta measured by a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assay were significantly lower in STZ-treated mice than in HFuD-fed mice, suggesting a greater inhibition of brain insulin signaling by STZ than HFuD, although both levels were significantly decreased in these groups compared with controls. Iba1-positive and NOS2-positive areas in the cortex and hippocampus were significantly increased in STZ-treated mice and to a lesser extent in HFuD-fed mice compared with controls. These findings suggest that insulin deficiency rather than insulin resistance and the resultant impairment of brain insulin signaling facilitates the formation of toxic Abeta42 conformer and its co-aggregation with p-tau oligomers, and that insulin deficiency is an important pathogenic factor in the progression of AD.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibition of beta-amyloid aggregation of ethyl acetate and ethanolic extracts obtained from Ugni molinae leaves on neurotoxic actions of beta-amyloid aggregates. Chemical analyses were carried out with the extracts in order to determine their phenolic profile and its quantification. Both extracts showed a tendency to reduce neuronal deaths caused by beta-amyloid. This tendency was inversely proportional to the evaluated concentrations. Moreover, the effect of EAE and ETE on beta-amyloid aggregation was studied by fluorimetric T Thioflavin assay and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM); the extracts showed a modulation in the aggregation process. Partly, it is believed that these effects can be attributed to the polyphenolic compounds present in the extracts.",

However, the interaction between these two pathologies and the mechanisms underlying disease progression have remained unclear. Numerous failed clinical trials suggest the necessity for greater mechanistic understanding in order to refine strategies for therapeutic discovery and development. To this end, we have generated a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model expressing both human Abeta1-42 peptide and human tau protein pan-neuronally. We observed exacerbated behavioral dysfunction and age-dependent neurodegenerative changes in the Abeta;tau transgenic animals. Further, these changes occurred in the Abeta;tau transgenic animals at greater levels than worms harboring either the Abeta1-42 or tau transgene alone and interestingly without changes to the levels of tau expression, phosphorylation or aggregation. Functional changes were partially rescued with the introduction of a genetic suppressor of tau pathology. Taken together, the data herein support a synergistic role for both Abeta and tau in driving neuronal dysfunction seen in AD. Additionally, we believe that the utilization of the genetically tractable C. elegans model will provide a key resource for dissecting mechanisms driving AD molecular pathology.",

Preclinical evidence suggests that tau spreads across connected neurons in an activity-dependent manner. Supporting this, cross-sectional AD studies show that tau deposition patterns resemble functional brain networks.

Here, we combine resting-state fMRI with longitudinal tau-PET in two independent samples including 53 (ADNI) and 41 (BioFINDER) amyloid-biomarker defined AD subjects and 28 (ADNI) vs. 16 (BioFINDER) amyloid-negative healthy controls. In both samples, AD subjects show faster tau accumulation than controls. Second, in AD, higher fMRI-assessed connectivity between 400 regions of interest (ROIs) is associated with correlated tau-PET accumulation in corresponding ROIs. Third, we show that a model including baseline connectivity and tau-PET is associated with future tau-PET accumulation.

Mature induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical neurons secrete Abeta peptides in ratios comparable to those secreted to cerebrospinal fluid in human, however the protocol to achieve mature neurons is time consuming. In this study, we investigated if differentiation of neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) in BrainPhys medium, previously reported to enhance synaptic function of neurons in culture, would accelerate neuronal maturation and, thus increase Abeta secretion as compared to the conventional neural maintenance medium. We found that NPCs cultured in BrainPhys displayed increased expression of markers for cortical deep-layer neurons, increased synaptic maturation and number of astroglial cells. This accelerated neuronal maturation was accompanied by increased APP processing, resulting in increased secretion of Abeta peptides and an increased Abeta38 to Abeta40 and Abeta42 ratio. However, during long-term culturing in BrainPhys, non-neuronal cells appeared and eventually took over the cultures. Taken together, BrainPhys culturing accelerated neuronal maturation and increased Abeta secretion from iPSC-derived cortical neurons, but changed the cellular composition of the cultures.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, and the accumulation of amyloid-beta is the initial process in AD. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are widely known as key regulators of the accumulation of amyloid-beta in AD. This study analyzed the potential effects and possible internal mechanisms of miR-340 on AD. METHODS: The expression of miR-340 in senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8) mouse and senescence-accelerated mice/resistant-1 (SAMR1) mouse was evaluated by qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction). The expression of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) was determined by qRT-PCR and western blot. The binding ability between miR-340 and BACE1 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. In vitro cell model of AD was established in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells transfected with Swedish mutant form of amyloid precursor protein (APPswe). The effect of miR-340 on the accumulation of amyloid- beta was investigated by western blot analysis. Flow cytometry was conducted to detect cell apoptosis. RESULTS: MiR-340 was down-regulated in the hippocampus of AD model SAMP8 mouse compared to SAMR1 mouse, while BACE1 was up-regulated in SAMP8, suggesting a negative correlation between miR-340 and BACE1 in SAMP8 mouse. MiR-340 could directly bind with BACE1, and over-expression of miR-340 decreased expression of BACE1 in SH-SY5Y/APPswe cells. MiR- 340 reduced the accumulation of amyloid-beta and suppressed cell apoptosis through targeting BACE1 in SH-SY5Y/APPswe cells. CONCLUSION: MiR-340 was downregulated in AD and reduced the accumulation of amyloid-beta through targeting BACE1, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for AD.",

Thus far, therapies targeting the enzymes responsible for Abeta production have been found ineffective or having significant side effects. OBJECTIVE: To test whether a gamma-secretase modulator, BPN-15606, is an effective disease-modifying or preventative treatment in the PSAPP mouse model of AD. METHODS: We treated pre-plaque (3-month-old) and post-plaque (6-month-old) PSAPP AD transgenic mice for 3 months and examined behavioral, biochemical, and pathological end points. RESULTS: BPN-15606 attenuated cognitive impairment and reduced amyloid plaque load, microgliosis, and astrogliosis associated with the AD phenotype of PSAPP mice when administered to pre-plaque (3-month-old) but was ineffective when administered to post-plaque (6-month-old) mice. No treatment-related toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION: BPN-15606 appears efficacious when administered prior to significant pathology.",

Deterioration of molecular chaperone systems upon ageing are thought to underlie age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and augmenting their activities could have therapeutic potential. The dementia relevant domain BRICHOS from the Bri2 protein shows qualitatively different chaperone activities depending on quaternary structure, and assembly of monomers into high-molecular weight oligomers reduces the ability to prevent neurotoxicity induced by the Alzheimer-associated amyloid-beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta42). Here we design a Bri2 BRICHOS mutant (R221E) that forms stable monomers and selectively blocks a main source of toxic species during Abeta42 aggregation. Wild type Bri2 BRICHOS oligomers are partly disassembled into monomers in the presence of the R221E mutant, which leads to potentiated ability to prevent Abeta42 toxicity to neuronal network activity. These results suggest that the activity of endogenous molecular chaperones may be modulated to enhance anti-Abeta42 neurotoxic effects.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) is an early event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The autophagy-lysosomal pathway is an important pathway for maintaining cellular proteostasis and for the removal of damaged organelles and protein aggregates in all eukaryotes. Despite mounting evidence showing that modulating autophagy promotes clearance of Abeta aggregates, the regulatory mechanisms and signalling pathways underlying this process remain poorly understood. In order to gain better insight we used our previously characterised yeast model expressing GFP-Abeta42 to identify genes that regulate the removal of Abeta42 aggregates by autophagy. We report that GFP-Abeta42 is sequestered and is selectively transported to vacuole for degradation and that autophagy is the prominent pathway for clearance of aggregates. Next, to identify genes that selectively promote the removal of Abeta42 aggregates, we screened levels of GFP-Abeta42 and non-aggregating GFP-Abeta42 (19:34) proteins in a panel of 192 autophagy mutants lacking genes involved in regulation and initiation of the pathway, cargo selection and degradation processes. The nutrient and stress signalling genes RRD1, SNF4, GCN4 and SSE1 were identified. Deletion of these genes impaired GFP-Abeta42 clearance and their overexpression reduced GFP-Abeta42 levels in yeast. Overall, our findings identify a novel role for these nutrient and stress signalling genes in the targeted elimination of Abeta42 aggregates, which offer a promising avenue for developing autophagy based therapies to suppress amyloid deposition in AD.",

    "title": "Better stress coping associated with lower tau in amyloid-positive cognitively unimpaired older adults.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Research in animals has shown that chronic stress exacerbates tau pathology. In humans, psychological stress has been associated with higher risk of Alzheimer disease clinical syndrome. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to assess the hypothesis that stress coping ability (assessed via the Brief Resilience Scale [BRS]) is associated with tau burden and to evaluate whether these associations differed by sex and amyloid status (A+/A-) in cognitively unimpaired (CU) older adults. METHODS: We included 225 CU participants (mean age 70.4 +- 10.2 years, 48% female) enrolled in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who completed the BRS and underwent amyloid-PET (Pittsburgh compound B-PET) and tau-PET (AV1451-PET). We fitted multiple regression and analysis of covariance models to assess the associations between BRS and tau-PET and the interaction with amyloid status and sex. We focused on entorhinal cortex (ERC) tau burden and also performed voxel-wise analyses. Age, sex, education, depression, and anxiety were considered as covariates. RESULTS: Higher stress coping ability was associated with lower tau burden in the medial temporal lobe (including ERC) and occipito-temporal and cuneal/precuneal cortices. The association was present in both A+ and A- but weaker in A- CU older adults. There was an interaction between amyloid status and stress coping ability that was restricted to the medial temporal lobe tau such that A+ CU older adults with lower stress coping abilities showed higher tau. There were no significant interactions between stress coping and sex. CONCLUSIONS: A faster termination of the stress response (higher coping ability) may limit the negative effects of stress on tau deposition. Conversely, lower stress coping ability may be an early sign of accumulating tau pathology. Longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify whether stress mechanisms act to exacerbate tau pathology or tau influences stress-related brain mechanisms and lowers the ability to cope with stress.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases has been hypothesized to depend on a metastable subproteome vulnerable to aggregation. To investigate this phenomenon and the mechanisms that regulate it, we measured the solubility of the proteome in the mouse Neuro2a cell line under six different protein homeostasis stresses: 1) Huntington's disease proteotoxicity, 2) Hsp70, 3) Hsp90, 4) proteasome, 5) endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mediated folding inhibition, and 6) oxidative stress. Overall, we found that about one-fifth of the proteome changed solubility with almost all of the increases in insolubility were counteracted by increases in solubility of other proteins. Each stress directed a highly specific pattern of change, which reflected the remodeling of protein complexes involved in adaptation to perturbation, most notably, stress granule (SG) proteins, which responded differently to different stresses. These results indicate that the protein homeostasis system is organized in a modular manner and aggregation patterns were not correlated with protein folding stability (DeltaG). Instead, distinct cellular mechanisms regulate assembly patterns of multiple classes of protein complexes under different stress conditions.",

    "abstract": "TREM2 is an Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk gene expressed in microglia. To study the role of Trem2 in a mouse model of beta-amyloidosis, we compared PS2APP transgenic mice versus PS2APP mice lacking Trem2 (PS2APP;Trem2ko) at ages ranging from 4 to 22 months. Microgliosis was impaired in PS2APP;Trem2ko mice, with Trem2-deficient microglia showing compromised expression of proliferation/Wnt-related genes and marked accumulation of ApoE. Plaque abundance was elevated in PS2APP;Trem2ko females at 6-7 months; but by 12 or 19-22 months of age, it was notably diminished in female and male PS2APP;Trem2ko mice, respectively. Across all ages, plaque morphology was more diffuse in PS2APP;Trem2ko brains, and the Abeta42:Abeta40 ratio was elevated. The amount of soluble, fibrillar Abeta oligomers also increased in PS2APP;Trem2ko hippocampi. Associated with these changes, axonal dystrophy was exacerbated from 6 to 7 months onward in PS2APP;Trem2ko mice, notwithstanding the reduced plaque load at later ages. PS2APP;Trem2ko mice also exhibited more dendritic spine loss around plaque and more neurofilament light chain in CSF. Thus, aggravated neuritic dystrophy is a more consistent outcome of Trem2 deficiency than amyloid plaque load, suggesting that the microglial packing of Abeta into dense plaque is an important neuroprotective activity.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Genetic studies indicate that TREM2 gene mutations confer increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. We studied the effects of Trem2 deletion in the PS2APP mouse AD model, in which overproduction of Abeta peptide leads to amyloid plaque formation and associated neuritic dystrophy. Interestingly, neuritic dystrophies were intensified in the brains of Trem2-deficient mice, despite these mice displaying reduced plaque accumulation at later ages (12-22 months). Microglial clustering around plaques was impaired, plaques were more diffuse, and the Abeta42:Abeta40 ratio and amount of soluble, fibrillar Abeta oligomers were elevated in Trem2-deficient brains. These results suggest that the Trem2-dependent compaction of Abeta into dense plaques is a protective microglial activity, limiting the exposure of neurons to toxic Abeta species.",

    "title": "Frontal variant of Alzheimer's disease with asymmetric presentation mimicking frontotemporal dementia: Case report and literature review.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Frontal variant of Alzheimer's disease (fvAD) is a rare nonamnestic syndrome of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Differentiating it from behavior variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), which has implications for treatment responses and prognosis, remains a clinical challenge. METHODS: Molecular neuroimaging and biofluid markers were performed for the index patient for accurate premortem diagnosis of fvAD. The clinical, neuroimaging, and biofluid characteristics of the patient were compared to those reported in previous studies of fvAD from 1999 to 2019. RESULTS: A 66-year-old man presented with progressive executive dysfunction, personality and behavioral changes, and memory decline since age 59. He had no family history of neurodegenerative disorders. A stimulus-sensitive myoclonus was noted over his left upper extremity. Neuropsychological assessment revealed moderate dementia with a Mini-Mental State Exam score of 10/30 and compromised executive and memory performance. Brain imaging showed asymmetrical atrophy and hypometabolism over the right frontal and temporal areas, mimicking bvFTD. However, we observed increased tau depositions based on 18 F-labeled T807 Tau PET in these areas and diffusely increased amyloid deposition based on 11 C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PET). Plasma biomarker measures indicated an AD profile with increased Abeta1-42 (18.66 pg/ml; cutoff: 16.42 pg/ml), Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratio (0.45; cutoff: 0.30), total tau (29.78 pg/ml; cutoff: 23.89 pg/ml), and phosphorylated tau (4.11 pg/ml; cutoff: 3.08 pg/ml). These results supported a diagnosis of fvAD. CONCLUSIONS: Our results with asymmetrical presentations extend current knowledge about this rare AD variant. Application of biofluid and molecular imaging markers could assist in early, accurate diagnosis.",

Here, we further investigated the mechanism by which cGMP regulates the subcellular localization of APP and BACE1, finding that the cyclic nucleotide inhibits the activity of Rab5, a small GTPase associated with the plasma membrane and early endosomes. Accordingly, we also found that expression of a dominant-negative Rab5 mutant increases both APP-BACE1 approximation and Abeta extracellular levels, therefore mimicking the effects induced by cGMP. These results reveal a functional correlation between the cGMP/Abeta pathway and the activity of Rab5 that may contribute to the understanding of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized neuropathologically by progressive neurodegeneration and by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. These plaques and tangles are composed, respectively, of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau proteins. While long recognized as hallmarks of AD, it remains unclear what causes the formation of these insoluble deposits. One theory holds that prion-like templated misfolding of Abeta and tau induces these proteins to form pathological aggregates, and propagation of this misfolding causes the stereotyped progression of pathology commonly seen in AD. Supporting this theory, numerous studies have been conducted in which aggregated Abeta, tau, or alpha-synuclein is injected intracerebrally into pathology-free host animals, resulting in robust formation of pathology. Here, we review this literature, focusing on in vivo intracerebral seeding of Abeta and tau in mice. We compare the results of these experiments to what is known about the seeding and spread of alpha-synuclein pathology, and we discuss how this research informs our understanding of the factors underlying the onset, progression, and outcomes of proteinaceous pathologies.",

    "abstract": "The formation of amyloid fibrils from soluble peptide is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Characterization of the microscopic reaction processes that underlie these phenomena have yielded insights into the progression of such diseases and may inform rational approaches for the design of drugs to halt them. Experimental evidence suggests that most of these reaction processes are intrinsically catalytic in nature and may display enzymelike saturation effects under conditions typical of biological systems, yet a unified modeling framework accounting for these saturation effects is still lacking. In this paper, we therefore present a universal kinetic model for biofilament formation in which every fundamental process in the reaction network can be catalytic. The single closed-form expression derived is capable of describing with high accuracy a wide range of mechanisms of biofilament formation and providing the first integrated rate law of a system in which multiple reaction processes are saturated. Moreover, its unprecedented mathematical simplicity permits us to very clearly interpret the effects of increasing saturation on the overall kinetics. The effectiveness of the model is illustrated by fitting it to the data of in vitro Abeta40 aggregation. Remarkably, we find that primary nucleation becomes saturated, demonstrating that it must be heterogeneous, occurring at interfaces and not in solution.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia (EPAD) Programme is a pan-European project whose objective is to deliver a platform, adaptive, Phase 2 proof of concept (PoC) trial for the secondary prevention of Alzheimer's dementia. A component of this platform is the Longitudinal Cohort Study (LCS) which acts as a readiness cohort for the PoC Trial as well as generating data for disease modelling work in the preclinical and prodromal phases of Alzheimer's dementia. OBJECTIVES: The first data wave has been collected, quality checked, released and now available for analysis to answer numerous research questions. Here we describe the results from key variables in the EPAD LCS with the objective of using these results to compliment analyses of these data in the future. DESIGN: EPAD LCS is a cohort study whose primary objective is as a readiness cohort for the EPAD PoC Trial. As such recruitment is not capped at any particular number but will continue to facilitate delivery of the EPAD PoC Trial. Research Participants are seen annually (with an additional 6 month visit in the first year). SETTING: The EPAD Trial Delivery Network comprises currently 21 centres across Europe. PARTICIPANTS: Research participants are included if they are over 50 years old and do not have a diagnosis of dementia. MEASUREMENTS: All research participants undergo multiple assessments to fully characterise the biology of Alzheimer's disease and relate this to risk factors (both fixed and modifiable) and biomarker expression of disease through brain imaging, fluid samples (CSF, blood, urine and saliva), cognitive performance, functional abilities and neuropsychiatric symptomatology. RESULTS: V500.0 represents the first 500 research participants baselined into EPAD LCS. The mean age was 66.4 (SD=6.7) and 47.8% were male. The data was split for presentation into 4 groups: [1] CDR=0 and Amyloid + (preclinical AD), [2] CDR=0 and Amyloid -, [3] CDR=0.5 and Amyloid + (prodromal AD) and [4] CDR=0.5 and Amyloid -. CONCLUSIONS: The EPAD LCS is achieving its primary objective of trial readiness and the structured approach to data release as manifest by this first data release of V500.0 will assist researchers to describe and compare their findings as well as in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. It is anticipated given current recruitment rates that V1500.0 data release will take place in Autumn 2019. V500.1 (when the 1 year follow up is completed on the V500.0 (sub)cohort will be in Autumn 2019 also.",

    "title": "Amyloid-Beta Peptides Trigger Aggregation of Alpha-Synuclein In Vitro.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), account for the majority of dementia cases worldwide. Interestingly, a significant number of patients have clinical and neuropathological features of both AD and PD, i.e., the presence of amyloid deposits and Lewy bodies in the neocortex. The identification of alpha-synuclein peptides in amyloid plaques in DLB brain led to the hypothesis that both peptides mutually interact with each other to facilitate neurodegeneration. In this article, we report the influence of Abeta(1-42) and pGlu-Abeta(3-42) on the aggregation of alpha-synuclein in vitro. The aggregation of human recombinant alpha-synuclein was investigated using thioflavin-T fluorescence assay. Fibrils were investigated by means of antibody conjugated immunogold followed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Our data demonstrate a significantly increased aggregation propensity of alpha-synuclein in the presence of minor concentrations of Abeta(1-42) and pGlu-Abeta(3-42) for the first time, but without effect on toxicity on mouse primary neurons. The analysis of the composition of the fibrils by TEM combined with immunogold labeling of the peptides revealed an interaction of alpha-synuclein and Abeta in vitro, leading to an accelerated fibril formation. The analysis of kinetic data suggests that significantly enhanced nucleus formation accounts for this effect. Additionally, co-occurrence of alpha-synuclein and Abeta and pGlu-Abeta, respectively, under pathological conditions was confirmed in vivo by double immunofluorescent labelings in brains of aged transgenic mice with amyloid pathology. These observations imply a cross-talk of the amyloid peptides alpha-synuclein and Abeta species in neurodegeneration. Such effects might be responsible for the co-occurrence of Lewy bodies and plaques in many dementia cases.",

Here we used specifically-designed optical reporter probes and live fluorescence imaging in primary hippocampal neurons to characterise the mechanism by which prefibrillar, oligomeric forms of the Alzheimer's-associated peptide, Abeta42, exert their detrimental effects. We used a pH-sensitive reporter, Abeta42-CypHer, to track Abeta internalisation in real-time, demonstrating that oligomers are rapidly taken up into cells in a dynamin-dependent manner, and trafficked via the endo-lysosomal pathway resulting in accumulation in lysosomes. In contrast, a non-assembling variant of Abeta42 (vAbeta42) assayed in the same way is not internalised. Tracking ovalbumin uptake into cells using CypHer or Alexa Fluor tags shows that preincubation with Abeta42 disrupts protein uptake. Our results identify a potential mechanism by which amyloidogenic aggregates impair cellular function through disruption of the endosomal-lysosomal pathway.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that is growing in prevalence globally. It is the only major cause of death without any effective pharmacological means to treat or slow progression. Inheritance of the epsilon4 allele of the Apolipoprotein (APO) E gene is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. The interaction between APOE and amyloid beta (Abeta) plays a key role in AD pathogenesis. The APOE-Abeta interaction regulates Abeta aggregation and clearance and therefore directly influences the development of amyloid plaques, congophilic amyloid angiopathy and subsequent tau related pathology. Relatively few AD therapeutic approaches have directly targeted the APOE-Abeta interaction thus far. Here we review the critical role of APOE in the pathogenesis of AD and some of the most promising therapeutic approaches that focus on the APOE-Abeta interaction.",

    "abstract": "Pathological beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced microglial activation could cause chronic neuroinflammation in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and has been considered as one of the main pathological events of this disease. Chicago sky blue 6B (CSB6B), a pigment used in biochemical staining, has been reported to produce analgesic effects in neuroinflammatory-associated pain models. We have previously found that CSB6B could directly inhibit Abeta aggregation and prevent Abeta toxicity in neurons. However, it remains unclear whether this compound could prevent Abeta-induced neuroinflammation and impairments of learning and memory in the AD models. In this study, CSB6B was found to effectively inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta, without affecting cell viability in BV2 microglia cells stimulated by Abeta oligomer and lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, CSB6B significantly reduced mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and increased mRNA expression of arginase-1, suggesting that CSB6B might promote the polarization of BV2 cells into M2 phenotype. In Abeta oligomer-treated mice, hippocampal injection of CSB6B prevented cognitive impairments, and attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokines production. In addition, CSB6B inhibited nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and restrainedthe activation of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing-3 (NLRP3) both in vitro and in vivo. According to our results, CSB6B may counteract Abeta-induced cognitive impairments and neuroinflammation by inhibiting NF-kappaB and NLRP3. Combined with previous studies, we anticipated that CSB6B may further develop into a potential anti-AD drug with multiple functions on neurons and microglia cells, concurrently.",

Although age, APOEepsilon4, and sex influence cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker levels, none of these variables are considered by current normality/abnormality cutoffs. Using baseline CSF data from 2 independent cohorts (PharmaCOG/European Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative), we investigated the effect of age, APOEepsilon4 status, and sex on CSF Abeta42/P-tau distribution and cutoff extraction by applying mixture models with covariates. The Abeta42/P-tau distribution revealed the presence of 3 subgroups (AD-like, intermediate, control-like) and 2 cutoffs. The identification of the intermediate subgroup and of the higher cutoff was APOEepsilon4 dependent in both cohorts. APOE-specific classification (higher cutoff for APOEepsilon4+, lower cutoff for APOEepsilon4-) showed higher diagnostic accuracy in identifying MCI due to AD compared to single Abeta42 and Abeta42/P-tau cutoffs.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Immunotherapeutic intervention is one of the most promising strategies for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although they showed great success in AD mouse models, the clinical trials of many immune approaches failed due to low efficacy and safety. Thus, an animal model which can show the potential side effects of vaccines or antibodies is urgently needed. In this study, we generated EAE/AD mice by crossing APP/PS1 mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice. We then investigated the efficacy and safety of two vaccines: the immunogens of which were Abeta1-42 aggregates (Abeta42 vaccine) and an oligomer-specific conformational epitope (AOE1 vaccine), respectively. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: EAE/AD mice were immunized with the Abeta42 vaccine or AOE1 vaccine five times at biweekly intervals. After the final immunization, cognitive function was evaluated by the Morris water maze, Y maze, and object recognition tests. Neuropathological changes in the mouse brains were analysed by immunohistochemistry and ELISA. KEY RESULTS: In contrast to previous findings in conventional AD animal models, Abeta42 immunization promoted neuroinflammation, enhanced Abeta levels and plaque burden, and failed to restore cognitive deficits in EAE/AD mice. By contrast, AOE1 immunization dramatically attenuated neuroinflammation, reduced Abeta levels, and improved cognitive performance in EAE/AD mice. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These results suggest that the EAE/AD mouse model can exhibit the potential side effects of AD immune approaches that conventional AD animal models fail to display. Furthermore, strategies specifically targeting Abeta oligomers may be safe and show clinical benefit for AD treatment.",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed tocharacterize longitudinal Abeta accumulation anddetermine the influence of age, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, disease duration, and sexin atypical AD and FTLD. METHODS: 322 patients (138 atypical AD, 184 FTLD) underwent Pittsburgh compound B PET scanning, with 73 having serialPiB-PET scans (42 atypical AD, 31 FTLD). Global Abeta standard uptake value ratios were calculated for every scan. Mixed effects models were used to assess the effect of age, APOE genotype, disease duration, and sex on baseline and change measures of Abeta. RESULTS: Atypical AD showed higher baseline Abeta than FTLD. Rate of Abeta accumulation was not associated with baseline Abeta in either group. Older age was associated with greater baseline Abeta and faster rates of accumulation in FTLD. In patients under age 70, atypical AD showed faster rates of accumulation than FTLD. APOEe4 genotype was associated with greater baseline Abeta in FTLD but did not influence rates of accumulation. Rates of Abeta accumulation were faster in FTLD patents with time from onset-to-PET<=4 years. Female sex was associated with faster rates of accumulation in atypical AD. CONCLUSION: Accumulation of Abeta is observed in atypical AD and FTLD, although different demographic factors influence accumulation in these diseases providing insight into potentially different biological mechanisms of Abeta deposition.",

    "title": "Alcohol Consumption, Brain Amyloid-beta Deposition, and Brain Structural Integrity Among Older Adults Free of Dementia.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Light to moderate alcohol consumption has been variably associated with lower or higher risk of dementia, but effects on Alzheimer's disease pathology are less clear. OBJECTIVE: We determined whether late-life alcohol consumption was associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology among older adults. METHODS: We assessed the associations of alcohol consumption self-reported in 2000-2002 with brain amyloid-beta deposition on PET scans, and white matter lesion and hippocampal volume on MRIs measured 7-9 years later in 189 participants of the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study (age 75-87 years at baseline) who were free of clinical dementia, using multivariable-adjusted and inverse probability-weighted robust linear regression models. RESULTS: Alcohol consumption was not statistically significantly associated with amyloid-beta deposition (standardized uptake value ratio difference per drink: -0.013 [95% CI: -0.027, 0.002]). Both non-drinkers and participants consuming >=1 drink(s)/week had higher white matter lesion volume (% intracranial volume) than did the reference group of those consuming <1 drink/week (differences: 0.25 % [95% CI: 0.01, 0.50]; 0.26 % [95% CI: 0.02, 0.50]). The association of alcohol consumption and hippocampal volume was modified by age (p = 0.02). Among participants younger than 77 years, participants consuming 1-7 drinks/week had larger hippocampal volume compared with participants consuming <1 drink/week. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol consumption was not statistically significantly associated with amyloid-beta deposition 7-9 years later. Non-drinking and greater alcohol consumption were associated with higher white matter lesion volume compared with drinking <1 drink/week. Moderate drinking was associated with higher hippocampal volume in younger individuals. Given the selective nature of this population and adverse health effects of excessive alcohol consumption, these findings warrant further investigation, but cannot be translated into clinical recommendations.",

    "abstract": "The self-assembly of the 42-residue amyloid-beta peptide, Abeta42, into fibrillar aggregates is associated with neuronal dysfunction and toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patient brains, suggesting that small molecules acting on this process might interfere with pathogenesis. Here, we present experimental evidence that the small molecule sclerotiorin (SCL), a natural product belonging to the group of azaphilones, potently delays both seeded and nonseeded Abeta42 polymerization in cell-free assays. Mechanistic biochemical studies revealed that the inhibitory effect of SCL on fibrillogenesis is caused by its ability to kinetically stabilize small Abeta42 oligomers. These structures exhibit low beta-sheet content and do not possess seeding activity, indicating that SCL acts very early in the amyloid formation cascade before the assembly of seeding-competent, beta-sheet-rich fibrillar aggregates. Investigations with NMR WaterLOGSY experiments confirmed the association of Abeta42 assemblies with SCL in solution. Furthermore, using ion mobility-mass spectrometry, we observed that SCL directly interacts with a small fraction of Abeta42 monomers in the gas phase. In comparison to typical amyloid fibrils, small SCL-stabilized Abeta42 assemblies are inefficiently taken up into mammalian cells and have low toxicity in cell-based assays. Overall, these mechanistic studies support a pathological role of stable, beta-sheet-rich Abeta42 fibrils in AD, while structures with low beta-sheet content may be less relevant.",

    "abstract": "Hyperphosphorylated tau is one of the key characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and tau pathology correlates with cognitive impairment in AD better than amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology. Thus, a complete understanding of the relevant factors involved in tau phosphorylation is important for AD treatment. APOEe4, the strongest genetic risk factor for AD, was found to be involved in tau pathology in frontotemporal dementia. This result indicated that apolipoprotein E (ApoE) may also participate in tau phosphorylation in AD. In the present study, we injected Abeta oligomer (AbetaO) into the lateral ventricles of wild-type (WT) mice and apoE-/- mice to test the process of tau phosphorylation in the acute phase. We found that the phosphorylated tau and phosphokinase levels were higher in WT mice than in apoE-/- mice. These phenomena were also confirmed in vitro. ApoE e4-treated apoE-/- neurons exhibited more phosphorylated tau than ApoE e2- and ApoE e3-treated neurons. We also found that AbetaO induced more serious inflammation in WT mice and in ApoE-positive cultured neurons. Anti-inflammatory treatment reduced the phosphorylated tau level induced by AbetaOs in ApoE-positive neurons. These results suggest that ApoE may facilitate the phosphorylation of tau induced by AbetaO via inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with synaptic dysfunction, pathological accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide 1-42 (Abeta1-42 ), and neuronal loss. The self-association of Abeta1-42 monomers (Abeta-M) into soluble oligomers seems to be crucial for the development of neurotoxicity. Previous publications have shown that Abeta oligomers and dimers might play key roles in inducing AD. The role of Abeta-M was rarely investigated and still unclear in AD. To understand the effects of Abeta-M on neurons and other cell types in the brain could be the key to understand its function. In our study, we found that Abeta-M expression slowly induced cell apoptosis within 48 hours after transfection, beta2 adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) interacted with Abeta-M in the pull-down and the yeast two-hybrid assays, and Abeta-M played a major role in inducing phosphorylation of Tau at Ser-214, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) at Thr-183/Tyr-185, p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) at Thr-389. We also discovered that beta2AR, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), and protein kinase A (PKA) mediated the phosphorylation of Tau and JNK. Abeta-M induced phosphorylation of Tau at Ser-214 through both beta2AR-cAMP/PKA-JNK and beta2AR-GRK signaling pathways. Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) mediated the phosphorylation of p70S6K induced by Abeta-M.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate whether the polygenic profile modifies the development of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) and pathological biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 462 sAD patients and 463 age-matched cognitively normal (CN) controls were genotyped for 35 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly associated with sAD. Then, the alleles found to be associated with sAD were used to build polygenic risk score (PRS) models to represent the genetic risk. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses and the Cox proportional hazards model were used to evaluate the predictive value of PRS for the sAD risk and age at onset. We measured the CSF levels of Abeta42, Abeta42/Abeta40, total tau (T-tau), and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) in a subgroup (60 sAD and 200 CN participants), and analyzed their relationships with the PRSs. We found that 14 SNPs, including SNPs in the APOE, BIN1, CD33, EPHA1, SORL1, and TOMM40 genes, were associated with sAD risk in our cohort. The PRS models built with these SNPs showed potential for discriminating sAD patients from CN controls, and were able to predict the incidence rate of sAD and age at onset. Furthermore, the PRSs were correlated with the CSF levels of Abeta42, Abeta42/Abeta40, T-tau, and P-tau. Our study suggests that PRS models hold promise for assessing the genetic risk and development of AD.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the association between striatal dopaminergic depletion, cerebral beta-amyloid deposition, and cognitive dysfunction in Lewy body disease (LBD). METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 48 LBD patients (30 with dementia, 18 with mild cognitive impairment) and 15 control subjects from a university-based hospital. We measured the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) activity and regional beta-amyloid burden using N-(3-[18 F]fluoropropyl)-2beta-carbon ethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane (FP-CIT) positron emission tomography (PET) and 18 F-florbetaben (FBB) PET, respectively. The relationship between striatal FP-CIT uptake, regional cortical FBB uptake, and cognitive function scores was evaluated using path analyses. We also investigated the effects of striatal FP-CIT uptake and cortical FBB uptake on the interval between motor symptom and dementia onset. RESULTS: Reduced striatal FP-CIT uptake was associated with increased FBB uptake in the posterior cortical regions, most prominently in the occipital cortices. Reduced FP-CIT uptake in the anterior putamen was associated with visuospatial dysfunction with mediation of increased occipital FBB uptake. Reduced FP-CIT uptake in the posterior putamen and an increased parietal FBB uptake were independently associated with memory dysfunction. Reduced striatal FP-CIT uptake was associated with attention, language, and frontal/executive dysfunction, independent of amyloid deposition. Increased FBB uptake, especially in the parietal cortex, was associated with earlier onset of dementia. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that occipital beta-amyloid deposition may contribute to the association between striatal dopaminergic depletion and visuospatial dysfunction in LBD patients. Although the effects of reduced DAT activity are more prominent than those of beta-amyloid burden on cognitive dysfunction, the latter affects the onset of cognitive dysfunction.

Critical to the process of neuroinflammation are the type-I interferon (IFN) family of cytokines. Efforts to phenotypically characterize microglia within AD identify distinct populations associated with type-I IFN signalling, yet how this affects underlying microglial function is yet to be fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate that Abeta1-42 exposure increases bioactive levels of type-I IFN produced by primary microglia alongside increased expression of type-I IFN related genes. Primary microglia isolated from brains of APPswePS1DeltaE9 mice with ablated type-I IFN signalling show an increased phagocytic ability to uptake FITC-Abeta1-42. Correlative assessment of plaque sizes in aged APPswePS1DeltaE9 mice with abrogated type-I IFN signalling show unchanged deposition levels. Microglia from these mice did however show alterations in morphology. This data further highlights the role of type-I IFN signalling within microglia and identifies a role in phagocytosis. As such, targeting both microglial and global type-I IFN signalling presents as a novel therapeutic strategy for AD management.",

Additionally, common and rare variants occur within APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 that may be risk factors, protective factors, or benign, non-pathogenic polymorphisms. Yet, to date, no single study has carefully examined the effect of all of the variants of unknown significance reported in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 on Abeta isoform levels in vitro. In this study, we analyzed Abeta isoform levels by ELISA in a cell-based system in which each reported pathogenic and risk variant in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 was expressed individually. In order to classify variants for which limited family history data is available, we have implemented an algorithm for determining pathogenicity using available information from multiple domains, including genetic, bioinformatic, and in vitro analyses. We identified 90 variants of unknown significance and classified 19 as likely pathogenic mutations. We also propose that five variants are possibly protective. In defining a subset of these variants as pathogenic, individuals from these families may eligible to enroll in observational studies and clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is believed to begin with synaptic dysfunction caused by soluble Abeta oligomers. When this oligomer hypothesis was proposed in 2002, there was no direct evidence that Abeta oligomers actually disrupt synaptic function to cause cognitive impairment in humans. In patient brains, both soluble and insoluble Abeta species always coexist, and therefore it is difficult to determine which pathologies are caused by Abeta oligomers and which are caused by amyloid fibrils. Thus, no validity of the oligomer hypothesis was available until the Osaka mutation was discovered. This mutation, which was found in a Japanese pedigree of familial Alzheimer's disease, is the deletion of codon 693 of APP gene, resulting in mutant Abeta lacking the 22nd glutamate. Only homozygous carriers suffer from dementia. In vitro studies revealed that this mutation has a very unique character that accelerates Abeta oligomerization but does not form amyloid fibrils. Model mice expressing this mutation demonstrated that all pathologies of Alzheimer's disease can be induced by Abeta oligomers alone. In this review, we describe the story behind the discovery of the Osaka mutation, summarize the mutant's phenotypes, and propose a mechanism of its recessive inheritance.",

Here we demonstrate a robust high-content imaging method for the assessment of synaptic changes and apply the method to brain homogenates from an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. Our method uses serial imaging of endogenous fluorescent labeled presynaptic VAMP2 and postsynaptic PSD95 in long-term cultured live primary neurons in 96 well microplates, and uses automatic image analysis to quantify the number of colocalized mature synaptic puncta for the assessment of synaptic changes in live neurons. As a control, we demonstrated that our synaptic puncta assay is at least 10-fold more sensitive to the toxic effects of glutamate than the MTT assay. Using our assay, we have compared synaptotoxic activities in size-exclusion chromatography fractioned protein samples from 3xTg-AD mouse model brain homogenates. Multiple synaptotoxic activities were found in high and low molecular weight fractions. Amyloid-beta immunodepletion alleviated some but not all of the synaptotoxic activities. Although the biochemical entities responsible for the synaptotoxic activities have yet to be determined, these proof-of-concept results demonstrate that this novel assay may have many potential mechanistic and therapeutic applications.",

Important breakthroughs have recently been made in elucidating the mechanism(s) of these mutations, showing that altered substrate interactions and substrate-enzyme complex stabilities are underlying their pathogenic Abeta generation. Moreover, first structures of gamma-secretase in complex with APP and Notch1 substrates allow insight into how substrate cleavage could be initiated and further progress has been made in the mechanistic understanding of gamma-secretase modulators, advanced Abeta-lowering drugs.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disease involved oxidative stress and inflammation in its pathogenesis. Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA) is an active triterpenoid compound from extracts of Boswellia serrata, which has been widely used as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. The present study was to determine whether AKBA, a novel candidate, could protect against cognitive and neuropathological impairments in AD. We found that AKBA treatment resulted in a significant improvement of learning and memory deficits, a dramatic decrease in cerebral amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels and plaque burden, a profound alleviation in oxidative stress and inflammation, and a marked reduction in activated glial cells and synaptic defects in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Furthermore, amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing was remarkably suppressed with AKBA treatment by inhibiting beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) protein expression to produce Abeta in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice brains. Mechanistically, AKBA modulated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways via increasing nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression, and via declining phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B alpha (IkappaBalpha) and p65. Collectively, our findings provide evidence that AKBA protects neurons against oxidative stress and inflammation in AD, and this neuroprotective effect involves the Nrf2/HO-1 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathways.",

    "title": "The clinical promise of biomarkers of synapse damage or loss in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Synapse damage and loss are fundamental to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and lead to reduced cognitive function. The goal of this review is to address the challenges of forging new clinical development approaches for AD therapeutics that can demonstrate reduction of synapse damage or loss. The key points of this review include the following: Synapse loss is a downstream effect of amyloidosis, tauopathy, inflammation, and other mechanisms occurring in AD.Synapse loss correlates most strongly with cognitive decline in AD because synaptic function underlies cognitive performance.Compounds that halt or reduce synapse damage or loss have a strong rationale as treatments of AD.Biomarkers that measure synapse degeneration or loss in patients will facilitate clinical development of such drugs.The ability of methods to sensitively measure synapse density in the brain of a living patient through synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, concentrations of synaptic proteins (e.g., neurogranin or synaptotagmin) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or functional imaging techniques such as quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) provides a compelling case to use these types of measurements as biomarkers that quantify synapse damage or loss in clinical trials in AD. CONCLUSION: A number of emerging biomarkers are able to measure synapse injury and loss in the brain and may correlate with cognitive function in AD. These biomarkers hold promise both for use in diagnostics and in the measurement of therapeutic successes.",

We studied plasma P-tau181 in three cohorts, with a total of 589 individuals, including cognitively unimpaired participants and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD dementia and non-AD neurodegenerative diseases. Plasma P-tau181 was increased in preclinical AD and further increased at the MCI and dementia stages. It correlated with CSF P-tau181 and predicted positive Tau positron emission tomography (PET) scans (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.87-0.91 for different brain regions). Plasma P-tau181 differentiated AD dementia from non-AD neurodegenerative diseases with an accuracy similar to that of Tau PET and CSF P-tau181 (AUC = 0.94-0.98), and detected AD neuropathology in an autopsy-confirmed cohort. High plasma P-tau181 was associated with subsequent development of AD dementia in cognitively unimpaired and MCI subjects. In conclusion, plasma P-tau181 is a noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of AD, which may be useful in clinical practice and trials.",

    "abstract": "Whether blood amyloid-beta (Abeta) could be a peripheral biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains in dispute. In the present study, we conducted a meta-analysis with 19 citations searched from Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library database. Weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was used to estimate the effect size. We firstly analyzed the plasma Abeta40, Abeta42, and Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio in AD and control group subjects. However, only a lower level of plasma Abeta42 was figured out in AD group subjects with weak statistical significance (WMD 1.82; 95% CI 0.59, 3.06; P = 0.004; I2 = 84%). We considered that the medical histories of control subjects could influence the biomarker ability of plasma Abeta. Therefore, subgroup analyses were then carried out based on a new recruiting criterion for control subjects, defining as no afflictions of any Abeta-related diseases. Surprisingly, AD group subjects showed a significant decrease in plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio with low heterogeneity among studies (WMD 0.02; 95% CI 0.02, 0.02; P < 0.00001; I2 = 0%). Moreover, not only the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio but also Abeta42 and Abeta40 were indifferent between AD and pseudo-control subjects which might be afflicted with Abeta-related diseases. This meta-analysis demonstrated that medical histories of control subjects were interference factors impeding plasma Abeta to be a biomarker of AD.",

    "title": "Neuroanatomical spread of amyloid beta and tau in Alzheimer's disease: implications for primary prevention.",
    "abstract": "With recent advances in our understanding of the continuous pathophysiological changes that begin many years prior to symptom onset, it is now apparent that Alzheimer's disease cannot be adequately described by discrete clinical stages, but should also incorporate the continuum of biological changes that precede and underlie the clinical representation of the disease. By jointly considering longitudinal changes of all available biomarkers and clinical assessments, variation within individuals can be integrated into a single continuous measure of disease progression and used to identify the earliest pathophysiological changes. Disease time, a measure of disease severity, was estimated using a Bayesian latent time joint mixed-effects model applied to an array of imaging, biomarker and neuropsychological data. Trajectories of regional amyloid beta and tau PET uptake were estimated as a function of disease time. Regions with early signs of elevated amyloid beta uptake were used to form an early, focal composite and compared to a commonly used global composite, in a separate validation sample. Disease time was estimated in 279 participants (183 cognitively unimpaired individuals, 61 mild cognitive impairment and 35 Alzheimer's disease dementia patients) with available amyloid beta and tau PET data. Amyloid beta PET uptake levels in the posterior cingulate and precuneus start high and immediately increase with small increases of disease time. Early elevation in tau PET uptake was found in the inferior temporal lobe, amygdala, banks of the superior temporal sulcus, entorhinal cortex, middle temporal lobe, inferior parietal lobe and the fusiform gyrus. In a separate validation sample of 188 cognitively unimpaired individuals, the early, focal amyloid beta PET composite showed a 120% increase in the accumulation rate of amyloid beta compared to the global composite (P < 0.001), resulting in a 60% increase in the power to detect a treatment effect in a primary prevention trial design. Ordering participants on a continuous disease time scale facilitates the inspection of the earliest signs of amyloid beta and tau pathology. To detect early changes in amyloid beta pathology, focusing on the earliest sites of amyloid beta accumulation results in more powerful and efficient study designs in early Alzheimer's disease. Targeted composites could be used to re-examine the thresholds for amyloid beta-related study inclusion, especially as the field shifts to focus on primary and secondary prevention. Clinical trials of anti-amyloid beta treatments may benefit from the use of focal composites when estimating drug effects on amyloid beta and tau changes in populations with minimal amyloid beta and tau pathology and limited expected short-term accumulation.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In the past few years, the beta-amyloid 42 peptide and tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have become primary diagnostic biomarkers in differentiating Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive normal controls. As we know, several neurodegenerative diseases have been reported to overlap with AD in neuropathology and clinical symptoms. To examine the discriminative utility of these biomarkers in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, we measured them in a cohort of Chinese population. METHODS: We measured CSF Abeta42, t-tau and p-tau181 by ELISA tests and calculated the ratios of t-tau/Abeta42 and p-tau181/Abeta42 in 240 Chinese Han patients with AD (n = 82), frontotemporal dementia (FTD, n = 20), Huntington's disease (HD, n = 27), multiple system atrophy (MSA, n = 24), spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 (SCA3, n = 27), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, n = 36) and controls (n = 24). RESULTS: As expected, all biomarkers showed high discriminative capacity between AD and non-AD groups (p < .05) except for the elevated CSF t-tau in FTD (p > .05). Comparing with the controls, tau related biomarkers significantly elevated in the FTD (p < .001) and MSA (p < .05) groups. Surprisingly, comparing with controls, we found that CSF Abeta42 increased remarkably in the SCA3 (p < .05), HD and ALS groups (p < .001), achieving a high specificity, respectively. CONCLUSION: To our best knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study in the Han Chinese population that confirmed the discriminative utility of CSF Abeta42 and tau biomarkers between AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Chronic inflammation during Alzheimer's disease (AD) is most often attributed to sustained microglial activation in response to amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaque deposits and cell death. However, cytokine release and microgliosis are consistently observed in AD transgenic animal models devoid of such pathologies, bringing into question the underlying processes that may be at play during the earliest AD-related immune response. We propose that this plaque-independent inflammatory reaction originates from neurons burdened with increasing levels of soluble and oligomeric Abeta, which are known to be the most toxic amyloid species within the brain. Laser microdissected neurons extracted from preplaque amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic rats were found to produce a variety of potent immune factors, both at the transcript and protein levels. Neuron-derived cytokines correlated with the extent of microglial activation and mobilization, even in the absence of extracellular plaques and cell death. Importantly, we identified an inflammatory profile unique to Abeta-burdened neurons, since neighboring glial cells did not express similar molecules. Moreover, we demonstrate within disease-vulnerable regions of the human brain that a neuron-specific inflammatory response may precede insoluble Abeta plaque and tau tangle formation. Thus, we reveal the Abeta-burdened neuron as a primary proinflammatory agent, implicating the intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta as a significant immunological component in the AD pathogenesis.",

    "title": "Depression is Associated with Tau and Not Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography in Cognitively Normal Adults.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Depression is also common with older age. Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies suggest that both cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid biomarkers are associated with more depressive symptoms in cognitively normal older adults. The recent availability of tau radiotracers offers the ability to examine in vivo tauopathy. It is unclear if the tau biomarker is associated with depression diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: We examined if tau and amyloid imaging were associated with a depression diagnosis among cognitively normal adults (Clinical Dementia Rating = 0) and whether antidepressants modified this relationship. METHODS: Among 301 participants, logistic regression models evaluated whether in vivo PET tau was associated with depression, while another model tested the interaction between PET tau and antidepressant use. A second set of models substituted PET amyloid for PET tau. A diagnosis of depression (yes/no) was made during an annual clinical assessment by a clinician. Antidepressant use (yes/no) was determined by comparing medications the participants used to a list of 30 commonly used antidepressants. All models adjusted for age, sex, education, race, and apolipoprotein e4. Similar models explored the association between the biomarkers and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Participants with elevated tau were twice as likely to be depressed. Antidepressant use modified this relationship where participants with elevated tau who were taking antidepressants had greater odds of being depressed. Relatedly, elevated amyloid was not associated with depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that tau, not amyloid, was associated with a depression diagnosis. Additionally, antidepressant use interacts with tau to increase the odds of depression among cognitively normal adults.",

METHODS: Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were obtained in 282 cognitively normal subjects (age 30-89 years). We assessed the interaction of age by abnormal amyloid PET status (Florbetapir F-18 PET >1.2 standard uptake value ratio [SUVR]) on regional mean diffusivity (MD) and global white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, controlled for sex, education, and hypertension. RESULTS: Subjects with abnormal amyloid PET (n = 87) showed stronger age-related increase in global WMH and regional MD, particularly within the posterior parietal regions of the white matter.

    "abstract": "Recent study has demonstrated that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) have the same effect to alleviate beta-amyloid pathology in the hippocampus of APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. Activation of nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is pivotal and has been demonstrated to accelerate beta-amyloid accumulation. The present study aimed to examine whether the exercise-induced beta-amyloid reduction was associated with changes in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. APP/PS1 transgenic mice were randomly assigned to a transgenic sedentary group, HIIT group and MICT group. Nontransgenic littermates were used as wild-type sedentary group. Mice in HIIT and MICT groups were subjected to treadmill exercise for 12 weeks, 5 days/week. The results showed that compared with transgenic sedentary group, beta-amyloid deposition in the hippocampus of HIIT and MICT groups were significantly reduced. Moreover, both HIIT and MICT groups displayed significant increases in the expression of microglial phagocytic receptors triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, CD36 and scavenger receptor class A compared with transgenic sedentary group. In addition, HIIT and MICT had the same effect to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as evidenced by significant reduction in IL-1beta, active caspase-1p20, NLRP3 and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activating and recruitment domain (ASC) levels as well as decreased NLRP3/ASC colocalization. These findings indicate that HIIT appears to be an effective intervention as MICT to reduced beta-amyloid deposition by regulating NLRP3 inflammasome-controlled microglial phagocytosis.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The island of New Guinea was settled by modern human over 50,000 years ago, and is currently characterized by a complex landscape and contains one-seventh of the world's languages. The Eastern Highlands of New Guinea were also the home to the devastating prion disease called kuru that primarily affected Fore-speaking populations, with some 68% of cases involving adult females. We characterized the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity of highlanders from Papua New Guinea (PNG) to: (a) gain insight into the coevolution of genes and languages in situ over mountainous landscapes; and (b) evaluate the recent influence of kuru mortality on the pattern of female gene flow. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We sequenced the mtDNA hypervariable segment 1 of 870 individuals from the Eastern and Southern Highlands of PNG using serums collected in the 1950s to 1960s. These highlanders were selected from villages representing 15 linguistic groups within the Trans-New Guinea phylum. Genetic, linguistic, and geographic distances were calculated separately and correlations among those distance matrices were assessed using the Mantel test. RESULTS: Geographic, genetic, and linguistic patterns were independently correlated with each other (p < .05). Increased mtDNA diversity in kuru-affected populations and low Fst estimates between kuru-affected linguistic groups were observed. DISCUSSION: In general, the genetic structure among the Highland populations was shaped by both geography and language, and language is a good predictor of mtDNA affinity in the PNG Highlands. High kuru female mortality increased female gene flow locally, disrupting coevolutionary pattern among genes, languages, and geography.",

    "title": "Impact of urban environmental exposures on cognitive performance and brain structure of healthy individuals at risk for Alzheimer's dementia.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Air quality might contribute to incidence of dementia-related disorders, including Alzheimer's dementia (AD). The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of urban environmental exposures (including exposure to air pollution, noise and green space) on cognitive performance and brain structure of cognitively unimpaired individuals at risk for AD. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: The ALFA (ALzheimer and FAmilies) study is a prospective cohort of middle-age, cognitively unimpaired subjects, many of them offspring of AD patients. Cognitive performance was measured by the administration of episodic memory and executive function tests (N = 958). Structural brain imaging was performed in a subsample of participants to obtain morphological information of brain areas, specially focused on cortical thickness, known to be affected by AD (N = 228). Land Use Regression models were used to estimate residential exposure to air pollutants. The daily average noise level at the street nearest to each participant's residential address was obtained from noise maps. For each participant residential green exposure indicators, such as surrounding greenness or amount of green, were generated. General linear models were conducted to assess the association between environmental exposures, cognitive performance and brain structure in a cross-sectional analysis. RESULTS: No significant associations were observed between urban environmental exposures and the cognitive composite (p > 0.1). Higher exposure to air pollutants, but not noise, was associated with lower cortical thickness in brain regions known to be affected by AD, especially NO2 (beta = -16.4; p = 0.05) and PM10 (beta = -5.34; p = 0.05). On the other hand, increasing greenness indicators was associated with greater thickness in these same areas (beta = 0.08; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: In cognitively unimpaired adults with increased risk for AD, increased exposure to air pollution was suggested to be associated with greater global atrophy and reduced volume and thickness in specific brain areas known to be affected in AD, thus suggesting a potential link between environmental exposures and cerebral vulnerability to AD. Although more research in the field is needed, air pollution reduction is crucial for decreasing the burden of age-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To explore regional variation of the macular microvasculature in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), also to detect the association between retinal macular microvascular parameters and the progress of preclinical AD. METHODS: Prospective study of healthy controls, patients with MCI and patients with AD by using Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). We quantified foveal avascular zone (FAZ) areas, densities of the superficial retinal capillary plexuses (SRCP) and deep retinal capillary plexuses (DRCP). The SRCP and DRCP were divided into inner (3 mm) and external (6 mm) annular rings, each containing four quadrants (SI, II, TI, NI, SE, IE, TE and NE). The data were analysed statistically by using SPSS 22 software. RESULTS: Totally, 60 subjects including 21 HC (33 eyes), 21 patients with MCI (32 eyes) and 18 AD patients (28 eyes) were recruited. The microvascular densities of DRCP at all quadrants of the parafovea and perifovea were significantly lower in AD patients compared to HC group (p < 0.05). Compared to the HCs, MCI patients showed significant microvascular loss in most sectors of the parafovea and the SE sector of the DRCP (p < 0.05), but not in the parafovea (p = 0.829) or perifovea (p = 0.824) of the SRCP. No significant difference was found in microvascular density of SRCP among the groups, except at SI between the AD and HC groups (p = 0.048). CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated the macular microvascular attenuation in MCI and AD patients. Both AD and MCI patients showed retinal microvascular density loss, which is more significant in the deep retinal capillary plexuses. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) can be used to identify early microvascular abnormalities in AD and MCI. Quantified microvascular density in the DRCP might serve as potential biomarkers of early sign of AD then contribute to forestall the progression of preclinical AD.",

    "abstract": "BIN1, a member of the BAR adaptor protein family, is a significant late-onset Alzheimer disease risk factor. Here, we investigate BIN1 function in the brain using conditional knockout (cKO) models. Loss of neuronal Bin1 expression results in the select impairment of spatial learning and memory. Examination of hippocampal CA1 excitatory synapses reveals a deficit in presynaptic release probability and slower depletion of neurotransmitters during repetitive stimulation, suggesting altered vesicle dynamics in Bin1 cKO mice. Super-resolution and immunoelectron microscopy localizes BIN1 to presynaptic sites in excitatory synapses. Bin1 cKO significantly reduces synapse density and alters presynaptic active zone protein cluster formation. Finally, 3D electron microscopy reconstruction analysis uncovers a significant increase in docked and reserve pools of synaptic vesicles at hippocampal synapses in Bin1 cKO mice. Our results demonstrate a non-redundant role for BIN1 in presynaptic regulation, thus providing significant insights into the fundamental function of BIN1 in synaptic physiology relevant to Alzheimer disease.",

    "abstract": "Nanoparticles based drug delivery system offers an alternative strategy to overcome several therapeutic limitations of various human ailments, particularly in age-linked Alzheimer's disease. Results of our previous cell-free studies indicated that alpha-bisabolol loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (ABS) significantly inhibited the aggregation of Abeta25-35. The present study intended to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of ABS against Abeta25-35 induced toxicity in Neuro-2a cell lines. The results of in vitro cell line study revealed that pretreatment of Neuro-2a cell lines with ABS (5 & 10 mug/ml) significantly suppressed the production of free radicals such as reactive oxygen species (ROS)/reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and also augmented the ROS mediated macromolecular damages and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential induced by toxic Abeta peptide when compared to the standard drug donepezil (50 mug/ml). Moreover, reduced beta-secretase, caspase-3, and cholinesterase activities were observed in the cells pretreated with ABS, which clearly evidenced the neuroprotective effect of ABS. Reduced expression of Bax and induced expression of Bcl-2 proteins observed through western blot analysis and live/dead cell viability analysis of Neuro-2a cells through confocal microscope further validated that ABS protects the cells from Abeta induced apoptosis. Taken together, the outcome of the present study signifies the neuroprotective effect of ABS against the Abeta induced toxicity in in vitro model of Neuro-2a cells.",

    "title": "Unraveling the complexity of amyloid polymorphism using gold nanoparticles and cryo-EM.",
    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that amyloid polymorphism gives rise to different strains of amyloids with distinct toxicities and pathology-spreading properties. Validating this hypothesis is challenging due to a lack of tools and methods that allow for the direct characterization of amyloid polymorphism in hydrated and complex biological samples. Here, we report on the development of 11-mercapto-1-undecanesulfonate-coated gold nanoparticles (NPs) that efficiently label the edges of synthetic, recombinant, and native amyloid fibrils derived from different amyloidogenic proteins. We demonstrate that these NPs represent powerful tools for assessing amyloid morphological polymorphism, using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The NPs allowed for the visualization of morphological features that are not directly observed using standard imaging techniques, including transmission electron microscopy with use of the negative stain or cryo-EM imaging. The use of these NPs to label native paired helical filaments (PHFs) from the postmortem brain of a patient with Alzheimer's disease, as well as amyloid fibrils extracted from the heart tissue of a patient suffering from systemic amyloid light-chain amyloidosis, revealed a high degree of homogeneity across the fibrils derived from human tissue in comparison with fibrils aggregated in vitro. These findings are consistent with, and strongly support, the emerging view that the physiologic milieu is a key determinant of amyloid fibril strains. Together, these advances should not only facilitate the profiling and characterization of amyloids for structural studies by cryo-EM, but also pave the way to elucidate the structural basis of amyloid strains and toxicity, and possibly the correlation between the pathological and clinical heterogeneity of amyloid diseases.",

    "abstract": "Gray matter networks (GMn) provide essential information on the intrinsic organization of the brain and appear to be disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Apolipoprotein E (APOE)-epsilon4 represents the major genetic risk factor for AD, yet the association between APOE-epsilon4 and GMn has remained unexplored. Here, we determine the impact of APOE-epsilon4 on GMn in a large sample of cognitively unimpaired individuals, which was enriched for the genetic risk of AD. We used independent component analysis to retrieve sources of structural covariance and analyzed APOE group differences within and between networks. Analyses were repeated in a subsample of amyloid-negative subjects. Compared with noncarriers and heterozygotes, APOE-epsilon4 homozygotes showed increased covariance in one network including primarily right-lateralized, parietal, inferior frontal, as well as inferior and middle temporal regions, which mirrored the formerly described AD-signature. This result was confirmed in a subsample of amyloid-negative individuals. APOE-epsilon4 carriers showed reduced covariance between two networks encompassing frontal and temporal regions, which constitute preferential target of amyloid deposition. Our data indicate that, in asymptomatic individuals, APOE-epsilon4 shapes the cerebral organization in a way that recapitulates focal morphometric alterations observed in AD patients, even in absence of amyloid pathology. This suggests that structural vulnerability in neuronal networks associated with APOE-epsilon4 may be an early event in AD pathogenesis, possibly upstream of amyloid deposition.",

Anti-beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers antibodies in immunoglobulin preparations are considered to be critical for the therapeutic effect against Alzheimer's disease. However, the antibodies content in immunoglobulin preparations varies greatly. In order to determine which factor contributes to the difference of the antibodies content, the content of anti-Abeta oligomers antibodies in multiple batches of immunoglobulin preparations from two manufacturers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that no significant difference was found in the antibodies content among different bathes of normal immunoglobulin preparations prepared by the same process from the same manufacturer, whereas significant difference was found in the antibodies content between normal immunoglobulin preparations prepared by ethanol fractionation and those by chromatography process from the same manufacturer. In addition, significant variation existed in the antibodies content between normal immunoglobulin preparations and specific immunoglobulin preparations that are produced by plasma pool of immunized donors. Based on analysis of these results, the preparation process and raw plasma could be the main contributing factors affecting the content of anti-Abeta oligomers antibodies in immunoglobulin preparations. This finding might help to develop AD-specific immunoglobulin preparation containing higher content of anti-Abeta oligomers antibodies.",

Here, we provide direct evidence that Abeta42/40 ratio, not total Abeta level, plays a critical role in inducing neurofibrillary tangles (NTFs) in human neurons. Using 3D-differentiated clonal human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) expressing varying levels of amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) with AD mutations, we show that pathogenic tau accumulation and aggregation are tightly correlated with Abeta42/40 ratio. Roles of Abeta42/40 ratio on tau pathology are also confirmed with APP transmembrane domain (TMD) mutant hNPCs, which display differential Abeta42/40 ratios without mutant PS1. Moreover, naive hNPCs co-cultured with APP TMD I45F (high Abeta42/40) cells, not with I47F cells (low Abeta42/40), develop robust tau pathology in a 3D non-cell autonomous cell culture system.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by a long progressive phase of neuronal changes, including accumulation of extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, before the onset of observable symptoms. Many efforts have been made to develop a blood-based diagnostic method for AD by incorporating Abeta and tau as plasma biomarkers. As blood tests have the advantages of being highly accessible and low cost, clinical implementation of AD blood tests would provide preventative screening to presymptomatic individuals, facilitating early identification of AD patients and, thus, treatment development in clinical research. However, the low concentration of AD biomarkers in the plasma has posed difficulties for accurate detection, hindering the development of a reliable blood test. In this review, we introduce three AD blood test technologies emerging in South Korea, which have distinctive methods of heightening detection sensitivity of specific plasma biomarkers. We discuss in detail the multimer detection system, the self-standard analysis of Abeta biomarkers quantified by interdigitated microelectrodes, and a biomarker ratio analysis comprising Abeta and tau.",

The main purpose of this study is to determine the essential structural features which are responsible for the inhibition of beta-amyloid aggregation. Prior to the development of the 2D-QSAR model, we applied a multilayered variable selection method to reduce the size of the pool of descriptors, and the final models were built by the partial least squares (PLS) regression technique. The models obtained were thoroughly analysed by applying both internal and external validation parameters. The validation metrics obtained from the analysis suggested that the developed models were significant and sufficient to predict the inhibitory activity of unknown compounds. The structural features obtained from the pharmacophore model, such as the presence of aromatic rings and hydrogen bond acceptor/donor or hydrophobic sites, are well corroborated with those of the 2D-QSAR models. Additionally, we also performed a molecular docking study to understand the molecular interactions involved in binding, and the results were then correlated with the requisite structural features obtained from the 2D-QSAR and 3D-pharmacophore models.",

OBJECTIVE: To determine the profile of biomarkers relevant to neurodegenerative disease in the CSF of patients with CAA. METHODS: We performed a detailed comparison of CSF markers, comparing patients with CAA, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and control (CS) participants, recruited from the Biomarkers and Outcomes in CAA (BOCAA) study, and a Specialist Cognitive Disorders Service. RESULTS: We included 10 CAA, 20 AD, and 10 CS participants (mean age 68.6, 62.5, and 62.2 years, respectively). In unadjusted analyses, CAA patients had a distinctive CSF biomarker profile, with significantly lower (p < 0.01) median concentrations of Abeta38, Abeta40, Abeta42, sAbetaPPalpha, and sAbetaPPbeta. CAA patients had higher levels of neurofilament light (NFL) than the CS group (p < 0.01), but there were no significant differences in CSF total tau, phospho-tau, soluble TREM2 (sTREM2), or neurogranin concentrations. AD patients had higher total tau, phospho-tau and neurogranin than CS and CAA groups. In age-adjusted analyses, differences for the CAA group remained for Abeta38, Abeta40, Abeta42, and sAbetaPPbeta. Comparing CAA patients with amyloid-PET positive (n = 5) and negative (n = 5) scans, PET positive individuals had lower (p < 0.05) concentrations of CSF Abeta42, and higher total tau, phospho-tau, NFL, and neurogranin concentrations, consistent with an \"AD-like\" profile. CONCLUSION: CAA has a characteristic biomarker profile, suggestive of a global, rather than selective, accumulation of amyloid species; we also provide evidence of different phenotypes according to amyloid-PET positivity. Further replication and validation of these preliminary findings in larger cohorts is needed.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for measurement of amyloid-beta (Abeta) species is a gold standard in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, but has risks. Thus, establishing a low-risk blood Abeta test with high AD sensitivity and specificity is of outmost interest. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the ability of a commercially available plasma Abeta assay to distinguish AD patients from biomarker-healthy controls. METHOD: In a case-control design, we examined plasma samples from 44 AD patients (A + N+) and 49 controls (A-N-) from a memory clinic. AD was diagnosed using a combination of neuropsychological examination, CSF biomarker analysis and brain imaging. Total Abeta40 and total Abeta42 in plasma were measured through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technology using ABtest40 and ABtest42 test kits (Araclon Biotech Ltd.). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses with outcome AD were performed, and sensitivity and specificity were calculated. RESULTS: Plasma Abeta42/40 was weakly positively correlated with CSF Abeta42/40 (Spearman's rho 0.22; p = 0.037). Plasma Abeta42/40 alone was not able to statistically significantly distinguish between AD patients and controls (AUC 0.58; 95% CI 0.46, 0.70). At a cut-point of 0.076 maximizing sensitivity and specificity, plasma Abeta42/40 had a sensitivity of 61.2% and a specificity of 63.6%. CONCLUSION: In this sample, the high-throughput blood Abeta assay was not able to distinguish well between AD patients and controls. Whether or not the assay may be useful in large-scale epidemiological settings remains to be seen.",

    "abstract": "The membrane binding behaviors of beta-amyloid fibrils, dimers to pentamers, from solution to lipid raft surfaces, were investigated using coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations. Our CG rafts contain phospholipid, cholesterol (with or without tail- or headgroup modifications), and with or without asymmetrically distributed monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1). All rafts exhibited liquid-ordered (Lo), liquid-disordered (Ld), and interfacial Lo/Ld (Lod) domains, with domain sizes depending on cholesterol structure. For rafts without GM1, all fibrils bound to the Lod domains. Specifically, dimer fibrils bound exclusively via the C-terminal, while larger fibrils could bind via other protein regions. Interestingly, a membrane-inserted state was detected for a trimer fibril in a raft with tail-group modified cholesterol. For rafts containing GM1, fibrils bound either to the GM1-clusters, with numerous membrane-bound conformations, or to the non-GM1-containing-Lod domains via the C-terminal. Our results indicate beta-amyloid fibrils bind to Lod domains or GM1, with diversified membrane-bound conformations, in structurally heterogeneous lipid membranes.",

    "title": "A mechanistic hypothesis for the impairment of synaptic plasticity by soluble Abeta oligomers from Alzheimer's brain.",
    "abstract": "It is increasingly accepted that early cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease results in considerable part from synaptic dysfunction caused by the accumulation of a range of oligomeric assemblies of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta). Most studies have used synthetic Abeta peptides to explore the mechanisms of memory deficits in rodent models, but recent work suggests that Abeta assemblies isolated from human (AD) brain tissue are far more potent and disease-relevant. Although reductionist experiments show Abeta oligomers to impair synaptic plasticity and neuronal viability, the responsible mechanisms are only partly understood. Glutamatergic receptors, GABAergic receptors, nicotinic receptors, insulin receptors, the cellular prion protein, inflammatory mediators, and diverse signaling pathways have all been suggested. Studies using AD brain-derived soluble Abeta oligomers suggest that only certain bioactive forms (principally small, diffusible oligomers) can disrupt synaptic plasticity, including by binding to plasma membranes and changing excitatory-inhibitory balance, perturbing mGluR, PrP, and other neuronal surface proteins, down-regulating glutamate transporters, causing glutamate spillover, and activating extrasynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors. We synthesize these emerging data into a mechanistic hypothesis for synaptic failure in Alzheimer's disease that can be modified as new knowledge is added and specific therapeutics are developed.",

Among the factors associated with gray-matter and white-matter volumes is exposure to air pollution. Using data from the UK Biobank, we sought to determine associations between several components of air pollution-PM2.5, PM2.5-10, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen oxides-and total gray-matter and total white-matter volumes in multivariable regression models in a large sample of adults. We found significant inverse associations between PM2.5 concentration and total white-matter volume and between PM2.5, PM2.5-10, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen oxide concentrations and total gray-matter volume in models adjusted for age, sex, body-mass index, self-assessment of overall health, frequency of alcohol use, smoking status, educational attainment, and income. These findings of pollutant-associated decreases in total gray-matter and total white-matter volumes are in the context of mean PM2.5 concentrations near the upper limit of the World Health Organization's recommendations. Similarly, mean PM10 concentrations were below the recommended upper limit, and nitrogen dioxide concentration was slightly above. Still, there are many areas in the world with much higher concentrations of these pollutants, which could be associated with larger effects. If replicated, these findings suggest that air pollution could be a risk factor for neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a complex etiology and characterized by cognitive deficits and memory loss. The pathogenesis of AD is not yet completely elucidated, and no curative treatment is currently available. Inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels are important for playing a key role in maintaining the resting membrane potential and controlling cell excitability, being largely expressed in both excitable and non-excitable tissues, including neurons. Accordingly, the aim of the study is to investigate the role of neuronal Kir channels in AD pathophysiology. The mRNA and protein levels of neuronal Kir2.1, Kir3.1, and Kir6.2 were evaluated by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis from the hippocampus of an amyloid-beta(Abeta)(1-42)-infused rat model of AD. Extracellular deposition of Abeta was confirmed by both histological Congo red staining and immunofluorescence analysis. Significant decreased mRNA and protein levels of Kir2.1 and Kir6.2 channels were observed in the rat model of AD, whereas no differences were found in Kir3.1 channel levels as compared with controls. Our results provide in vivo evidence that Abeta can modulate the expression of these channels, which may represent novel potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "The enzyme gamma-secretase generates beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides by cleaving amyloid protein precursor (APP); the aggregation of these peptides is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the development of various gamma-secretase regulators, their clinical use is limited by coincident disruption of other gamma-secretase-regulated substrates, such as Notch. Using a genome-wide functional screen of gamma-secretase activity in cells and a complementary DNA expression library, we found that SERP1 is a previously unknown gamma-secretase activator that stimulates Abeta generation in cells experiencing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, such as is seen with diabetes. SERP1 interacted with a subcomplex of gamma-secretase (APH1A/NCT) through its carboxyl terminus to enhance the assembly and, consequently, the activity of the gamma-secretase holoenzyme complex. In response to ER stress, SERP1 preferentially recruited APP rather than Notch into the gamma-secretase complex and enhanced the subcellular localization of the complex into lipid rafts, increasing Abeta production. Moreover, SERP1 abundance, gamma-secretase assembly, and Abeta production were increased both in cells exposed to high amounts of glucose and in diabetic AD model mice. Conversely, Abeta production was decreased by knocking down SERP1 in cells or in the hippocampi of mice. Compared to postmortem samples from control individuals, those from patients with AD showed increased SERP1 expression in the hippocampus and parietal lobe. Together, our findings suggest that SERP1 is an APP-biased regulator of gamma-secretase function in the context of cell stress, providing a possible molecular explanation for the link between diabetes and sporadic AD.",

    "title": "Multiple Bactericidal Mechanisms of the Zinc Ionophore PBT2.",
    "abstract": "Globally, more antimicrobials are used in food-producing animals than in humans, and the extensive use of medically important human antimicrobials poses a significant public health threat in the face of rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The development of novel ionophores, a class of antimicrobials used exclusively in animals, holds promise as a strategy to replace or reduce essential human antimicrobials in veterinary practice. PBT2 is a zinc ionophore with recently demonstrated antibacterial activity against several Gram-positive pathogens, although the underlying mechanism of action is unknown. Here, we investigated the bactericidal mechanism of PBT2 in the bovine mastitis-causing pathogen, Streptococcus uberis In this work, we show that PBT2 functions as a Zn2+/H+ ionophore, exchanging extracellular zinc for intracellular protons in an electroneutral process that leads to cellular zinc accumulation. Zinc accumulation occurs concomitantly with manganese depletion and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). PBT2 inhibits the activity of the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase, SodA, thereby impairing oxidative stress protection. We propose that PBT2-mediated intracellular zinc toxicity in S. uberis leads to lethality through multiple bactericidal mechanisms: the production of toxic ROS and the impairment of manganese-dependent antioxidant functions. Collectively, these data show that PBT2 represents a new class of antibacterial ionophores capable of targeting bacterial metal ion homeostasis and cellular redox balance. We propose that this novel and multitarget mechanism of PBT2 makes the development of cross-resistance to medically important antimicrobials unlikely.IMPORTANCE More antimicrobials are used in food-producing animals than in humans, and the extensive use of medically important human antimicrobials poses a significant public health threat in the face of rising antimicrobial resistance. Therefore, the elimination of antimicrobial crossover between human and veterinary medicine is of great interest. Unfortunately, the development of new antimicrobials is an expensive high-risk process fraught with difficulties. The repurposing of chemical agents provides a solution to this problem, and while many have not been originally developed as antimicrobials, they have been proven safe in clinical trials. PBT2, a zinc ionophore, is an experimental therapeutic that met safety criteria but failed efficacy checkpoints against both Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases. It was recently found that PBT2 possessed potent antimicrobial activity, although the mechanism of bacterial cell death is unresolved. In this body of work, we show that PBT2 has multiple mechanisms of antimicrobial action, making the development of PBT2 resistance unlikely.",

    "title": "Detecting earlier stages of amyloid deposition using PET in cognitively normal elderly adults.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility of using cross-sectional PET to identify cognitive decliners among beta-amyloid (Abeta)-negative cognitively normal (CN) elderly adults. METHODS: We determined the highest Abeta-affected region by ranking baseline and accumulation rates of florbetapir-PET regions in 355 CN elderly adults using 18F-florbetapir-PET from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The banks of the superior temporal sulcus (BANKSSTS) were found as the highest Abeta-affected region, and Abeta positivity in this region was defined as above the lowest boundary of BANKSSTS standardized uptake value ratio of Abeta+ (ADNI-defined COMPOSITE region) CN individuals. The entire CN cohort was divided as follows: stage 0, BANKSSTS-COMPOSITE-; stage 1, BANKSSTS+COMPOSITE-; and stage 2, BANKSSTS+COMPOSITE+. Linear mixed-effect (LME) models investigated subsequent longitudinal cognitive change, and 18F-flortaucipir (FTP)-PET was measured 4.8 +- 1.6 years later to track tau deposition. RESULTS: LME analysis revealed that individuals in stage 1 (n = 64) and stage 2 (n = 99) showed 2.5 (p < 0.05) and 4.8 (p < 0.001) times faster memory decline, respectively, than those in stage 0 (n = 191) over >4 years of mean follow-up. Compared to stage 0, both stage 1 (p < 0.05) and stage 2 (p < 0.001) predicted higher FTP in entorhinal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Nominally Abeta- CN individuals with high Abeta in BANKSSTS are at increased risk of cognitive decline, probably showing an earlier stage of Abeta deposition. Our findings may help elucidate the association between brain Abeta accumulation and cognition in Abeta- CN cohorts. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that in elderly CN individuals those with high PET-identified superior temporal sulcus Abeta burden have an increased risk of cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but diagnosis of AD in DS is challenging due to the intellectual disability which accompanies DS. When disease-modifying agents for AD are approved, reliable biomarkers will be required to identify when and how long people with DS should undergo treatment. Three cardinal neuropathological features characterize AD, and AD in DS-Abeta amyloid plaques, tau neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. Here, we quantified plasma biomarkers of all 3 neuropathological features in a large cohort of people with DS aged from 3 months to 68 years. Our primary aims were (1) to assess changes in the selected plasma biomarkers in DS across age, and (2) to compare biomarkers measured in DS plasma versus age- and sex-matched controls. METHODS: Using ultra-sensitive single molecule array (Simoa) assays, we measured 3 analytes (Abeta42, NfL, and tau) in plasmas of 100 individuals with DS and 100 age- and sex-matched controls. Tau was measured using an assay (NT1) which detects forms of tau containing at least residues 6-198. The stability of the 3 analytes was established using plasma from ten healthy volunteers collected at 6 intervals over a 5-day period. RESULTS: High Abeta42 and NT1 tau and low NfL were observed in infants. Across all ages, Abeta42 levels were higher in DS than controls. Levels of Abeta42 decreased with age in both DS and controls, but this decrease was greater in DS than controls and became prominent in the third decade of life. NT1 tau fell in adolescents and young adults, but increased in older individuals with DS. NfL levels were low in infants, children, adolescents, and young adults, but thereafter increased in DS compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of Abeta42 and tau in both young controls and DS suggest these proteins are produced by normal physiological processes, whereas the changes seen in later life are consistent with emergence of pathological alterations. These plasma biomarker results are in good agreement with prior neuropathology studies and indicate that the third and fourth decades (i.e., 20 to 40 years of age) of life are pivotal periods during which AD processes manifest in DS. Application of the assays used here to longitudinal studies of individuals with DS aged 20 to 50 years of age should further validate the use of these biomarkers, and in time may allow identification and monitoring of people with DS best suited for treatment with AD therapies.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of whole genome-sequencing (WGS) studies, family-based designs enable sex-specific analysis approaches that can be applied to only affected individuals; tests using family-based designs are attractive because they are completely robust against the effects of population substructure. These advantages make family-based association tests (FBATs) that use siblings as well as parents especially suited for the analysis of late-onset diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, the application of FBATs to assess sex-specific effects can require additional filtering steps, as sensitivity to sequencing errors is amplified in this type of analysis. Here, we illustrate the implementation of robust analysis approaches and additional filtering steps that can minimize the chances of false positive-findings due to sex-specific sequencing errors. We apply this approach to two family-based AD datasets and identify four novel loci (GRID1, RIOK3, MCPH1, ZBTB7C) showing sex-specific association with AD risk. Following stringent quality control filtering, the strongest candidate is ZBTB7C (Pinter = 1.83 x 10-7), in which the minor allele of rs1944572 confers increased risk for AD in females and protection in males. ZBTB7C encodes the Zinc Finger and BTB Domain Containing 7C, a transcriptional repressor of membrane metalloproteases (MMP). Members of this MMP family were implicated in AD neuropathology.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The plaques formed by amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation and neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyper-phosphorylated tau protein are the 2 major pathologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, autophagy is considered to be a self-degradation process of preserved cytoplasmic abnormal substances, including Abeta and tau. METHODS: alpha-Screen assay is used to discover a new mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling inhibitor, and laser scanning confocal microscopic analysis is used to investigate the autophagy formation. Lastly, ELISA and Western blot assays are used to identify the mTOR signaling inhibitor effect on Abeta and tau and the underlying mechanism. RESULTS: In the current study, we discover that dihydrotanshinone I (DTS I), extracted from Radix Salviae, can obviously inhibit mTOR phosphorylation and increase autophagy via increasing AMPK phosphorylation. Further study demonstrates that DTS I increases Abeta clearance and decreases Tau phosphorylation through autophagy enhancement involved with AMPK/mTOR pathway. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that DTS I can increase Abeta clearance and decrease Tau phosphorylation via autophagy enhancing involved with AMPK/mTOR pathway, which highlights the therapeutic potential of DTS I for the treatment of AD.",

For early identification, accurate cognitive tests cutoff values for cognitive impairment are essential. METHODS: We conducted a study on 297 cognitively healthy elderly people from the BioFINDER study and created subgroups excluding people with signs of underlying neuropathology, i.e., abnormal cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] beta-amyloid or phosphorylated tau, CSF neurofilament light (neurodegeneration), or cerebrovascular pathology. We compared cognitive test results between groups and examined the age effect on cognitive test results. RESULTS: In our subcohort without any measurable pathology (n = 120), participants achieved better test scores and significantly stricter cutoffs for cognitive impairment for almost all the examined tests. The age effect in this subcohort disappeared for all cognitive tests, apart from some attention/executive tests, predominantly explained by the exclusion of cerebrovascular pathology. CONCLUSION: Our study illustrates a new approach to establish normative data that could be useful to identify earlier cognitive changes in preclinical dementias. Future studies need to investigate if there is a genuine effect of healthy aging on cognitive tests or if this age effect is a proxy for higher prevalence of preclinical neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Autoantibodies to beta amyloid (Abeta) have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, data from clinical studies were inconsistent on autoantibody to Abeta levels in patients with AD. Therefore, we systematically searched the literature and performed meta-analysis to summarize the data of autoantibodies to Abeta in AD patients. The systematic search from PubMed and Web of Science included thirty case-control studies with a total of 2901 individuals (1311 AD patients and 1590 healthy control subjects). Random-effect meta-analysis showed a significant increased endogenous IgG autoantibody to Abeta levels in blood when compared with controls (Hedges' g = 0.337, 95% CI = 0.020 to 0.654, P = 0.03). In contrast, blood IgM autoantibody to Abeta levels was significantly decreased in patients with AD relative to control subjects (Hedges' g = - 0.962, 95% CI = - 1.797 to - 0.126, P = 0.024). Furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid Abeta levels were not significantly different between AD patients and control subjects (Hedges' g = - 0.446, 95% CI = - 2.357 to 1.464, P = 0.647). Subgroup analysis revealed that detection method contributed to the heterogeneity for studies measuring blood IgG autoantibody to Abeta levels in AD patients. Meta-regression analyses suggested that sex is a confounder for the outcome of the meta-analysis. Taken together, the results of this meta-analysis clarified circulating autoantibodies to Abeta levels in AD patients and suggested that endogenous IgG and IgM-class antibodies to Abeta may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD.",

We perturb this model with a simple model of divalent cations (Mg2+) and with a single amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide of 42 residues, both with and without a single Cu2+ ion bound to the N-terminus. In agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature, the model confirms that divalent cations locally destabilize the DMPC membrane bilayer and, for the first time, that the monomeric form of Abeta helps in avoiding the interactions between divalent cations and DMPC, preventing significant effects on the DMPC bilayer properties. These results are discussed in the frame of a protective role of the diluted Abeta peptide floating around phospholipid membranes.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess whether informant-reported apneas during sleep (witnessed apneas) in cognitively unimpaired (CU) elderly persons are associated with higher levels of brain tau. METHODS: From the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, we identified 292 CU elderly >=65 years of age with both AV-1451 tau-PET and Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET scans and whose bed partners and close relatives had completed a questionnaire that assessed whether participants had witnessed apneas during sleep. For this cross-sectional analysis, we selected the entorhinal and inferior temporal cortices as our regions of interest (ROIs) because they are highly susceptible to tau accumulation. PET signal was scaled to the cerebellum crus to calculate standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). We fit linear models to assess the association between regional tau and witnessed apneas while controlling for age, sex, years of education, body mass index, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, reduced sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness, and global PiB. RESULTS: Forty-three participants (14.7%) were found to have witnessed apneas during sleep. The report of witnessed apneas was associated with higher tau-PET SUVR elevation in our ROIs: 0.049 SUVR (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.010-0.087, p = 0.015) in the entorhinal cortex and 0.037 SUVR (95% CI 0.006-0.067, p = 0.019) in the inferior temporal cortex after controlling for confounders. CONCLUSION: We identified a significant association between witnessed apneas in CU elderly and elevated tau-PET signal in tau-susceptible brain regions. These results suggest a plausible mechanism that could contribute to cognitive impairment and the development of Alzheimer disease. Longitudinal observations are necessary to determine direction of causality.",

    "abstract": "Tau protein accumulation is a common denominator of major dementias, but this process is inhomogeneous, even when triggered by the same germline mutation. We considered stochastic misfolding of human tau conformers followed by templated conversion of native monomers as an underlying mechanism and derived sensitive conformational assays to test this concept. Assessments of brains from aged TgTauP301L transgenic mice revealed a prodromal state and three distinct signatures for misfolded tau. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)-MAPT-P301L patients with different clinical phenotypes also displayed three signatures, two resembling those found in TgTauP301L mice. As physicochemical and cell bioassays confirmed diverse tau strains in the mouse and human brain series, we conclude that evolution of diverse tau conformers is intrinsic to the pathogenesis of this uni-allelic form of tauopathy. In turn, effective therapeutic interventions in FTLD will need to address evolving repertoires of misfolded tau species rather than singular, static molecular targets.",

However, clear monitoring of the entire aggregation process of Abeta from monomer to fibril has been scarcely reported until now. Herein, we developed a label-free ratiometric surface enhanced Raman spectroscopic (SERS) platform for real-time monitoring of the entire process of Abeta aggregation in neurons and brain tissues. Different gold nanoparticles, generated in situ with Abeta monomer and fibril as templates separately, were served as effective SERS substrates to achieve a high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) down to 70 +- 4 pM and 3.0 +- 0.5 pM for Abeta40 monomer and fibrils, respectively. Besides, the introduction of ratiometric determination of Abeta monomer and fibril (I1244/I1268) realized real-time monitoring of the entire aggregation process of Abeta monomer with high accuracy and selectivity against other proteins and amino acids. The significant analytical performance of the developed platform, together with good biocompatibility, long-term stability, and remarkable spatial resolution, enabled the present SERS platform imaging and real-time monitoring and imaging of Abeta aggregation influenced by different metal ions (Cu2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+) in neurons and brain tissues at the single cell level. Our results suggested that Cu2+ and Zn2+ ion of low concentration (10 muM) promoted fibril formation, while Fe3+ and Zn2+ of high concentration (100 muM) showed inhibition of fibrosis.",

In Alzheimer's disease, different fibril structures may be associated with different clinical sub-types. Structural basis of fibril polymorphism is thus important for understanding the role of amyloid fibrils in the pathogenesis and progression of these diseases. Here we studied two types of Abeta42 fibrils prepared under quiescent and agitated conditions. Quiescent Abeta42 fibrils adopt a long and twisted morphology, while agitated fibrils are short and straight, forming large bundles via lateral association. EPR studies of these two types of Abeta42 fibrils show that the secondary structure is similar in both fibril polymorphs. At the same time, agitated Abeta42 fibrils show stronger interactions between spin labels across the full range of the Abeta42 sequence, suggesting a more tightly packed structure. Our data suggest that cross-strand side chain packing interactions within the same beta-sheet may play a critical role in the formation of polymorphic fibrils.",

In adjusted multiple linear regression models, compared to the control group (receiving placebo alone), cortical Abeta, measured once during follow-up (mean 512.7 +- 249.6 days post-baseline), was significantly lower in the groups receiving multidomain lifestyle intervention + placebo (mean difference, -0.088, 95 % CI, -0.148,-0.029, p = 0.004) or multidomain lifestyle intervention + n-3 PUFA (-0.100, 95 % CI, -0.160,-0.041, p = 0.001), but there was no difference in the n-3 PUFA supplementation alone group (-0.011, 95 % CI, -0.072,0.051, p = 0.729).

    "abstract": "A detailed understanding of the molecular pathways for amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide aggregation from monomers into amyloid fibrils, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, is crucial for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. We investigate the molecular details of peptide fibrillization in vitro by perturbing this process through addition of differently charged metal ions. Here, we used a monovalent probe, the silver ion, that, similarly to divalent metal ions, binds to monomeric Abeta peptide and efficiently modulates Abeta fibrillization. On the basis of our findings, combined with our previous results on divalent zinc ions, we propose a model that links the microscopic metal-ion binding to Abeta monomers to its macroscopic impact on the peptide self-assembly observed in bulk experiments. We found that substoichiometric concentrations of the investigated metal ions bind specifically to the N-terminal region of Abeta, forming a dynamic, partially compact complex. The metal-ion bound state appears to be incapable of aggregation, effectively reducing the available monomeric Abeta pool for incorporation into fibrils. This is especially reflected in a decreased fibril-end elongation rate. However, because the bound state is significantly less stable than the amyloid state, Abeta peptides are only transiently redirected from fibril formation, and eventually almost all Abeta monomers are integrated into fibrils. Taken together, these findings unravel the mechanistic consequences of delaying Abeta aggregation via weak metal-ion binding, quantitatively linking the contributions of specific interactions of metal ions with monomeric Abeta to their effects on bulk aggregation.",

    "title": "Amyloid Beta Secreted during Consolidation Prevents Memory Malleability.",
    "abstract": "Memory allows organisms to predict future events based on their prior sampling of the world. Rather than faithfully encoding each detail of related episodes, the brain is thought to incrementally construct probabilistic estimates of environmental statistics that are re-evaluated each time relevant events are encountered [1]. When faced with evidence that does not adequately fit mnemonic predictions, a process called reconsolidation can alter relevant memories to better recapitulate ongoing experience [2]. Conversely, when an ongoing event matches well-established predictions, reactivated memories tend to remain stable [3, 4]. In part, the brain may confer selective mnemonic stability by shifting cell-intrinsic mechanisms of plasticity induction [5], which could serve to constrain maladaptive updating of reliably predictive representations during anomalous events. Based on evidence of decreased cognitive flexibility and restricted synaptic plasticity in later life [6], we hypothesized that some prevalent age-associated neurobiological changes might in fact contribute to mnemonic stability [7]. Specifically, we predicted that amyloid beta (Abeta)-a peptide that often accumulates in the brains of individuals expressing senescent dementia [8-10]-is required for memory stabilization. Indeed, we observe elevated soluble Abetax-42 concentrations in the amygdala shortly after young adult rats form reconsolidation-resistant auditory fear memories. Suppressing secretases required for Abeta production immediately after learning prevents mnemonic stabilization, rendering these memories vulnerable to disruption by post-reactivation amnestic treatments. Thus, the seemingly pathogenic Abeta42 peptide may serve an adaptive physiological function during memory consolidation by engaging mechanisms that protect reliably predictive representations against subsequent modification.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau181 (tau phosphorylated at threonine 181) is an established biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD), reflecting abnormal tau metabolism in the brain. Here we investigate the performance of CSF p-tau217 as a biomarker of AD in comparison to p-tau181. In the Swedish BioFINDER cohort (n = 194), p-tau217 shows stronger correlations with the tau positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [18F]flortaucipir, and more accurately identifies individuals with abnormally increased [18F]flortaucipir retention. Furthermore, longitudinal increases in p-tau217 are higher compared to p-tau181 and better correlate with [18F]flortaucipir uptake. P-tau217 correlates better than p-tau181 with CSF and PET measures of neocortical amyloid-beta burden and more accurately distinguishes AD dementia from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders. Higher correlations between p-tau217 and [18F]flortaucipir are corroborated in an independent EXPEDITION3 trial cohort (n = 32). The main results are validated using a different p-tau217 immunoassay. These findings suggest that p-tau217 might be more useful than p-tau181 in the diagnostic work up of AD.",

    "abstract": "KEY POINTS: NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are key molecules for controlling neuronal plasticity, learning and memory processes. Their function is impaired during Alzheimer's disease (AD) but the exact consequence on synaptic function is not yet fully identified. An important hallmark of AD onset is represented by the neuronal accumulation of Amyloid Beta42 oligomers (Abeta42) that we have recently shown to be responsible for the increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration through ryanodine receptors (RyRs). Here we characterized the effects of Abeta42 on NMDA synapses showing specific pre- and post-synaptic functional changes that lead to a potentiation of basal and synchronous NMDA synaptic transmission. These overall effects can be abolished by decreasing Ca2+ release from RyRs with specific inhibitors that we propose as new pharmacological tools for AD treatment. ABSTRACT: We have recently shown that Amyloid Beta42 oligomers (Abeta42) cause calcium dysregulation in hippocampal neurons by stimulating Ca2+ release from ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and inhibiting Ca2+ entry through NMDA receptors (NMDARs). Here, we found that Abeta42 decrease the average NMDA-activated inward current and that Ca2+ entry through NMDARs is accompanied by Ca2+ release from the stores. The overall amount of intraellular Ca2+ concentration([Ca2+ ]i ) increase during NMDA application is 50% associated with RyR opening and 50% with NMDARs activation. Addition of Abeta42 does not change this proportion. We estimated the number of NMDARs expressed in hippocampal neurons and their unitary current. We found that Abeta42 decrease the number of NMDARs without altering their unitary current. Paradoxically, the oligomer increases the size of electrically evoked eEPSCs induced by NMDARs activation. We found that this is the consequence of the increased release probability (p) of glutamate and the number of release sites (N) of NMDA synapses, while the quantal size (q) is significantly decreased as expected from the decreased number of NMDARs. An increased number of release sites induced by Abeta42 is also supported by the increased size of the ready releasable pool (RRPsyn) and by the enhanced percentage of paired pulse depression (PPD). Interestingly, the RyRs inhibitor dantrolene prevents the increase of PPD induced by Abeta42 oligomers. In conclusion, Abeta42 up-regulates NMDA synaptic responses with a mechanism involving RyRs that occurs during the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset. This suggests that new selective modulators of RyRs may be useful for designing effective therapies to treat AD patients.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) therapeutics based on the amyloid hypothesis have repeatedly failed in clinical trials. Together with numerous reports that amyloid is present in brains from aged individuals without cognitive dysfunction, this suggests that the association of amyloid with AD is collateral rather than causal. However, the preeminence of the amyloid hypothesis has resulted in the 'systematic ...thwart[ing of] alternative approaches' to AD/dementia driven by a 'cabal' of amyloid acolytes who have effectively controlled the ideas funded and published, which startups received venture investment and which programs were advanced in biopharmaceutical companies where they consulted. As a result, dementia research is estimated to be 15-30 years behind where it could be with conflicting data ignored in favor of the amyloid dogma and clinical trial failures being ascribed to faulty design or inadequacies in the compound selection process including flawed animal models. Major concerns regarding the precise diagnosis of AD/dementia and conflicting views on the validated status of fluid biomarker assays have resulted in trials that included patients with unknown amyloid pathologies. With the failure of the amyloid approach, emerging data on the role(s) of vascular, mitochondrial and synaptic network dysfunction, infection, diabetes, sleep, hearing loss, the gut microbiome and neuroinflammation/ innate immune function as dementia targets are driving research in new directions bolstered by recent findings on the genetic, omics and systems biology associated with AD/dementia. In moving forward, lessons learnt from the amyloid debacle should be used to enhance the objective identification of AD/dementia therapeutics as a multifactorial disease syndrome.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid cascade hypothesis (ACH) has dominated contemporary biomedical research into Alzheimer's disease (AD) since the 1990 s but still lacks definitive confirmation by successful clinical trials of anti-amyloid medicines in human AD. In this uncertain period regarding the centrality of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in AD pathophysiology, and with the community apparently divided about the ACH's validity, we used citation practices as a proxy for measuring how researchers have invested their belief in the hypothesis between 1992 and 2019. We sampled 445 articles citing Hardy & Higgins (1992, \"HH92\") and classified the polarity of their HH92 citation according to Greenberg (2009)'s citation taxonomy of positive, neutral, and negative citations, and then tested four hypotheses. We identified two major attitudes towards HH92: a majority (62%) of neutral attitudes with consistent properties across the time period, and a positive attitude (35%), tending to cite HH92 earlier on within the bibliography as time went by, tending to take HH92 as an established authority. Despite the majority of neutral HH92 citations, there was a positive majority of attitudes toward different versions of the ACH and anti-amyloid therapeutic strategies (65%), suggesting that the ACH has been dominant and has undergone significant refinement since 1992. Finally, of those 110 original articles within the sample also testing the ACH empirically, an overwhelming majority (89%) returned a pro-ACH test result, suggesting that the ACH's central claim is reproducible. Further studies will quantify the extent to which results from different methods within such original studies convergence to provide a robust conclusion vis-a-vis Abeta's pathogenicity in AD.",

    "title": "Medial temporal lobe connectivity and its associations with cognition in early Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Human episodic memory critically depends on subregions of the medial temporal lobe, which are part of functional brain systems such as the anterior-temporal and the posterior-medial system. Here we analysed how Alzheimer's pathology affects functional connectivity within these systems. Data from 256 amyloid-beta-negative cognitively unimpaired, 103 amyloid-beta-positive cognitively unimpaired, and 83 amyloid-beta-positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment were analysed. Amyloid-beta and tau pathology were measured using the CSF amyloid-beta42/40 ratio and phosphorylated tau, respectively. We found that amyloid-beta-positive cognitively unimpaired individuals were mainly characterized by decreased functional connectivity between the medial temporal lobe and regions in the anterior-temporal system, most prominently between left perirhinal/entorhinal cortices and medial prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, correlation analysis in this group revealed decreasing functional connectivity between bilateral perirhinal/entorhinal cortices, anterior hippocampus and posterior-medial regions with increasing levels of phosphorylated tau. The amyloid-beta-positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment mostly exhibited reduced connectivity between the medial temporal lobe and posterior-medial regions, predominantly between the anterior hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex. In addition, they showed hyperconnectivity within the medial temporal lobe and its immediate proximity. Lower medial temporal-cortical functional connectivity networks resulting from the group comparisons of cognitively unimpaired individuals were associated with reduced memory performance and more rapid longitudinal memory decline as shown by linear mixed-effects regression analysis. Finally, we found that reduced medial temporal-cortical connectivity in mildly cognitively impaired individuals was related to reduced entorhinal thickness and white matter integrity of the parahippocampal cingulum and the fornix. No such relationships were found in cognitively unimpaired individuals. In conclusion, our findings show that the earliest changes in preclinical Alzheimer's disease might involve decreased connectivity within the anterior-temporal system, and early changes in connectivity might be related to memory impairment, but not to structural changes. With disease progression and increased tau pathology, medial temporal functional connectivity with posterior-medial regions seems to be increasingly impaired. In individuals with mild cognitive impairment, reduced functional connectivity is associated with structural brain changes as well as the emergence of locally increased connectivity patterns. Thus, functional connectivity between the medial temporal lobe and the anterior-temporal and posterior-medial system could serve as stage-specific functional markers in early Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 TREM2 was identified as a risk factor for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we compared TREM2 cases with a variant (TREM2+ ) and cases without a TREM2 variant (TREM2- ), considering pathological burden, inflammatory response and altered canonical pathways and biochemical functions between the cohorts. We hypothesised that TREM2+ cases would have a loss of function, indicating an altered inflammatory profile compared to TREM2- cases. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies against Abeta, tau and microglia markers in TREM2+ cases, with and without AD, which were compared to sporadic TREM2- AD, familial AD and neurologically normal control cases. Abeta and tau load were measured along with the composition of Abeta plaques, in addition to microglial load and circularity. Expression and proteomic profiles were determined from the frontal cortex of selected cases. TREM2+ control cases had no Abeta or tau deposition. No differences in the amount of Abeta or tau, or the composition of Abeta plaques were observed between TREM2+ and TREM2- SAD cases. There were no differences in microglial load observed between disease groups. However, the TREM2+ SAD cases showed more amoeboid microglia than the TREM2- SAD cases, although no differences in the spatial relationship of microglia and Abeta plaques were identified. Visualisation of the canonical pathways and biological functions showed differences between the disease groups and the normal controls, clearly showing a number of pathways upregulated in TREM2+ SAD, TREM2- SAD and FAD groups whilst, the TREM2+ controls cases showed a downregulation of the majority of the represented pathways. These findings suggest that the TREM2+ control group, although carrying the TREM2+ variant, have no pathological hallmarks of AD, have altered microglial and expression profiles compared to the TREM2+ SAD cases. This indicates that other unknown factors may initiate the onset of AD, with TREM2 influencing the microglial involvement in disease pathogenesis.",

In this research, we improved the detection of amyloid beta peptide aggregates in vitro and ex vivo by fluorescence combining the use of CRANAD-2 and gold nanorods (GNRs) by the surface enhancement fluorescence effect. We synthetized GNRs and modified their surface with HS-PEG-OMe and HS-PEG-COOH and functionalized them with the D1 peptide, which has the capability to selectively bind to amyloid beta peptide. For an in vitro detection of amyloid beta peptide, we co-incubated amyloid beta peptide aggregates with the probe CRANAD-2 and GNR-PEG-D1 observing an increase in the intensity of the fluorescence signal attributed to surface enhancement fluorescence. Furthermore, the surface enhancement fluorescence effect was observed in brain slices of transgenic mice with Alzheimer s disease co-incubated with CRANAD-2 and GNR-PEG-D1. An increase in the fluorescence signal was observed allowing the detection of aggregates that cannot be detected with the single use of CRANAD-2. Gold nanoparticles allowed an improvement in the detection of the amyloid aggregated by fluorescence in vitro and ex vivo.",

    "title": "Long-term exposure to air pollution and trajectories of cognitive decline among older adults.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and cognitive decline in older adults residing in an urban area. METHODS: Data for this study were obtained from 2 prospective cohorts of residents in the northern Manhattan area of New York City: the Washington Heights-Inwood Community Aging Project (WHICAP) and the Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS). Participants of both cohorts received in-depth neuropsychological testing at enrollment and during follow-up. In each cohort, we used inverse probability weighted linear mixed models to evaluate the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between markers of average residential ambient air pollution (nitrogen dioxide [NO2], fine particulate matter [PM2.5], and respirable particulate matter [PM10]) levels in the year prior to enrollment and measures of global and domain-specific cognition, adjusting for sociodemographic factors, temporal trends, and censoring. RESULTS: Among 5,330 participants in WHICAP, an increase in NO2 was associated with a 0.22 SD lower global cognitive score at enrollment (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.30, -0.14) and 0.06 SD (95% CI, -0.08, -0.04) more rapid decline in cognitive scores between visits. Results were similar for PM2.5 and PM10 and across functional cognitive domains. We found no evidence of an association between pollution and cognitive function in NOMAS. CONCLUSION: WHICAP participants living in areas with higher levels of ambient air pollutants have lower cognitive scores at enrollment and more rapid rates of cognitive decline over time. In NOMAS, a smaller cohort with fewer repeat measurements, we found no statistically significant associations. These results add to the evidence regarding the adverse effect of air pollution on cognitive aging and brain health.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In mice there might be an association between sleep deprivation and amyloid beta plasma levels. Hence, we examined whether amyloid plasma levels are associated with sleep duration or fragmentation in 17 psychiatrists on-call. METHODS: Amyloid beta (Abeta)42, Abeta40, and soluble amyloid precursor protein beta (sAPP-beta) plasma concentrations were measured at the beginning and end of 90 on-call nights, and analyzed using generalized linear models. RESULTS: In on-call nights, a 10.7% reduction of Abeta42 was revealed overnight. Every single short sleep interruption diminished this reduction by 5.4%, as well as every pg/mL of sAPP-beta by 1.2%, each copy of APOE epsilon4 by 10.6%, and each year of professional experience by 3.0%. DISCUSSION: The extent of sleep fragmentation diminishes the physiological overnight reduction of Abeta42 but not Abeta40 plasma levels in the same direction as the enzyme for Abeta42 production, the genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and on-call experience. Might on-call duty and sleep fragmentation in general alter the risk for AD?",

    "abstract": "The extracellular transporter, lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS) binds to heme and heme metabolites with high affinity. It has been reported that L-PGDS protects neuronal cells against apoptosis induced by exposure to hydrogen peroxide. Our study demonstrates that when human WT L-PGDS is in complex with heme, it exhibits a strong peroxidase activity thus behaving as a pseudo-peroxidase. Electron paramagnetic resonance studies confirm that heme in the L-PGDS-heme complex is hexacoordinated with high-spin Fe(III). NMR titration of heme in L-PGDS points to hydrophobic interaction between heme and several residues within the beta-barrel cavity of L-PGDS. In addition to the transporter function, L-PGDS is a key amyloid beta chaperone in human cerebrospinal fluid. The presence of high levels of bilirubin and its derivatives, implicated in Alzheimer's disease, by binding to L-PGDS may reduce its chaperone activity. Nevertheless, our ThT binding assay establishes that heme and heme metabolites do not significantly alter the neuroprotective chaperone function of L-PGDS. Guided by NMR data we reconstructed the heme L-PGDS complex using extensive molecular dynamics simulations providing a platform for mechanistic interpretation of the catalytic and transporting functions and their modulation by secondary ligands like Abeta peptides and heme metabolites.",

    "abstract": "Some mutations which occur in the alpha/beta-discordant region (resides 15 to 23) of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) lead to familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). In vitro studies have shown that these genetic mutations could accelerate Abeta aggregation. We recently showed that mutations in this region could alter the structural propensity, resulting in a different aggregative propensity of Abeta. Whether these genetic mutations display similar effects remains largely unknown. Here, we characterized the structural propensity and aggregation kinetics of Dutch-type Abeta40 (Abeta40(E22Q)) and its L17A/F19A-substituted mutant (Abeta40(L17A/F19A/E22Q)) using circular dichroism spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic spectroscopy, and thioflavin T fluorescence assay. In comparison with wild-type Abeta40, we found that Dutch-type mutation, unlike Artic-type mutation (E22G), does not reduce the alpha-helical propensity of the alpha/beta-discordant region in sodium dodecyl sulfate micellar solution. Moreover, we found that Abeta40(L17A/F19A/E22Q) displays a higher alpha-helical propensity of the alpha/beta-discordant region and a slower aggregation rate than Abeta40(E22Q), suggesting that the inhibition of aggregation might be via increasing the alpha-helical propensity of the alpha/beta-discordant region, similar to that observed in wild-type and Artic-type Abeta40. Taken together, Dutch-type and Artic-type mutations adopt different mechanisms to promote Abeta aggregation, however, the L17A/F19A mutation could increase the alpha-helical propensities of both Dutch-type and Artic-type Abeta40 and inhibit their aggregation.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify the hippocampal subregions linking initial amyloid and tau pathology to memory performance in clinically normal older individuals, reflecting preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: A total of 127 individuals from the Harvard Aging Brain Study (mean age 76.22 +- 6.42 years, 68 women [53.5%]) with a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0, a flortaucipir tau-PET scan, a Pittsburgh compound B amyloid-PET scan, a structural MRI scan, and cognitive testing were included. From these images, we calculated neocortical, hippocampal, and entorhinal amyloid pathology; entorhinal and hippocampal tau pathology; and the volumes of 6 hippocampal subregions and total hippocampal volume. Memory was assessed with the selective reminding test. Mediation and moderation analyses modeled associations between regional markers and memory. Analyses included covariates for age, sex, and education. RESULTS: Neocortical amyloid, entorhinal tau, and presubiculum volume univariately associated with memory performance. The relationship between neocortical amyloid and memory was mediated by entorhinal tau and presubiculum volume, which was modified by hippocampal amyloid burden. With other biomarkers held constant, presubiculum volume was the only marker predicting memory performance in the total sample and in individuals with elevated hippocampal amyloid burden. CONCLUSIONS: The presubiculum captures unique AD-related biological variation that is not reflected in total hippocampal volume. Presubiculum volume may be a promising marker of imminent memory problems and can contribute to understanding the interaction between incipient AD-related pathologies and memory performance. The modulation by hippocampal amyloid suggests that amyloid is a necessary, but not sufficient, process to drive neurodegeneration in memory-related regions.",

Klotho-VS heterozygosity (KL-VSHET+ status) protects against aging-associated phenotypes and cognitive decline, but whether it protects individuals who carry APOE4 from AD remains unclear. Objectives: To determine if KL-VSHET+ status is associated with reduced AD risk and beta-amyloid (Abeta) pathology in individuals who carry APOE4. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study combined 25 independent case-control, family-based, and longitudinal AD cohorts that recruited referred and volunteer participants and made data available through public repositories. Analyses were stratified by APOE4 status. Three cohorts were used to evaluate conversion risk, 1 provided longitudinal measures of Abeta CSF and PET, and 3 provided cross-sectional measures of Abeta CSF. Genetic data were available from high-density single-nucleotide variant microarrays. All data were collected between September 2015 and September 2019 and analyzed between April 2019 and December 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The risk of AD was evaluated through logistic regression analyses under a case-control design. The risk of conversion to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD was evaluated through competing risks regression. Associations with Abeta, measured from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or brain positron emission tomography (PET), were evaluated using linear regression and mixed-effects modeling. Results: Of 36 530 eligible participants, 13 782 were excluded for analysis exclusion criteria or refusal to participate. Participants were men and women aged 60 years and older who were non-Hispanic and of Northwestern European ancestry and had been diagnosed as being cognitively normal or having MCI or AD. The sample included 20 928 participants in case-control studies, 3008 in conversion studies, 556 in Abeta CSF regression analyses, and 251 in PET regression analyses. The genotype KL-VSHET+ was associated with reduced risk for AD in individuals carrying APOE4 who were 60 years or older (odds ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.67-0.84]; P = 7.4 x 10-7), and this was more prominent at ages 60 to 80 years (odds ratio, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.61-0.79]; P = 3.6 x 10-8). Additionally, control participants carrying APOE4 with KL-VS heterozygosity were at reduced risk of converting to MCI or AD (hazard ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.44-0.94]; P = .02). Finally, in control participants who carried APOE4 and were aged 60 to 80 years, KL-VS heterozygosity was associated with higher Abeta in CSF (beta, 0.06 [95% CI, 0.01-0.10]; P = .03) and lower Abeta on PET scans (beta, -0.04 [95% CI, -0.07 to -0.00]; P = .04). Conclusions and Relevance: The genotype KL-VSHET+ is associated with reduced AD risk and Abeta burden in individuals who are aged 60 to 80 years, cognitively normal, and carrying APOE4. Molecular pathways associated with KL merit exploration for novel AD drug targets. The KL-VS genotype should be considered in conjunction with the APOE genotype to refine AD prediction models used in clinical trial enrichment and personalized genetic counseling.",

By developing a general approach that combines theory, experiment and simulation, we reveal, in molecular detail, the mechanisms of Abeta42 oligomer dynamics during amyloid fibril formation. Even though all mature amyloid fibrils must originate as oligomers, we found that most Abeta42 oligomers dissociate into their monomeric precursors without forming new fibrils. Only a minority of oligomers converts into fibrillar structures. Moreover, the heterogeneous ensemble of oligomeric species interconverts on timescales comparable to those of aggregation. Our results identify fundamentally new steps that could be targeted by therapeutic interventions designed to combat protein misfolding diseases.",

This module was enriched in AD genetic risk factors and in microglia and astrocyte protein markers associated with an anti-inflammatory state, suggesting that the biological functions it represents serve a protective role in AD. Proteins from this module were elevated in cerebrospinal fluid in early stages of the disease.

After confirming faster aggregation of Abeta-42 in comparison to Abeta-40, a stable set of oligomers with a diameter distribution of ~7 to 9 nm was prevalently observed uniquely for Abeta-42 even after fibril appearance. The interaction energies between a distinct class of amyloid aggregates (dodecamers) and graphene was then quantified using molecular dynamics simulations. Last, differences in Abeta-40 and Abeta-42 networks were resolved, wherein only Abeta-42 fibrils were aligned through lateral interactions over micrometer-scale lengths, a property that could be exploited in the design of biofunctional materials.",

The molecular basis of this interaction is, however, not well understood. We have employed magic angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR spectroscopy to characterize Abeta-PET tracer complexes at atomic resolution. We established a titration protocol by using bovine serum albumin as a carrier to transfer hydrophobic small molecules to Abeta(1-40) fibrillar aggregates. The same Abeta(1-40) amyloid fibril sample was employed in subsequent titrations to minimize systematic errors that potentially arise from sample preparation. In the experiments, the small molecules 13 C-methylated Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) as well as a novel Abeta tracer based on a diarylbithiazole (DABTA) scaffold were employed. Classical 13 C-detected as well as proton-detected spectra of protonated and perdeuterated samples with back-substituted protons, respectively, were acquired and analyzed. After titration of the tracers, chemical-shift perturbations were observed in the loop region involving residues Gly25-Lys28 and Ile32-Gly33, thus suggesting that the PET tracer molecules interact with the loop region connecting beta-sheets beta1 and beta2 in Abeta fibrils. We found that titration of the PiB derivatives suppressed fibril polymorphism and stabilized the amyloid fibril structure.",

    "abstract": "The spread of protein aggregates during disease progression is a common theme underlying many neurodegenerative diseases. The microtubule-associated protein tau has a central role in the pathogenesis of several forms of dementia known as tauopathies-including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy1. Progression of these diseases is characterized by the sequential spread and deposition of protein aggregates in a predictable pattern that correlates with clinical severity2. This observation and complementary experimental studies3,4 have suggested that tau can spread in a prion-like manner, by passing to naive cells in which it templates misfolding and aggregation. However, although the propagation of tau has been extensively studied, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) controls the endocytosis of tau and its subsequent spread. Knockdown of LRP1 significantly reduced tau uptake in H4 neuroglioma cells and in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. The interaction between tau and LRP1 is mediated by lysine residues in the microtubule-binding repeat region of tau. Furthermore, downregulation of LRP1 in an in vivo mouse model of tau spread was found to effectively reduce the propagation of tau between neurons. Our results identify LRP1 as a key regulator of tau spread in the brain, and therefore a potential target for the treatment of diseases that involve tau spread and aggregation.",

The lacuna in establishing the structure to function relationship for Abeta oligomers prevents the development of an effective treatment for AD. While the transient and heterogeneous properties of Abeta oligomers impose many challenges for structural investigation, an effective use of a combination of NMR techniques has successfully identified and characterized them at atomic-resolution. Here, we review the successful utilization of solution and solid-state NMR techniques to probe the aggregation and structures of small and large oligomers of Abeta. Biophysical studies utilizing the commonly used solution and 19F based NMR experiments to identify the formation of small size early intermediates and to obtain their structures, and dock-lock mechanism of fiber growth at atomic-resolution are discussed. In addition, the use of proton-detected magic angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR experiments to obtain high-resolution insights into the aggregation pathways and structures of large oligomers and other aggregates is also presented. We expect these NMR based studies to be valuable for real-time monitoring of the depletion of monomers and the formation of toxic oligomers and high-order aggregates under a variety of conditions, and to solve the high-resolution structures of small and large size oligomers for most amyloid proteins, and therefore to develop inhibitors and drugs.",

Age was the strongest predictor of WMH (partial R2~16%) compared with CSF Abeta1-42 (partial R2~5%). There was no evidence for an association with WMH and either t-tau or p-tau.

The main goal of this study was to evaluate the expression of miR4422 and miR3714, as the main regulators of GSAP and BACE1 expression, in AD patients compared with healthy subjects. Twenty patients with a mild to moderate AD (58-71 years old) and 15 healthy subjects (58-73 years old) participated in this study. The expression levels of miR4422 and miR3714 as the target genes and 5S rRNA and miRlet7a-5p as the reference genes were measured in the two groups. To compare the expression between the case and the control groups, the t test or the Wilcoxon test was used, based on the data distribution patterns. The efficiencies of amplification of the miR4422, miR3714, 5S rRNA, and miRlet7a-5p genes all were in the acceptable range. The mean miR4422-5S rRNA dCt value was significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.018). The relative fold change of the expression was 0.43. The mean miR4422-miRlet7a-5p dCt value (p = 0.41), the mean miR3714-5S rRNA dCt value (p = 0.10), and the mean miR3714-miRlet7a-5p dCt value (p = 0.063) were not significantly different between the two groups.

Abeta is produced via the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. However, the precise regulatory mechanism of Abeta generation still remains unclear. To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of Abeta production, we established a genetic screening method based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system to identify novel regulators of Abeta production. We successfully identified calcium and integrin-binding protein 1 (CIB1) as a potential negative regulator of Abeta production. The disruption of Cib1 significantly upregulated Abeta levels. In addition, immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that CIB1 interacts with the gamma-secretase complex. Moreover, the disruption of Cib1 specifically reduced the cell-surface localization of mature Nicastrin (Nct), which is a component of the gamma-secretase complex, without changing the intrinsic activity of gamma-secretase. Finally, we confirmed using the single-cell RNA-seq data in human that CIB1 mRNA level in neuron was decreased in the early stage of AD. Taken together, our results indicate that CIB1 regulates Abeta production via controlling the subcellular localization of gamma-secretase, suggesting CIB1 is involved in the development of AD.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Blood biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have attracted much attention of researchers in recent years. In clinical studies, repeated freeze/thaw cycles often occur and may influence the stability of biomarkers. This study aims to investigate the stability of amyloid-beta 1-40 (Abeta<sub>1-40</sub>), amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta<sub>1-42</sub>), and total tau protein (T-tau) in plasma over freeze/thaw cycles. Methods: Plasma samples from healthy controls (n = 2), AD patients (AD, n =3) and Parkinson's disease patients (PD, n = 3) were collected by standardized procedure and immediately frozen at -80 C. Samples underwent 5 freeze/thaw (-80 C/room temperature) cycles. The concentrations of Abeta<sub>1-40</sub>, Abeta<sub>1-42</sub>, and T-tau were monitored during the freeze/thaw tests using an immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) assay. The relative percentage of concentrations after every freeze/thaw cycle was calculated for each biomarker. Results: A tendency of decrease in the averaged relative percentages over samples through the freeze and thaw cycles for Abeta<sub>1-40</sub> (100 to 97.11%), Abeta<sub>1-42</sub> (100 to 94.99%), and T-tau (100 to 95.65%) was found. However, the decreases were less than 6%. For all three biomarkers, no statistical significance was found between the levels of fresh plasma and those of the plasma experiencing 5 freeze/thaw cycles (p > 0.1). Conclusions: Plasma Abeta<sub>1-40</sub>, Abeta<sub>1-42</sub>, and T-tau are stable through 5 freeze/thaw cycles measured with IMR.",

    "abstract": "Several atomic structures have now been found for micrometer-scale amyloid fibrils or elongated microcrystals using a range of methods, including NMR, electron microscopy, and X-ray crystallography, with parallel beta-sheet appearing as the most common secondary structure. The etiology of amyloid disease, however, indicates nanometer-scale assemblies of only tens of peptides as significant agents of cytotoxicity and contagion. By combining solution X-ray with molecular dynamics, we show that antiparallel structure dominates at the first stages of aggregation for a specific set of peptides, being replaced by parallel at large length scales only. This divergence in structure between small and large amyloid aggregates should inform future design of molecular therapeutics against nucleation or intercellular transmission of amyloid. Calculations and an overview from the literature argue that antiparallel order should be the first appearance of structure in many or most amyloid aggregation processes, regardless of the endpoint. Exceptions to this finding should exist, depending inevitably on the sequence and on solution conditions.",

    "title": "Aberrant interactions between amyloid-beta and alpha5 laminins as possible driver of neuronal disfunction in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "It has been widely accepted that laminins are involved in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid plaques in AD patients are associated with immunostaining using antibodies raised against laminin-111, and laminin-111 has been shown to prevent aggregation of amyloid peptides. Although numerous articles describe small peptides from laminin-111 that are capable to disaggregate amyloid buildups and reduce neurotoxicity in in vitro and in vivo models, there is no approved laminin-111-based therapeutic approaches for treatment of AD. Also, it has been shown that immunoreactivity to laminin-111 appears late in development of cerebral amyloidosis. Based on the published data, we hypothesize that aberrant interaction between amyloid-beta and alpha5-laminins such as laminin-511 prevents the necessary laminin signaling into neurons leading to neurodegeneration and contributing to the early development of AD. Laminin-511 is the key extracellular protein that protects neurons from anoikis, inhibits excitoxicity and provides signaling that stabilizes dendritic spines and synapses in the developed brain. Absence of the signaling from laminin-511 leads to behavioral defects in mice. Laminin-511 and hippocampal neurons are in direct contact and accumulation of amyloid-beta that has been shown to avidly bind laminin-511 may physically decouple the interaction between alpha5-laminins and the neuronal membrane receptors inhibiting the signaling. Under this hypothesis, protein domains and peptides from laminin alpha5 chain may have a therapeutic potential in treatment of AD and the appearance of laminin-111 in the amyloid plaques is simply a consequence of the disease.",

Soluble AbetaOs have been extensively studied for their synaptotoxic and neurotoxic properties. In this review, we discuss physicochemical properties of AbetaOs and their impact on different brain cell types in AD. Additionally, we summarize three decades of studies with AbetaOs, providing a compelling bulk of evidence regarding cell-specific mechanisms of toxicity.

While the transcriptome profile of microglia directs microglial functions, how the microglial transcriptome can be regulated to alleviate AD pathology is largely unknown. Here, we show that injection of interleukin (IL)-33 in an AD transgenic mouse model ameliorates Abeta pathology by reprogramming microglial epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles to induce a microglial subpopulation with enhanced phagocytic activity. These IL-33-responsive microglia (IL-33RMs) express a distinct transcriptome signature that is highlighted by increased major histocompatibility complex class II genes and restored homeostatic signature genes. IL-33-induced remodeling of chromatin accessibility and PU.1 transcription factor binding at the signature genes of IL-33RM control their transcriptome reprogramming. Specifically, disrupting PU.1-DNA interaction abolishes the microglial state transition and Abeta clearance that is induced by IL-33. Thus, we define a PU.1-dependent transcriptional pathway that drives the IL-33-induced functional state transition of microglia, resulting in enhanced Abeta clearance.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with irreversible neurodegeneration. Accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) in the brain is considered to be a major cause of neuronal cell death in AD, but the neurotoxic mechanism of Abeta is not yet fully understood. Here, we focused on the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in Abeta-induced neuronal cell death. In microarray and RT-qPCR analysis of plasma miRNAs obtained from 5 familiar AD mutations (5xFAD) and wild-type (WT) mice of various ages, miR-16-5p showed a significant age-related change that was accompanied by neuronal cell death in the brain tissue of 5xFAD mice. In addition, increased miR-16-5p was prominent near Abeta plaque-deposition sites in 5xFAD mouse brains. Abeta treatment induced miR-16-5p upregulation and apoptosis in primary cultured mouse cortical neurons and the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line. In silico analysis and reporter gene assays indicated that miR-16-5p directly targets the mRNA encoding the anti-apoptotic factor, B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), in the neuronal cell line. Overexpression of miR-16-5p in SH-SY5Y cells downregulated BCL-2 expression and induced apoptosis. These results collectively suggest that the miR-16-5p/BCL-2 axis plays an important role for neuronal cell apoptosis in AD.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients often suffer from sleep disturbances. Alterations in sleep, especially rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), can precede the onset of dementia. To accurately characterize the sleep impairments accompanying AD and their underlying mechanisms using animal models, it is crucial to use models in which brain areas are affected in a manner similar to that observed in the actual patients. Here, we focused on AppNL-G-F mice, in which expression levels and patterns of mutated amyloid precursor protein (APP) follow the endogenous patterns. We characterized the sleep architecture of male AppNL-G-F homozygous and heterozygous mice at two ages (six and 12 months). At six months, homozygous mice exhibited reduced REMS, which was further reduced at 12 months together with a slight reduction in non-REMS (NREMS). By contrast, heterozygous mice exhibited an overall normal sleep architecture. Homozygous mice also exhibited decreased electroencephalogram gamma to delta power ratio during REMS from six months, resembling the electroencephalogram slowing phenomenon observed in preclinical or early stages of AD. In addition, homozygous mice showed learning and memory impairments in the trace fear conditioning (FC) at both ages, and task performance strongly correlated with REMS amount at 12 months. Finally, histologic analyses revealed that amyloid-beta accumulation in the pontine tegmental area and ventral medulla followed a course similar to that of the REMS reduction. These findings support the notion that changes in REMS are an early marker of AD and provide a starting point to address the mechanism of sleep deficits in AD and the effects on cognition.",

Therefore, a blood-based marker for such pathophysiology would have greater utility in a primary care setting and in eligibility screening for clinical trials. Rapid advances in ultra-sensitive assays have enabled the levels of pathological proteins to be measured in blood samples, but research has been predominantly focused on Alzheimer disease (AD). Nonetheless, proteins that were identified as potential blood-based biomarkers for AD, for example, amyloid-beta, tau, phosphorylated tau and neurofilament light chain, are likely to be relevant to other neurodegenerative disorders that involve similar pathological processes and could also be useful for the differential diagnosis of clinical symptoms. This Review outlines the neuropathological, clinical, molecular imaging and cerebrospinal fluid features of the most common neurodegenerative disorders outside the AD continuum and gives an overview of the current status of blood-based biomarkers for these disorders.",

    "title": "Ability of selenium species to inhibit metal-induced Abeta aggregation involved in the development of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Extracellular accumulation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) is believed to be one of the main factors responsible for neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Metals could induce Abeta aggregation, by their redox activity or binding properties to amyloid beta fibrils, leading to their accumulation and deposition outside neurons. For this reason, metal chelation may have an acknowledged part to play in AD prevention and treatment. In the current work, the role of different selenium species, including selenium nanoparticles, in Abeta aggregation, was studied by evaluating their metal-chelating properties and their ability both to inhibit metal-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation fibrils and to disaggregate them once formed. Transition biometals such as Fe(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) at 50 muM were selected to establish the in vitro models. The DPPH assay was used to determine the antioxidant capacity of the evaluated selenium species. Selenium nanoparticles stabilized with chitosan (Ch-SeNPs) and with both chitosan and chlorogenic acid polyphenol (CGA@ChSeNPs) showed the highest antioxidant properties with EC50 of 0.9 and 0.07 mM, respectively. UV-Vis and d1(UV-Vis) spectra also revealed that selenium species, in particular selenomethionine (SeMet), were able to interact with metals. Regarding Abeta1-42 incubation experiments, Fe(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) induced Abeta aggregation, in a similar way to most of the evaluated selenium species. However, Ch-SeNPs produced a high inhibition of metal-induced Abeta aggregation, as well as a high disaggregation capacity of Abeta fibrils in both the presence and absence of biometals, in addition to reducing the length and width (20% of reduction in the presence of Zn(II)) of the generated Abeta fibrils.

METHODS: We utilized antemortem structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to measure MTL substructures and examined the relative contribution of tau, TDP-43, Abeta, and alpha-synuclein measured in post-mortem tissue from 92 individuals with intermediate to high AD neuropathology. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were analyzed for each subregion in order to discriminate TDP-43-negative and TDP-43-positive patients. RESULTS: TDP-43 was strongly associated with anterior MTL regions, whereas tau was relatively more associated with the posterior hippocampus. Among the MTL regions, the anterior hippocampus showed the highest area under the ROC curve (AUC). DISCUSSION: We found specific contributions of different pathologies on MTL substructure in this population with AD neuropathology. The anterior hippocampus may be a relevant region to detect concomitant TDP-43 pathology in the MTL of patients with AD.",

    "title": "Nonlinear and mixed inhibitory effect of matrine on the cytotoxicity of oligomeric amyloid-beta protein.",
    "abstract": "The formation of amyloid beta-protein (1-42) (Abeta42) oligomers and Abeta42 oligomer cytotoxicity are two defining characteristics of the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we found that matrine (Mat) could maintain or even enhance the cytotrophic effect of Abeta42 monomers by inhibiting their aggregation and by working in a manner similar to synergy with Abeta42 monomers. Moreover, Mat could also exert a cytoprotective effect by actively promoting the disaggregation of immature Abeta42 oligomers in a concentration-dependent manner. Although Mat at intermediate concentrations (1-50 muM) exhibited both cytotrophic and cytoprotective effects on SH-SY5Y cells, Mat at higher concentrations (100 muM) only exhibited a cytoprotective effect. Molecular docking studies reveal that these differences are a result of the different interactions between Mat and Abeta42 oligomers that occur at different molecular ratios. Our results support the hypothesis that there may be a Mat-like metabolite in the human brain that acts as a molecular chaperone for Abeta42 monomers. A deficiency in this chaperone would result in the gradual aggregation of Abeta42 monomers, and eventually, formation of toxic Abeta42 oligomers. In addition, reduction or clearance of Abeta42 aggregates or deposits and inhibition or elimination of the toxicity of oligomeric Abeta42, were not always directly correlated. Finally, the site(s) responsible for cytotoxicity in Abeta42 oligomers may be located in the integrated region of the N-terminal fragments of Abeta42 chains. This study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms involved in the development of natural drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a global phenomenon presenting serious social and health challenges. For detecting early molecular changes in the disease, several techniques to measure varied species of amyloid beta in the peripheral blood have been recently developed, but the efforts to associate them with cognitive assessments have yet to produce sufficient data. We prospectively collected participants from the consecutive population who visited our center for brain health screening. In total, 97 participants (F:M = 58:39) aged 69.4 +- 7.52 were assessed. Participants performed the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease (CERAD-K), the clinical dementia rating (CDR), plasma oligomeric amyloid-beta (OAbeta) level tests, routine blood tests, ApoE genotype, and brain MRI. Among total population, 55.7% had a CDR of 0, and 40.2% had a CDR of 0.5. The results showed that word memory and word recall, and the total scores of the CERAD-K were negatively correlated with the plasma OAbeta level. With a cut-off value of 0.78 ng/mL for the OAbeta level and a -1.5 standard deviation of age/sex/education adjusted norms for the CERAD-K; naming, word memory, word recall, word recognition, and total score were significantly correlated with the OAbeta level. No correlation between the OAbeta level and mini-mental status examination was found. Our results demonstrate that the level of plasma OAbeta was well correlated with the measure of cognitive function through the CERAD-K in the field data collected from consecutive populations. Studies on longitudinal comparisons with large cohorts will further validate the diagnostic value of plasma OAbeta as a useful biomarker for screening AD and predicting progression.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been extensively studied as the precursor of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide, the major component of the senile plaques found in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, the function of APP per se in neuronal physiology remains to be fully elucidated. APP is expressed at high levels in the brain. It resembles a cell adhesion molecule or a membrane receptor, suggesting that its function relies on cell-cell interaction and/or activation of intracellular signaling pathways. In this respect, the APP intracellular domain (AICD) was reported to act as a transcriptional regulator. Here, we used a transcriptome-based approach to identify the genes transcriptionally regulated by APP in the rodent embryonic cortex and on maturation of primary cortical neurons. Surprisingly, the overall transcriptional changes were subtle, but a more detailed analysis pointed to genes clustered in neuronal-activity dependent pathways. In particular, we observed a decreased transcription of neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (NPAS4) in APP-/- neurons. NPAS4 is an inducible transcription factor (ITF) regulated by neuronal depolarization. The downregulation of NPAS4 co-occurs with an increased production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and a reduced expression of the GABAA receptors alpha1. CRISPR-Cas-mediated silencing of NPAS4 in neurons led to similar observations. Patch-clamp investigation did not reveal any functional decrease of GABAA receptors activity, but long-term potentiation (LTP) measurement supported an increased GABA component in synaptic transmission of APP-/- mice. Together, NPAS4 appears to be a downstream target involved in APP-dependent regulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission.",

    "title": "A Spectroscopic Marker for Structural Transitions Associated with Amyloid-beta Aggregation.",
    "abstract": "An amyloid aggregate evolves through a series of intermediates that have different secondary structures and intra- and intermolecular contacts. The structural parameters of these intermediates are important determinants of their toxicity. For example, the early oligomeric species of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide have been implicated as the most cytotoxic species in Alzheimer's disease but are difficult to identify because of their dynamic and transitory nature. Conventional aggregation monitors such as the fluorescent dye thioflavin T report on only the overall transition of the soluble species to the final amyloid fibrillar aggregated state. Here, we show that the fluorescent dye bis(triphenylphosphonium) tetraphenylethene (TPE-TPP) identifies at least three distinct aggregation intermediates of Abeta. Some atomic-level features of these intermediates are known from solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Hence, the TPE-TPP fluorescence data may be interpreted in terms of these Abeta structural transitions. Steady state fluorescence and lifetime characteristics of TPE-TPP distinguish between the small oligomeric species (emission wavelength maximum, lambdamax = 465 nm; average fluorescence lifetime, tauFl measured at 420 nm = 3.58 +- 0.04 ns), the intermediate species (lambdamax = 452 nm; tauFl = 3.00 +- 0.03 ns), and the fibrils (lambdamax = 406 nm; tauFl = 5.19 +- 0.08 ns). Thus, TPE-TPP provides a ready diagnostic for differentiating between the various, including the toxic, Abeta aggregates and potentially can be utilized to screen for amyloid aggregation inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "We conducted genome sequencing to search for rare variation contributing to early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Discovery analysis was conducted on 435 cases and 671 controls of European ancestry. Burden testing for rare variation associated with disease was conducted using filters based on variant rarity (less than one in 10,000 or private), computational prediction of deleteriousness (CADD) (10 or 15 thresholds), and molecular function (protein loss-of-function [LoF] only, coding alteration only, or coding plus non-coding variants in experimentally predicted regulatory regions). Replication analysis was conducted on 16,434 independent cases and 15,587 independent controls. Rare variants in TET2 were enriched in the discovery combined EOAD and FTD cohort (p = 4.6 x 10-8, genome-wide corrected p = 0.0026). Most of these variants were canonical LoF or non-coding in predicted regulatory regions. This enrichment replicated across several cohorts of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and FTD (replication only p = 0.0029). The combined analysis odds ratio was 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-3.4) for AD and FTD. The odds ratio for qualifying non-coding variants considered independently from coding variants was 3.7 (95% CI 1.7-9.4). For LoF variants, the combined odds ratio (for AD, FTD, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which shares clinicopathological overlap with FTD) was 3.1 (95% CI 1.9-5.2). TET2 catalyzes DNA demethylation. Given well-defined changes in DNA methylation that occur during aging, rare variation in TET2 may confer risk for neurodegeneration by altering the homeostasis of key aging-related processes. Additionally, our study emphasizes the relevance of non-coding variation in genetic studies of complex disease.",

    "abstract": "With respect to the main role of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques as one of the pathological hallmarks in the brain of Alzheimer's patients, the development of new imaging probes for targeted detection of Abeta plaques has attracted considerable interests. In this study, a novel cyclopentadienyl tricarbonyl Technetium-99 m (99mTc) agent with peptide scaffold, 99mTc-Cp-GABA-D-(FPLIAIMA)-NH2, for binding to the Abeta plaques was designed and successfully synthesized using the Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis method. This radiopeptide revealed a good affinity for Abeta42 aggregations (Kd = 20 microM) in binding affinity study and this result was confirmed by binding to Abeta plaques in brain sections of human Alzheimer's disease (AD) and rat models using in vitro autoradiography, fluorescent staining, and planar scintigraphy. Biodistribution studies of radiopeptide in AD and normal rats demonstrated a moderate initial brain uptake about 0.38 and 0.35% (ID/g) 2 min post-injection, respectively. Whereas, AD rats showed a notable retention time in the brain (0.23% ID/g at 30 min) in comparison with fast clearance in normal rat brains. Normal rats following treatment with cyclosporine A as a p-glycoprotein inhibitor showed a significant increase in the radiopeptide brain accumulation compared to non-treated ones. There was a good correlation between data gathered from single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging and biodistribution studies. Therefore, these findings showed that this novel radiopeptide could be a potential SPECT imaging agent for early detection of Abeta plaques in the brain of patients with AD.",

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence suggests that the dysregulation of neuronal iron may play a critical role in Alzheimer's disease. Recent MRI studies have established a relationship between iron accumulation and amyloid-beta aggregation. The present study provides further insight demonstrating a relationship between iron and tau accumulation using magnetic resonance-based quantitative susceptibility mapping and tau-PET in n = 236 subjects with amyloid-beta pathology (from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 study). Both voxel-wise and regional analyses showed a consistent association between differences in bulk magnetic susceptibility, which can be primarily ascribed to an increase in iron content, and tau-PET signal in regions known to be affected in Alzheimer's disease. Subsequent analyses revealed that quantitative susceptibility specifically mediates the relationship between tau-PET and cortical atrophy measures, thus suggesting a modulatory effect of iron burden on the disease process. We also found evidence suggesting the relationship between quantitative susceptibility and tau-PET is stronger in younger participants (age <= 65). Together, these results provide in vivo evidence of an association between iron deposition and both tau aggregation and neurodegeneration, which help advance our understanding of the role of iron dysregulation in the Alzheimer's disease aetiology.",

    "title": "Reduction of NgR in perforant path decreases amyloid-beta peptide production and ameliorates synaptic and cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyloid beta (Abeta) which is recognized as a main feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been proposed to \"spread\" through anatomically and functionally connected brain regions. The entorhinal cortex and perforant path are the earliest affected brain regions in AD. The perforant path is the most vulnerable circuit in the cortex with respect to both aging and AD. Previous data show that the origins and terminations of the perforant path are susceptible to amyloid deposition at the younger age in AD. Nogo receptor (NgR) plays an essential role in limiting injury-induced axonal growth and experience-dependent plasticity in the adult brain. It has been suggested that NgR is involved in AD pathological features, but the results have been conflicting and the detailed mechanism needs further investigation. In this study, the effect of NgR in the perforant path on the pathological and functional phenotype of APP/PS1 transgenic mice was studied. METHODS: To genetically manipulate NgR expression, adeno-associated virus (AAV) with short hairpin (shRNA) against NgR was injected into the perforant path of APP/PS1 transgenic mice, followed by an assessment of behavioral, synaptic plasticity and neuropathological phenotypes. NgR was overexpressed or knockdown in neuroblastoma N2a cells and APPswe/HEK293 cells to investigate the interaction between NgR and amyloid precursor protein (APP). RESULTS: It is shown that reduction of NgR in the perforant path rescued cognitive and synaptic deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Concurrently, Abeta production in the perforant path and levels of soluble Abeta and amyloid plaques in the hippocampus were significantly decreased. There was a positive correlation between the total APP protein level and NgR expression both in transgenic mice and in cultured cells, where the alpha-secretase and beta-secretase cleavage products both changed with APP level in parallel. Finally, NgR might inhibit APP degradation through lysosome by Rho/Rho-associated protein kinases (ROCK) signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that perforant path NgR plays an important role in regulating APP/Abeta level and cognitive functions in AD transgenic mice, which might be related to the suppression of APP degradation by NgR. Our study suggests that NgR in the perforant path could be a potential target for modulating AD progression.",

We aimed to assess whether blood p-tau181 could be used as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease and for prediction of cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy. METHODS: We developed and validated an ultrasensitive blood immunoassay for p-tau181. Assay performance was evaluated in four clinic-based prospective cohorts. The discovery cohort comprised patients with Alzheimer's disease and age-matched controls. Two validation cohorts (TRIAD and BioFINDER-2) included cognitively unimpaired older adults (mean age 63-69 years), participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease, and frontotemporal dementia. In addition, TRIAD included healthy young adults (mean age 23 years) and BioFINDER-2 included patients with other neurodegenerative disorders. The primary care cohort, which recruited participants in Montreal, Canada, comprised control participants from the community without a diagnosis of a neurological condition and patients referred from primary care physicians of the Canadian National Health Service for specialist care. Concentrations of plasma p-tau181 were compared with established CSF and PET biomarkers and longitudinal measurements using Spearman correlation, area under the curve (AUC), and linear regression analyses. FINDINGS: We studied 37 individuals in the discovery cohort, 226 in the first validation cohort (TRIAD), 763 in the second validation cohort (BioFINDER-2), and 105 in the primary care cohort (n=1131 individuals). In all cohorts, plasma p-tau181 showed gradual increases along the Alzheimer's disease continuum, from the lowest concentrations in amyloid beta-negative young adults and cognitively unimpaired older adults, through higher concentrations in the amyloid beta-positive cognitively unimpaired older adults and MCI groups, to the highest concentrations in the amyloid beta-positive MCI and Alzheimer's disease groups (p<0 001, Alzheimer's disease vs all other groups). Plasma p-tau181 distinguished Alzheimer's disease dementia from amyloid beta-negative young adults (AUC=99 40%) and cognitively unimpaired older adults (AUC=90 21-98 24% across cohorts), as well as other neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal dementia (AUC=82 76-100% across cohorts), vascular dementia (AUC=92 13%), progressive supranuclear palsy or corticobasal syndrome (AUC=88 47%), and Parkinson's disease or multiple systems atrophy (AUC=81 90%). Plasma p-tau181 was associated with PET-measured cerebral tau (AUC=83 08-93 11% across cohorts) and amyloid beta (AUC=76 14-88 09% across cohorts) pathologies, and 1-year cognitive decline (p=0 0015) and hippocampal atrophy (p=0 015). In the primary care cohort, plasma p-tau181 discriminated Alzheimer's disease from young adults (AUC=100%) and cognitively unimpaired older adults (AUC=84 44%), but not from MCI (AUC=55 00%). INTERPRETATION: Blood p-tau181 can predict tau and amyloid beta pathologies, differentiate Alzheimer's disease from other neurodegenerative disorders, and identify Alzheimer's disease across the clinical continuum. Blood p-tau181 could be used as a simple, accessible, and scalable test for screening and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

    "abstract": "Importance: Positron emission tomography (PET) may increase the diagnostic accuracy and confirm the underlying neuropathologic changes of Alzheimer disease (AD). Objective: To determine the accuracy of antemortem [18F]flortaucipir PET images for predicting the presence of AD-type tau pathology at autopsy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This diagnostic study (A16 primary cohort) was conducted from October 2015 to June 2018 at 28 study sites (27 in US sites and 1 in Australia). Individuals with a terminal illness who were older than 50 years and had a projected life expectancy of less than 6 months were enrolled. All participants underwent [18F]flortaucipir PET imaging, and scans were interpreted by 5 independent nuclear medicine physicians or radiologists. Supplemental autopsy [18F]flortaucipir images and pathological samples were also collected from 16 historically collected cases. A second study (FR01 validation study) was conducted from March 26 to April 26, 2019, in which 5 new readers assessed the original PET images for comparison to autopsy. Main Outcomes and Measures: [18F]flortaucipir PET images were visually assessed and compared with immunohistochemical tau pathology. An AD tau pattern of flortaucipir retention was assessed for correspondence with a postmortem B3-level (Braak stage V or VI) pathological pattern of tau accumulation and to the presence of amyloid-beta plaques sufficient to meet the criteria for high levels of AD neuropathological change. Success was defined as having at least 3 of the 5 readers above the lower bounds of the 95% CI for both sensitivity and specificity of 50% or greater. Results: A total of 156 patients were enrolled in the A16 study and underwent [18F]flortaucipir PET imaging. Of these, 73 died during the study, and valid autopsies were performed for 67 of these patients. Three autopsies were evaluated as test cases and removed from the primary cohort (n = 64). Of the 64 primary cohort patients, 34 (53%) were women and 62 (97%) were white; mean (SD) age was 82.5 (9.6) years; and 49 (77%) had dementia, 1 (2%) had mild cognitive impairment, and 14 (22%) had normal cognition. Prespecified success criteria were met for the A16 primary cohort. The flortaucipir PET scans predicted a B3 level of tau pathology, with sensitivity ranging from 92.3% (95% CI, 79.7%-97.3%) to 100.0% (95% CI, 91.0%-100.0%) and specificity ranging from 52.0% (95% CI, 33.5%-70.0%) to 92.0% (95% CI, 75.0%-97.8%). A high level of AD neuropathological change was predicted with sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI, 82.7%-98.5%) to 100.0% (95% CI, 90.8%-100.0%) and specificity of 50.0% (95% CI, 32.1%-67.9%) to 92.3% (95% CI, 75.9%-97.9%). The FR01 validation study also met prespecified success criteria. Addition of the supplemental autopsy data set and 3 test cases, which comprised a total of 82 patients and autopsies for both the A16 and FR01 studies, resulted in improved specificity and comparable overall accuracy. Among the 156 enrolled participants, 14 (9%) experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event. Conclusions and Relevance: This study's findings suggest that PET imaging with [18F]flortaucipir could be used to identify the density and distribution of AD-type tau pathology and the presence of high levels of AD neuropathological change, supporting a neuropathological diagnosis of AD.",

    "abstract": "The microtubule-associated protein Tau is implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Increasing evidence suggests that post-translational modifications play critical roles in regulating Tau's normal functions and its pathogenic properties in tauopathies. Very little is known about how phosphorylation of tyrosine residues influences the structure, aggregation, and microtubule- and lipid-binding properties of Tau. Here, we sought to determine the relative contributions of phosphorylation of one or several of the five tyrosine residues in Tau (Tyr-18, -29, -197, -310, and -394) to the regulation of its biophysical, aggregation, and functional properties. We used a combination of site-specific mutagenesis and in vitro phosphorylation by c-Abl kinase to generate Tau species phosphorylated at all five tyrosine residues, all tyrosine residues except Tyr-310 or Tyr-394 (pTau-Y310F and pTau-Y394F, respectively) and Tau phosphorylated only at Tyr-310 or Tyr-394 (4F/pTyr-310 or 4F/pTyr-394). We observed that phosphorylation of all five tyrosine residues, multiple N-terminal tyrosine residues (Tyr-18, -29, and -197), or specific phosphorylation only at residue Tyr-310 abolishes Tau aggregation and inhibits its microtubule- and lipid-binding properties. NMR experiments indicated that these effects are mediated by a local decrease in beta-sheet propensity of Tau's PHF6 domain. Our findings underscore Tyr-310 phosphorylation has a unique role in the regulation of Tau aggregation, microtubule, and lipid interactions. These results also highlight the importance of conducting further studies to elucidate the role of Tyr-310 in the regulation of Tau's normal functions and pathogenic properties.",

Here we integrate genome-wide association study results with single-cell transcriptomic data from the entire mouse nervous system to systematically identify cell types underlying brain complex traits. We show that psychiatric disorders are predominantly associated with projecting excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Neurological diseases were associated with different cell types, which is consistent with other lines of evidence. Notably, Parkinson's disease was genetically associated not only with cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons (which include dopaminergic neurons) but also with enteric neurons and oligodendrocytes. Using post-mortem brain transcriptomic data, we confirmed alterations in these cells, even at the earliest stages of disease progression. Our study provides an important framework for understanding the cellular basis of complex brain maladies, and reveals an unexpected role of oligodendrocytes in Parkinson's disease.",

The most common pathological hallmark of these age-related neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of specific proteins, including amyloid beta (Abeta), tau, alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43), and repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) peptides, in the intra- and extracellular spaces of selected brain regions. Whereas it remains controversial whether these accumulations are pathogenic or merely a byproduct of disease, the majority of therapeutic research has focused on clearing protein aggregates. Immunotherapies have garnered particular attention for their ability to target specific protein strains and conformations as well as promote clearance. Immunotherapies can also be neuroprotective: by neutralizing extracellular protein aggregates, they reduce spread, synaptic damage, and neuroinflammation. This review will briefly examine the current state of research in immunotherapies against the 3 most commonly targeted proteins for age-related neurodegenerative disease: Abeta, tau, and alpha-syn. The discussion will then turn to combinatorial strategies that enhance the effects of immunotherapy against aggregating protein, followed by new potential targets of immunotherapy such as aging-related processes.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the temporal trajectories of tau and amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by using the longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET) study. METHODS: A total of 132 participants, who were healthy volunteers or recruited in our memory disorder clinic, completed longitudinal 18F-flortaucipir and 18F-florbetaben PET studies with a mean follow-up time of 2 years. Referencing baseline data from 57 Abeta-negative cognitively unimpaired individuals, Z-scores and their annual changes were calculated with the global cortical or regional standardized uptake value ratios measured at baseline and follow-up after correcting for partial volume effect. The temporal trajectories of tau and Abeta burden as a function of time were obtained based on the spline models from the annual changes and baseline Z-score data. RESULTS: Tau burden first emerged in the Braak's stage I-II regions, followed by stage III-IV regions, and finally in the stage V-VI regions. Time intervals between two time points at which Z-score curves rose above 2 were 17.3 years for the stages I-II and III-IV and 15.2 years for the stages III-IV and V-VI. Rise in the tau curve for stages I-II preceded that for global cortical Abeta, while the rise in global cortical Abeta curve preceded that for global cortical tau. Abeta accumulation rate was attenuated during the surge in tau burden in the global cortex and reached a plateau. CONCLUSION: Sequential appearance of Abeta and tau accumulation supports a hypothetical dynamic biomarker model and Braak's hierarchical tau spreading model in AD.",

    "title": "Identification of novel candidate autoantibodies in Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Accumulated failures in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials have highlighted an urgent need to identify additional biomarkers involved in AD. Recently, mounting evidence reported that autoantibodies are ubiquitous in human sera. However, it is unknown whether autoantibodies are upregulated in amyloid-tau biomarker-confirmed AD. METHODS: A total of 40 subjects with mild dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating = 1) were stratified into AD (n = 16) and non-AD (n = 24) groups according to their cerebrospinal fluid levels of tau and Abeta42 . Their sera were collected and analyzed using a microarray containing > 1600 potential human autoantigens. Autoantibodies that were present exclusively in the AD group were identified and selected using the penetrance-based fold change method with the following criteria: penetrance fold change(AD)  >= 2, frequency(AD)  >= 15% and frequency(non-AD)  = 0%. RESULTS: All controls and samples passed the quality control criteria and were further used for biomarker analysis. Six autoantibodies with elevated responses to the following autoantigens were found exclusively in the AD group: nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 3 (31.3%, 5/16 subjects) and microtubule-associated protein 4, pantothenic acid kinase 3, phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1, protein tyrosine phosphatase type IVA member 1 and SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 15 (all 18.8%, 3/16 subjects). CONCLUSIONS: Although some identified autoantigens are linked to AD and cognitive dysfunction, the increased autoantibody levels have not been reported in AD. Autoantibodies may provide deeper insights into the pathogenesis of AD and serve as diagnostic biomarkers; their corresponding antigens can be further studied to assess their potential as therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "It was hypothesized that the brain beta-amyloid buildup curve plateaus at an early symptomatic stage of Alzheimer disease (AD). Atrophy-related partial-volume effects (PVEs) degrade signal in hot-spot imaging techniques such as amyloid PET. The current study, a longitudinal analysis of amyloid-sensitive PET data, investigated the effect on the shape of the beta-amyloid curve in AD when PVE correction (PVEC) is applied. Methods: We analyzed baseline and 2-y follow-up data for 216 symptomatic individuals on the AD continuum (positive amyloid status) enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (17 with AD dementia and 199 with mild cognitive impairment), including 18F-florbetapir PET, MRI, and Mini Mental State Examination scores. For PVEC, the modified Muller-Gartner method was performed. Results: Compared with non-PVE-corrected data, PVE-corrected data yielded significantly higher changes in regional and composite SUV ratio (SUVR) over time (P = 0.0002 for composite SUVRs). Longitudinal SUVR changes in relation to Mini Mental State Examination decreases showed a significantly higher slope for the regression line in the PVE-corrected than in the non-PVE-corrected PET data (F 1 = 7.1, P = 0.008). Conclusion: These PVEC results indicate that the beta-amyloid buildup curve does not plateau at an early symptomatic disease stage. A further evaluation of the impact of PVEC on the in vivo characterization of time-dependent AD pathology, including the reliable assessment and comparison of other amyloid tracers, is warranted.",

Amyloid beta (Abeta) causes cytosolic Ca2+ overload, but the effects of Abeta on mitochondrial Ca2+ levels in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain unclear. Using a ratiometric Ca2+ indicator targeted to neuronal mitochondria and intravital multiphoton microscopy, we find increased mitochondrial Ca2+ levels associated with plaque deposition and neuronal death in a transgenic mouse model of cerebral beta-amyloidosis. Naturally secreted soluble Abeta applied onto the healthy brain increases Ca2+ concentration in mitochondria, which is prevented by blockage of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter. RNA-sequencing from post-mortem AD human brains shows downregulation in the expression of mitochondrial influx Ca2+ transporter genes, but upregulation in the genes related to mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux pathways, suggesting a counteracting effect to avoid Ca2+ overload. We propose lowering neuronal mitochondrial Ca2+ by inhibiting the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter as a novel potential therapeutic target against AD.",

An ultra-high-sensitive assay is needed for detecting AbetapE3-40. Methods: Immunomagnetic reduction was used for quantification of AbetapE3-40 in plasma from 46 participants. The concentrations of AbetapE3-40 of these subjects were compared with 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) images. Results: AbetapE3-40 concentration was 44.1 +- 28.2 fg/mL in PET- (n = 28) and 91.6 +- 54.6 fg/mL in PET+ (n = 18; P < .05). The cutoff value of AbetapE3-40 for discriminating PET- from PET+ was 55.5 fg/mL, resulting in a sensitivity of 83.3%, a specificity of 71.4%. The concentration of AbetapE3-40 showed a moderate correlation (r = 0.437) with PET standardized uptake value ratio. Discussion: We did not enroll pre-clinical AD subject with normal cognition but Abeta PET+. It would be an important issue to explore the feasibility of using AbetapE3-40 for screening pre-clinical subjects. Conclusion: These results reveal the feasibility of detecting Abeta pathology using quantification of a plaque-derived Abeta molecule in plasma.",

    "abstract": "The abnormal accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregates in the brain is a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. We report a near-infrared (NIR)-active CuBi2O4-based photocathodic platform that can target intact Abeta aggregates and dissociate them into nontoxic species. Because of its relatively narrow band gap, CuBi2O4 exhibits strong absorption of NIR light, which allows for deeper tissue penetration and causes less photodamage to tissues compared to visible light. Furthermore, its high stability in aqueous media, biocompatibility, and robustness against photocorrosion make CuBi2O4 an ideal material for medical applications. For the targeted clearance of Abeta aggregates, we have conjugated the KLVFF peptide which specifically recognizes and captures Abeta aggregates on the surface of silver-doped CuBi2O4 (Ag:CuBi2O4). Upon illumination of NIR light under a cathodic bias, the KLVFF-immobilized Ag:CuBi2O4 (KLVFF-Ag:CuBi2O4) effectively dissociated beta-sheet-rich, long, and entangled Abeta fibrillary aggregates into small fragmented, soluble species through photo-oxygenation. We also verified that the KLVFF-Ag:CuBi2O4 photocathode is biocompatible and effective in reducing Abeta aggregate-induced neurotoxicity. Our work demonstrates the potential of the KLVFF-Ag:CuBi2O4 platform for the targeted disassembly of cytotoxic, robust Abeta aggregates with the aid of NIR energy and cathodic bias.",

The three palladium(II) complexes 1-3 were prepared respectively from HL1, HL2, and HL3. The crystal structures of two coordination compounds, namely Pd(L2)2 (2) and Pd(L3)2 (3), were obtained, which showed the expected square-planar environment for the metal centers. The ligand HL3 and the Pd(II) complexes 1-3, which are stable in buffered solutions containing up to 5% DMSO, exhibit remarkable inhibitory properties against the aggregation of amyloid-beta, reducing the formation of fibrils. HL1, HL3, 2, and 3 display IC50 values (i.e., the concentrations required to reduce Abeta fibrillation by 50%) below 1 muM, lower that of the reference compound catechin (IC50 = 2.8 muM). Finally, in cellulo studies with E. coli cells revealed that the palladium(II) compounds are significantly more efficient than the free ligands in inhibiting Abeta aggregation inside bacterial inclusion bodies, thus illustrating a beneficial effect of metal coordination.",

    "title": "A new tetra-plex fluorimetric assay for the quantification of cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid42, total-tau, phospho-tau and alpha-synuclein in the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementia.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementia is currently supported by biomarkers including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests. Among them, CSF total-tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and beta-amyloid42 (Abeta42) are considered core biomarkers of neurodegeneration. In the present work, we hypothesize that simultaneous assessment of these biomarkers together with CSF alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) will significantly improve the differential diagnostic of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. To that aim, we characterized the analytical and clinical performance of a new tetra-plex immunoassay that simultaneously quantifies CSF Abeta42, t-tau, p-tau and alpha-syn in the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementia. METHODS: Biomarkers' concentrations were measured in neurological controls (n = 38), Alzheimer's disease (n = 35), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (n = 37), vascular dementia (n = 28), dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson's disease dementia (n = 27) and frontotemporal dementia (n = 34) using the new tetra-plex assay and established single-plex assays. Biomarker's performance was evaluated and diagnostic accuracy in the discrimination of diagnostic groups was determined using partial least squares discriminant analysis. RESULTS: The tetra-plex assay presented accuracies similar to individual single-plex assays with acceptable analytical performance. Significant correlations were observed between tetra-plex and single-plex assays. Using partial least squares discriminant analysis, Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were well differentiated, reaching high accuracies in the discrimination from the rest of diagnostic groups. CONCLUSIONS: The new tetra-plex assay coupled with multivariate analytical approaches becomes a valuable asset for the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementia and related applications.",

    "title": "Copper stabilizes antiparallel beta-sheet fibrils of the amyloid beta40 (Abeta40)-Iowa variant.",
    "abstract": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a vascular disorder that primarily involves deposition of the 40-residue-long beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta40) in and along small blood vessels of the brain. CAA is often associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by amyloid plaques in the brain parenchyma enriched in the Abeta42 peptide. Several recent studies have suggested a structural origin that underlies the differences between the vascular amyloid deposits in CAA and the parenchymal plaques in AD. We previously have found that amyloid fibrils in vascular amyloid contain antiparallel beta-sheet, whereas previous studies by other researchers have reported parallel beta-sheet in fibrils from parenchymal amyloid. Using X-ray fluorescence microscopy, here we found that copper strongly co-localizes with vascular amyloid in human sporadic CAA and familial Iowa-type CAA brains compared with control brain blood vessels lacking amyloid deposits. We show that binding of Cu(II) ions to antiparallel fibrils can block the conversion of these fibrils to the more stable parallel, in-register conformation and enhances their ability to serve as templates for seeded growth. These results provide an explanation for how thermodynamically less stable antiparallel fibrils may form amyloid in or on cerebral vessels by using Cu(II) as a structural cofactor.",

    "title": "APOE4 leads to blood-brain barrier dysfunction predicting cognitive decline.",
    "abstract": "Vascular contributions to dementia and Alzheimer's disease are increasingly recognized1-6. Recent studies have suggested that breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an early biomarker of human cognitive dysfunction7, including the early clinical stages of Alzheimer's disease5,8-10. The E4 variant of apolipoprotein E (APOE4), the main susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease11-14, leads to accelerated breakdown of the BBB and degeneration of brain capillary pericytes15-19, which maintain BBB integrity20-22. It is unclear, however, whether the cerebrovascular effects of APOE4 contribute to cognitive impairment. Here we show that individuals bearing APOE4 (with the epsilon3/epsilon4 or epsilon4/epsilon4 alleles) are distinguished from those without APOE4 (epsilon3/epsilon3) by breakdown of the BBB in the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe. This finding is apparent in cognitively unimpaired APOE4 carriers and more severe in those with cognitive impairment, but is not related to amyloid-beta or tau pathology measured in cerebrospinal fluid or by positron emission tomography23. High baseline levels of the BBB pericyte injury biomarker soluble PDGFRbeta7,8 in the cerebrospinal fluid predicted future cognitive decline in APOE4 carriers but not in non-carriers, even after controlling for amyloid-beta and tau status, and were correlated with increased activity of the BBB-degrading cyclophilin A-matrix metalloproteinase-9 pathway19 in cerebrospinal fluid. Our findings suggest that breakdown of the BBB contributes to APOE4-associated cognitive decline independently of Alzheimer's disease pathology, and might be a therapeutic target in APOE4 carriers.",

    "abstract": "Tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration are key aspects of Alzheimer's disease. Understanding whether these features predict cognitive decline, alone or in combination, is crucial to develop new prognostic measures and enhanced stratification for clinical trials. Here, we studied how baseline assessments of in vivo tau pathology (measured by 18F-AV-1451 PET), neuroinflammation (measured by 11C-PK11195 PET) and brain atrophy (derived from structural MRI) predicted longitudinal cognitive changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease pathology. Twenty-six patients (n = 12 with clinically probable Alzheimer's dementia and n = 14 with amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment) and 29 healthy control subjects underwent baseline assessment with 18F-AV-1451 PET, 11C-PK11195 PET, and structural MRI. Cognition was examined annually over the subsequent 3 years using the revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination. Regional grey matter volumes, and regional binding of 18F-AV-1451 and 11C-PK11195 were derived from 15 temporo-parietal regions characteristically affected by Alzheimer's disease pathology. A principal component analysis was used on each imaging modality separately, to identify the main spatial distributions of pathology. A latent growth curve model was applied across the whole sample on longitudinal cognitive scores to estimate the rate of annual decline in each participant. We regressed the individuals' estimated rate of cognitive decline on the neuroimaging components and examined univariable predictive models with single-modality predictors, and a multi-modality predictive model, to identify the independent and combined prognostic value of the different neuroimaging markers. Principal component analysis identified a single component for the grey matter atrophy, while two components were found for each PET ligand: one weighted to the anterior temporal lobe, and another weighted to posterior temporo-parietal regions. Across the whole-sample, the single-modality models indicated significant correlations between the rate of cognitive decline and the first component of each imaging modality. In patients, both stepwise backward elimination and Bayesian model selection revealed an optimal predictive model that included both components of 18F-AV-1451 and the first (i.e. anterior temporal) component for 11C-PK11195. However, the MRI-derived atrophy component and demographic variables were excluded from the optimal predictive model of cognitive decline. We conclude that temporo-parietal tau pathology and anterior temporal neuroinflammation predict cognitive decline in patients with symptomatic Alzheimer's disease pathology. This indicates the added value of PET biomarkers in predicting cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, over and above MRI measures of brain atrophy and demographic data. Our findings also support the strategy for targeting tau and neuroinflammation in disease-modifying therapy against Alzheimer's disease.",

Nasal administration of APP1 and Tau1 mixture, three times a week for four or five months, reduced amyloid plaque burden as well as the level of soluble Abeta 1-42 in the brain.

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction has long been implicated in the neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson's disease (PD); however, it is unclear how mitochondrial impairment and alpha-synuclein pathology are coupled. Using specific mitochondrial inhibitors, EM analysis, and biochemical assays, we report here that intramitochondrial protein homeostasis plays a major role in alpha-synuclein aggregation. We found that interference with intramitochondrial proteases, such as HtrA2 and Lon protease, and mitochondrial protein import significantly aggravates alpha-synuclein seeding. In contrast, direct inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, or formation of reactive oxygen species, all of which have been associated with mitochondrial stress, did not affect alpha-synuclein pathology. We further demonstrate that similar mechanisms are involved in amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta42) aggregation. Our results suggest that, in addition to other protein quality control pathways, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system, mitochondria per se can influence protein homeostasis of cytosolic aggregation-prone proteins. We propose that approaches that seek to maintain mitochondrial fitness, rather than target downstream mitochondrial dysfunction, may aid in the search for therapeutic strategies to manage PD and related neuropathologies.",

    "abstract": "Familial Alzheimer disease-causing mutations in Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) are generally thought to shift the processing of APP toward longer, more amyloidogenic Abeta fragments. However, certain PSEN1 mutations cause severe reduction in gamma secretase function when expressed in the homozygous state, thus challenging the amyloid hypothesis. We sought to evaluate the effects of one such mutation, PSEN1 L435F, in more physiologic conditions and genetic contexts by using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from an individual with familial AD (fAD) linked to the PSEN1 L435F mutation, and compared the biochemical phenotype of the iPS-derived neurons with brain tissue obtained at autopsy from the same patient. Our results demonstrate that in the endogenous heterozygous state, the PSEN1 L435F mutation causes a large increase in soluble Abeta43 but does not change the overall levels of soluble Abeta40 or Abeta42 when compared with control iPSC-neurons. Increased pathologically phosphorylated tau species were also observed in PSEN1-mutant iPSC-neurons. Concordant changes in Abeta species were present in autopsy brain tissue from the same patient. Finally, the feasibility of using Abeta43 immunohistochemistry of brain tissue to identify fAD cases was evaluated in a limited autopsy case series with the finding that strong Abeta43 staining occurred only in fAD cases.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta1-42), total tau protein (t-Tau), and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) are ATN biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and reflect pathogenic changes in the brain. CSF biomarkers of AD are considered for inclusion in the diagnostic criteria for research and clinical purposes to reduce the uncertainty of clinical diagnosis and to distinguish among AD stages. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare two commercially available analytical platforms with respect to accuracy and the potential for early diagnosis of AD. METHODS: A total of 211 CSF samples from healthy control (HC) and AD subjects were analyzed using two analytical platforms, INNOTEST ELISA and INNOBIA AlzBio3 xMAP kits. The accuracy of diagnosis and AUC values distinguishing study groups were compared between the two analytical platforms. RESULTS: The absolute values for Abeta1-42, t-Tau, and p-Tau181 levels differed between the two platforms. The Abeta1-42 levels decreased, while t-Tau and p-Tau levels increased according to the AD stages. The AUC of Abeta1-42 and t-Tau, which distinguish the early stages of AD (preclinical and prodromal AD), were similar between the two platforms, whereas there were significant differences in p-Tau AUC values. CSF p-Tau using the INNOBIA was highly accurate for distinguishing both preclinical AD (AUC = 0.826, cut-off score>=38.89) and prodromal AD (AUC = 0.862, cut-off score>=41.88) from HC. CONCLUSION: The accuracy of CSF p-Tau levels in the preclinical and prodromal AD is higher for the INNOBIA than the INNOTEST, and the early stage AD can be accurately distinguished from HC.",

Despite major research efforts, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker profiles of the two diseases are still not known in detail. OBJECTIVE: To determine if novel CSF biomarkers, neurofilament light (NFL) reflecting axonal damage, the synaptic protein neurogranin (NG), and the astroglial marker chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), and the core Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers, amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42), total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), can differentiate iNPH from SIVD. Patients with AD and healthy controls (HC) were included for comparison purposes. METHODS: Patients with iNPH (n = 28), SIVD (n = 30), AD (n = 57), and HC (n = 33) were retrospectively included from the Danish Dementia Biobank. All patients with iNPH had effect of shunt surgery with a follow-up period of 4 to 69 months. CSF biomarkers were measured using immunoassays. RESULTS: Lower levels of NFL, NG, Abeta42, and t-tau were found in patients with iNPH versus SIVD, while YKL-40 and p-tau were similar in the two diseases. NFL and Abeta42 were the most reliable biomarkers to differentiate iNPH from SIVD with an area under the curve (AUC) on 0.82 and 0.80, respectively. Combining NFL with Abeta42, t-tau, and p-tau resulted in an AUC of 0.90, which was equivalent to the diagnostic accuracy of all six biomarkers combined. CONCLUSION: An addition of NFL to the CSF panel of Abeta42, t-tau, and p-tau may improve the differentiation of iNPH from SIVD.",

    "abstract": "Importance: The diagnostic performance of second-generation tau positron emission tomographic (PET) tracers is not yet known. Objective: To examine the novel tau PET tracer RO948 F 18 ([18F]RO948) performance in discriminating Alzheimer disease (AD) from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this diagnostic study, 613 participants in the Swedish BioFINDER-2 study were consecutively enrolled in a prospective cross-sectional study from September 4, 2017, to August 28, 2019. Participants included 257 cognitively unimpaired controls, 154 patients with mild cognitive impairment, 100 patients with AD dementia, and 102 with non-AD neurodegenerative disorders. Evaluation included a comparison of tau PET tracer [18F]RO948 with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid and a head-to-head comparison between [18F]RO948 and flortaucipir F 18 ([18F]flortaucipir) in patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). Exposures: [18F]RO948 (all patients) and [18F]flortaucipir (3 patients with svPPA) tau PET; MRI (hippocampal volume, composite temporal lobe cortical thickness, whole-brain cortical thickness) and cerebrospinal fluid measures (p-tau181 and amyloid Abeta42 and Abeta40 ratio[Abeta42/Abeta40], and Abeta42/p-tau181 ratio). Main Outcomes and Measures: Standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) in 4 predefined regions of interest (ROIs) reflecting Braak staging scheme for tau pathology and encompass I-II (entorhinal cortex), III-IV (inferior/middle temporal, fusiform gyrus, parahippocampal cortex, and amygdala), I-IV, and V-VI (widespread neocortical areas), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values, and subtraction images between [18F]RO948 and [18F]flortaucipir. Results: Diagnostic groups among the 613 participants included cognitively unimpaired (mean [SD] age, 65.8 [12.1] years; 117 men [46%]), mild cognitive impairment (age, 70.8 [8.3] years; 82 men [53%]), AD dementia (age, 73.5 [6.7] years; 57 men [57%]), and non-AD disorders (age, 70.5 [8.6] years; 41 men [40%]). Retention of [18F]RO948 was higher in AD dementia compared with all other diagnostic groups. [18F]RO948 could distinguish patients with AD dementia from individuals without cognitive impairment and those with non-AD disorders, and the highest AUC was obtained using the I-IV ROI (AUC = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99 for AD vs no cognitive impairment and AUC = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99 for AD vs non-AD disorders), which outperformed MRI (highest AUC = 0.91 for AD vs no cognitive impairment using whole-brain thickness, and AUC = 0.80 for AD vs non-AD disorders using temporal lobe thickness) and cerebrospinal fluid measures (highest AUC = 0.94 for AD vs no cognitive impairment using Abeta42/p-tau181, and AUC = 0.93 for AD vs non-AD disorders using Abeta42/Abeta40). Generally, tau PET positivity using [18F]RO948 was observed only in Abeta-positive cases or in MAPT R406W mutation carriers. Retention of [18F]RO948 was not pronounced in patients with svPPA, and head-to-head comparison revealed lower temporal lobe uptake than with [18F]flortaucipir. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, elevated [18F]RO948 SUVRs were most often seen among Abeta-positive cases, which suggests that [18F]RO948 has high specificity for AD-type tau and highlights its potential as a diagnostic marker in the differential diagnosis of AD.",

    "abstract": "The brain's complex microconnectivity underlies its computational abilities and vulnerability to injury and disease. It has been challenging to illuminate the features of this synaptic network due to the small size and dense packing of its elements. Here, we describe a rapid, accessible super-resolution imaging and analysis workflow-SEQUIN-that quantifies central synapses in human tissue and animal models, characterizes their nanostructural and molecular features, and enables volumetric imaging of mesoscale synaptic networks without the production of large histological arrays. Using SEQUIN, we identify cortical synapse loss resulting from diffuse traumatic brain injury, a highly prevalent connectional disorder. Similar synapse loss is observed in three murine models of Alzheimer-related neurodegeneration, where SEQUIN mesoscale mapping identifies regional synaptic vulnerability. These results establish an easily implemented and robust nano-to-mesoscale synapse quantification and characterization method. They furthermore identify a shared mechanism-synaptopathy-between Alzheimer neurodegeneration and its best-established epigenetic risk factor, brain trauma.",

    "title": "The implications of different approaches to define AT(N) in Alzheimer disease.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare different beta-amyloid (Abeta), tau, and neurodegeneration (AT[N]) variants within the Swedish BioFINDER studies. METHODS: A total of 490 participants were classified into AT(N) groups. These include 53 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 48 cognitively impaired (CI) participants (14 mild cognitive impairment [MCI] and 34 Alzheimer disease [AD] dementia) from BioFINDER-1 and 389 participants from BioFINDER-2 (245 CU and 144 CI [138 MCI and 6 AD dementia]). Biomarkers for A were CSF Abeta42 and amyloid-PET ([18F]flutemetamol); for T, CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and tau PET ([18F]flortaucipir); and for (N), hippocampal volume, temporal cortical thickness, and CSF neurofilament light (NfL). Binarization of biomarkers was achieved using cutoffs defined in other cohorts. The relationship between different AT(N) combinations and cognitive trajectories (longitudinal Mini-Mental State Examination scores) was examined using linear mixed modeling and coefficient of variation. RESULTS: Among CU participants, A-T-(N)- or A+T-(N)- variants were most common. However, more T+ cases were seen using p-tau than tau PET. Among CI participants, A+T+(N)+ was more common; however, more (N)+ cases were seen for MRI measures relative to CSF NfL. Tau PET best predicted longitudinal cognitive decline in CI and p-tau in CU participants. Among CI participants, continuous T (especially tau PET) and (N) measures improved the prediction of cognitive decline compared to binary measures. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that different AT(N) variants are not interchangeable, and that optimal variants differ by clinical stage. In some cases, dichotomizing biomarkers may result in loss of important prognostic information.",

Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) has emerged as a promising biomarker of synaptic density. METHODS: We measured SV2A binding in 34 participants with early AD and 19 cognitively normal (CN) participants using [11 C]UCB-J PET and a cerebellar reference region for calculation of the distribution volume ratio. RESULTS: We observed widespread reductions of SV2A binding in medial temporal and neocortical brain regions in early AD compared to CN participants. These reductions were largely maintained after correction for volume loss and were more extensive than decreases in gray matter volume. CONCLUSION: We were able to measure widespread synaptic loss due to AD using [11 C]UCB-J PET. Future studies will continue to evaluate the utility of SV2A PET for tracking AD progression and for monitoring potential therapies.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurological brain disorder. AD pathophysiology is mainly represented by formation of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Neuritic plaques are made up of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, which play a central role in AD pathogenesis. In AD brain, Abeta peptide accumulates due to overproduction, insufficient clearance and defective proteolytic degradation. The degradation and cleavage mechanism of Abeta peptides by several human enzymes have been discussed previously. In the mean time, numerous experimental and bioinformatics reports indicated the significance of microbial enzymes having potential to degrade Abeta peptides. Thus, there is a need to shift the focus toward the substrate specificity and structure-function relationship of Abeta peptide-degrading microbial enzymes. Hence, in this review, we discussed in vitro and in silico studies of microbial enzymes viz. cysteine protease and zinc metallopeptidases having ability to degrade Abeta peptides. In silico study showed that cysteine protease can cleave Abeta peptide between Lys16-Cys17; similarly, several other enzymes also showed capability to degrade Abeta peptide at different sites. Thus, this review paves the way to explore the role of microbial enzymes in Abeta peptide degradation and to design new lead compounds for AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection elicits the production of cytotoxic amyloids from lung endothelium, yet molecular mechanisms of host-pathogen interaction that underlie the amyloid production are not well understood. We examined the importance of type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors in the production of cytotoxic amyloids. P aeruginosa possessing a functional T3SS and effectors induced the production and release of cytotoxic amyloids from lung endothelium, including beta amyloid, and tau. T3SS effector intoxication was sufficient to generate cytotoxic amyloid release, yet intoxication with exoenzyme Y (ExoY) alone or together with exoenzymes S and T (ExoS/T/Y) generated the most virulent amyloids. Infection with lab and clinical strains engendered cytotoxic amyloids that were capable of being propagated in endothelial cell culture and passed to naive cells, indicative of a prion strain. Conversely, T3SS-incompetent P aeruginosa infection produced non-cytotoxic amyloids with antimicrobial properties. These findings provide evidence that (1) endothelial intoxication with ExoY is sufficient to elicit self-propagating amyloid cytotoxins during infection, (2) pulmonary endothelium contributes to innate immunity by generating antimicrobial amyloids in response to bacterial infection, and (3) ExoY contributes to the virulence arsenal of P aeruginosa through the subversion of endothelial amyloid host-defense to promote a lung endothelial-derived cytotoxic proteinopathy.",

    "abstract": "Asymmetries of amyloid-beta (Abeta) burden are well known in Alzheimer disease (AD) but did not receive attention in Abeta mouse models of Alzheimer disease. Therefore, we investigated Abeta asymmetries in Abeta mouse models examined by Abeta small-animal PET and tested if such asymmetries have an association with microglial activation. Methods: We analyzed 523 cross-sectional Abeta PET scans of 5 different Abeta mouse models (APP/PS1, PS2APP, APP-SL70, App NL-G-F , and APPswe) together with 136 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) PET scans for microglial activation. The asymmetry index (AI) was calculated between tracer uptake in both hemispheres. AIs of Abeta PET were analyzed in correlation with TSPO PET AIs. Extrapolated required sample sizes were compared between analyses of single and combined hemispheres. Results: Relevant asymmetries of Abeta deposition were identified in at least 30% of all investigated mice. There was a significant correlation between AIs of Abeta PET and TSPO PET in 4 investigated Abeta mouse models (APP/PS1: R = 0.593, P = 0.001; PS2APP: R = 0.485, P = 0.019; APP-SL70: R = 0.410, P = 0.037; App NL-G-F : R = 0.385, P = 0.002). Asymmetry was associated with higher variance of tracer uptake in single hemispheres, leading to higher required sample sizes. Conclusion: Asymmetry of fibrillar plaque neuropathology occurs frequently in Abeta mouse models and acts as a potential confounder in experimental designs. Concomitant asymmetry of microglial activation indicates a neuroinflammatory component to hemispheric predominance of fibrillary amyloidosis.",

Some studies showed that chrysin has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, your bioavailability is relatively low. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the effects of chrysin loaded lipid-core nanocapsules (LNCs) on neurochemical and behavioral changes in a model of AD induced by beta-amyloid1-42 (Abeta1-42) peptide in aged female mice. For this purpose, aged female mice received free chrysin (FC) (5 mg/kg, per oral, p.o.) or chrysin loaded LNCs (C1-LNC and C5-LNC) (1 or 5 mg/kg, p.o.) for 14 days after Abeta1-42 administration (400 pmol, i.c.v.). Abeta1-42 induced significant impairments on memory and learning (morris water maze task, object recognition and step-down-type passive avoidance), also caused oxidative stress, reduced the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), increased neuroinflammation in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of aged animals. Thus, C1-LNC and C5-LNC displayed significant effect against Abeta1-42, via attenuation of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, modulation of neurochemical and behavioral changes in a model of AD. These results point to chrysin loaded LNCs (mainly C5-LNC) can be a promising biomedical tool and a new therapeutic approach for treatment and prevention of AD.",

    "abstract": "Small heat-shock proteins (sHSPs) are ubiquitously expressed molecular chaperones that inhibit amyloid fibril formation; however, their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. sHSPs comprise a conserved alpha-crystallin domain flanked by variable N- and C-terminal regions. To investigate the functional contributions of these three regions, we compared the chaperone activities of various constructs of human alphaB-crystallin (HSPB5) and heat-shock 27-kDa protein (Hsp27, HSPB1) during amyloid formation by alpha-synuclein and apolipoprotein C-II. Using an array of approaches, including thioflavin T fluorescence assays and sedimentation analysis, we found that the N-terminal region of Hsp27 and the terminal regions of alphaB-crystallin are important for delaying amyloid fibril nucleation and for disaggregating mature apolipoprotein C-II fibrils. We further show that the terminal regions are required for stable fibril binding by both sHSPs and for mediating lateral fibril-fibril association, which sequesters preformed fibrils into large aggregates and is believed to have a cytoprotective function. We conclude that although the isolated alpha-crystallin domain retains some chaperone activity against amyloid formation, the flanking domains contribute additional and important chaperone activities, both in delaying amyloid formation and in mediating interactions of sHSPs with amyloid aggregates. Both these chaperone activities have significant implications for the pathogenesis and progression of diseases associated with amyloid deposition, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.",

CSF P-tau and T-tau started to increase before the threshold for Amyloid PET positivity, while Tau PET started to increase after Amyloid PET positivity. Effects of Amyloid PET on Tau PET were mediated by CSF P-tau, and high CSF P-tau predicted increased Tau PET rates. Individuals with MAPT mutations and signs of tau deposition (but without Abeta pathology) had normal CSF P-tau levels. In 5xFAD mice, CSF tau increased when Abeta aggregation started.

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta peptide (Abeta42) aggregation in the brain is thought to be responsible for the onset of Alzheimer's disease, an insidious condition without an effective treatment or cure. Hence, a strategy to prevent aggregation and subsequent toxicity is crucial. Bio-inspired peptide-based molecules are ideal candidates for the inhibition of Abeta42 aggregation, and are currently deemed to be a promising option for drug design. In this study, a hexapeptide containing a self-recognition component unique to Abeta42 was designed to mimic the beta-strand hydrophobic core region of the Abeta peptide. The peptide is comprised exclusively of D-amino acids to enhance specificity towards Abeta42, in conjunction with a C-terminal disruption element to block the recruitment of Abeta42 monomers on to fibrils. The peptide was rationally designed to exploit the synergy between the recognition and disruption components, and incorporates features such as hydrophobicity, beta-sheet propensity, and charge, that all play a critical role in the aggregation process. Fluorescence assays, native ion-mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) and cell viability assays were used to demonstrate that the peptide interacts with Abeta42 monomers and oligomers with high specificity, leading to almost complete inhibition of fibril formation, with essentially no cytotoxic effects. These data define the peptide-based inhibitor as a potentially potent anti-amyloid drug candidate for this hitherto incurable disease.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid fibril formation is a hallmark of diverse neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Conventional diagnosis is based on the appearance of fibrils or plaques, while neglects the role of early-stage oligomers in the disease progression. Recent studies have uncovered that it is the early-stage oligomer, rather than the mature fibril, that greatly contributes cytotoxicity. The formation of oligomers involves complicate structural conversions and it is essential to investigate their conformational changes for a better understanding of aggregation mechanism. The coexistence of soluble early-stage oligomers, intermediates, and pre-fibril species makes it difficult to be differentiate by morphological methods, and only average structural information is provided as they lack the ability of separation. Therefore, mass spectrometry (MS) becomes an alternative technique that presents new and complementary insights into the onset of amyloid fibrils. This review highlights the hotspots and important achievements by MS in the field of amyloid formation mechanism, including the direct detection and differentiation of soluble oligomers (native MS), unambiguous identification of interacted sites involved in the onset of aggregation [hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) and chemical cross-linking (CX)], and conformational switch that leads to fibrilization [collision cross section (CCS) regularity by ion mobility (IM)].",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive disturbance as a consequence of the loss of cholinergic neurons in the brain, neuritic plaques and hyperphosphorylation of TAU protein. Although the underlying mechanisms leading to these events are unclear, mutations in presenilin 1 (PSEN1), e.g., E280A (PSEN1 E280A), are causative factors for autosomal dominant early-onset familial AD (FAD). Despite advances in the understanding of the physiopathology of AD, there are no efficient therapies to date. Limitations in culturing brain-derived live neurons might explain the limited effectiveness of AD research. Here, we show that mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) can be used to model FAD, providing novel opportunities to study cellular mechanisms and to establish therapeutic strategies. Indeed, we cultured MSCs with the FAD mutation PSEN1 E280A and wild-type (WT) PSEN1 from umbilical cords and characterized the transdifferentiation of these cells into cholinergic-like neurons (ChLNs). PSEN1 E280A ChLNs but not WT PSEN1 ChLNs exhibited increased intracellular soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPPf) fragments and extracellular Abeta42 peptide and TAU phosphorylation (at residues Ser202/Thr205), recapitulating the molecular pathogenesis of FAD caused by mutant PSEN1. Furthermore, PSEN1 E280A ChLNs presented oxidative stress (OS) as evidenced by the oxidation of DJ-1Cys106-SH into DJ-1Cys106-SO3 and the detection of DCF-positive cells and apoptosis markers such as activated pro-apoptosis proteins p53, c-JUN, PUMA and CASPASE-3 and the concomitant loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and DNA fragmentation. Additionally, mutant ChLNs displayed Ca2+ flux dysregulation and deficient acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity compared to control ChLNs. Interestingly, the inhibitor JNK SP600125 almost completely blocked TAU phosphorylation. Our findings demonstrate that FAD MSC-derived cholinergic neurons with the PSEN1 E280A mutation provide important clues for the identification of targetable pathological molecules.",

    "abstract": "The nucleation of Alzheimer-associated Abeta peptide monomers can be catalyzed by preexisting Abeta fibrils. This leads to autocatalytic amplification of aggregate mass and underlies self-replication and generation of toxic oligomers associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the nature of the interactions between the monomeric species and the fibrils during this key process, and indeed the ultrastructural localization of the interaction sites have remained elusive. Here we used NMR and optical spectroscopy to identify conditions that enable the capture of transient species during the aggregation and secondary nucleation of the Abeta42 peptide. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images show that new aggregates protrude from the entire length of the progenitor fibril. These protrusions are morphologically distinct from the well-ordered fibrils dominating at the end of the aggregation process. The data provide direct evidence that self-replication through secondary nucleation occurs along the sides of fibrils, which become heavily decorated under the current solution conditions (14 microM Abeta42, 20 mM sodium phosphate, 200 microM EDTA, pH 6.8).",

    "abstract": "The proteolytic cleavage of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) to form the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide is related to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) because APP mutations that influence this processing either induce familial AD or mitigate the risk of AD. Yet Abeta formation itself may not be pathogenic. APP promotes neuronal iron efflux by stabilizing the cell-surface presentation of ferroportin, the only iron export channel of cells. Mislocalization of APP can promote iron retention, thus we hypothesized that changes in endocytotic trafficking associated with altered APP processing could contribute to the neuronal iron elevation and oxidative burden that feature in AD pathology. Here, we demonstrate, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, that endocytotic amyloidogenic processing of APP impairs iron export by destabilizing ferroportin on the cell surface. Conversely, preferential non-amyloidogenic processing of APP at the cell surface promotes ferroportin stabilization to decrease intraneuronal iron. A new Abeta-independent hypothesis emerges where the amyloidogenic processing of APP, combined with age-dependent iron elevation in the tissue, increases pro-oxidant iron burden in AD.",

    "abstract": "The association between white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and amyloid accumulation over time in cognitively normal, amyloid-negative elderly people remains largely unexplored. In order to study whether baseline WMH were associated with longitudinal subthreshold amyloid accumulation, 159 cognitively normal participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative who were amyloid-negative at baseline were examined. All the participants underwent a T1 and a Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery MRI scan at baseline. Amyloid PET imaging was performed at baseline and follow-up visits in 2-year intervals for up to 8 years. Partial volume correction was applied for quantifying cortical Standardised Uptake Value Ratios (SUVR). The associations between global and regional WMH burden and amyloid accumulation were assessed using linear mixed models adjusted by demographic characteristics and baseline SUVR. Partial volume correction increased the measured annual rate of change (+2.4%) compared to that obtained from non-corrected data (+0.5%). There were no significant correlations between baseline WMHs and baseline subthreshold cortical amyloid uptake. In a longitudinal analysis, increased baseline cortical SUVR and increased baseline burden of global (p = 0.006), frontal (p = 0.006), and parietal WMH (p = 0.003) were associated with faster amyloid accumulation. WMH-related amyloid accumulation occurred in parietal, frontal, and, to a lesser extent, cingulate cortices. These results remained unchanged after a sensitivity analysis excluding participants with the highest cortical SUVRs. This is the first study to identify a specific spatial distribution of WMH which is associated with future amyloid accumulation in cognitively normal elderly subjects without PET-detectable amyloid pathology. These findings may have important implications in prevention trials for the early identification of amyloid accumulation.",

    "abstract": "Multifactorial pathological processes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) begin decades prior to clinical onset. Early identification of patients at risk of developing AD using biomarkers reflecting various aspects of pathogenesis is necessary for prevention and early intervention. Cortical beta-amyloid (Abeta) burden assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Abeta42 are validated biomarkers for early identification. Recently, alterations in levels of neuronal proteins, neuronal pentraxin receptor (NPTXR) and neurofilament light (NfL), in the CSF have emerged as promising AD biomarkers. However, their association with Abeta deposition is not well understood. In this pilot study, we evaluate whether CSF NfL and NPTXR are associated with PET-Abeta imaging and core CSF biomarkers (Abeta42, T-tau, and P-tau). CSF samples were collected from a sub-cohort of participants from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle study of aging (AIBL) and categorized as either PET-Abeta positive (n = 15) or negative (n = 15). NPTXR was significantly lower in PET-Abeta positive than negative individuals (p =  0.04), and correlated with Abeta42 (rho = 0.69, p <  0.0001), T-tau (rho = 0.45, p =  0.01), and P-tau (rho = 0.51, p =  0.004). However, CSF NfL was not significantly different between PET-Abeta positive and negative individuals and did not correlate with any of the core CSF biomarkers. Similar associations of NPTXR and the core CSF biomarkers persisted in the cognitively normal individuals. Together, NPTXR concentration in CSF may be more sensitive NfL to identify AD risk during the preclinical stage, warranting further investigation into its contribution to AD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is characterized by amyloid plaques containing amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides, neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and neuronal loss. In addition, Abeta deposition in brain microvessels, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), increases blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and induces vascular dysfunction which aggravates AD pathology. The aim of the present study was to characterize neurovascular dysfunction in the Tg-SwDI mouse model of AD. Isolated brain capillaries from wild type (WT) and Tg-SwDI mice were used to evaluate the expression of monomeric and aggregated forms of Abeta, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the receptor for advance glycation end-products (RAGE) and the tight junction (TJs) proteins occludin and claudin-5. Cultured brain endothelial cells were used to analyze barrier function via fluorescein flux. Isolated capillaries from Tg-SwDI mice contained increased levels of aggregated and oligomeric Abeta compared to WT animals. Isolated capillaries from Tg-SwDI had decreased levels of P-gp, which transports Abeta from brain to blood, and increased levels of RAGE, which transports Abeta from blood to brain. In addition, the TJ protein occludin was decreased in Tg-SwDI mice relative to WT mice, which correlated with an increase in BBB permeability in cultured brain endothelial cells. These findings demonstrated that Tg-SwDI mice exhibit Abeta aggregation that is due, in part, to impaired Abeta clearance driven by both a decrease in P-gp and increase in RAGE protein levels in brain capillaries. Abeta aggregation promotes a decrease in the expression of the TJ protein occludin, and as consequence an increase in BBB permeability.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a progressive amyloidogenic disorder whose advancement is widely recognized to be connected to amyloid-beta peptides and Tau aggregation. However, several other processes likely contribute to the development of AD and some of them might be related to protein-protein interactions. Amyloid aggregates usually contain not only single type of amyloid protein, but also other type of proteins and this phenomenon can be rationally explained by the process of protein cross-seeding and co-assembly. Amyloid cross-interaction is ubiquitous in amyloid fibril formation and so a better knowledge of the amyloid interactome could help to further understand the mechanisms of amyloid related diseases. In this review, we discuss about the cross-interactions of amyloid-beta peptides, and in particular Abeta1-42, with other amyloids, which have been presented either as integrated part of Abeta neurotoxicity process (such as Tau) or conversely with a preventive role in AD pathogenesis by directly binding to Abeta (such as transthyretin, cystatin C and apolipoprotein A1). Particularly, we will focus on all the possible therapeutic strategies aiming to rescue the Abeta toxicity by taking inspiration from these protein-protein interactions.",

    "title": "A Role of Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 4 (LRP4) in Astrocytic Abeta Clearance.",
    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition occurs years before cognitive symptoms appear and is considered a cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The imbalance of Abeta production and clearance leads to Abeta accumulation and Abeta deposition. Increasing evidence indicates an important role of astrocytes, the most abundant cell type among glial cells in the brain, in Abeta clearance. We explored the role of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4), a member of the LDLR family, in AD pathology. We show that Lrp4 is specifically expressed in astrocytes and its levels in astrocytes were higher than those of Ldlr and Lrp1, both of which have been implicated in Abeta uptake. LRP4 was reduced in postmortem brain tissues of AD patients. Genetic deletion of the Lrp4 gene augmented Abeta plaques in 5xFAD male mice, an AD mouse model, and exacerbated the deficits in neurotransmission, synchrony between the hippocampus and PFC, and cognition. Mechanistically, LRP4 promotes Abeta uptake by astrocytes likely by interacting with ApoE. Together, our study demonstrates that astrocytic LRP4 plays an important role in Abeta pathology and cognitive function.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This study investigates how astrocytes, a type of non-nerve cells in the brain, may contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) development. We demonstrate that the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (LRP4) is reduced in the brain of AD patients. Mimicking the reduced levels in an AD mouse model exacerbates cognitive impairment and increases amyloid aggregates that are known to damage the brain. We show that LRP4 could promote the clearance of amyloid protein by astrocytes. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated role of LRP4 in AD development.",

We test this hypothesis in humans using an epidemic spreading model (ESM) to simulate tau spread, and compare these simulations to observed patterns measured using tau-PET in 312 individuals along Alzheimer's disease continuum. Up to 70% of the variance in the overall spatial pattern of tau can be explained by our model. Surprisingly, the ESM predicts the spatial patterns of tau irrespective of whether brain Abeta is present, but regions with greater Abeta burden show greater tau than predicted by connectivity patterns, suggesting a role of Abeta in accelerating tau spread. Altogether, our results provide evidence in humans that tau spreads through neuronal communication pathways even in normal aging, and that this process is accelerated by the presence of brain Abeta.",

Isolated reports have shown that variants that create or disrupt uORFs can cause disease. Here, in a systematic genome-wide study using 15,708 whole genome sequences, we show that variants that create new upstream start codons, and variants disrupting stop sites of existing uORFs, are under strong negative selection. This selection signal is significantly stronger for variants arising upstream of genes intolerant to loss-of-function variants. Furthermore, variants creating uORFs that overlap the coding sequence show signals of selection equivalent to coding missense variants. Finally, we identify specific genes where modification of uORFs likely represents an important disease mechanism, and report a novel uORF frameshift variant upstream of NF2 in neurofibromatosis. Our results highlight uORF-perturbing variants as an under-recognised functional class that contribute to penetrant human disease, and demonstrate the power of large-scale population sequencing data in studying non-coding variant classes.",

As national biobanks, disease-association studies, and clinical genetic testing have grown increasingly reliant on genome sequencing, population references such as the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)4 have become integral in the interpretation of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs)5. However, there are no reference maps of SVs from high-coverage genome sequencing comparable to those for SNVs. Here we present a reference of sequence-resolved SVs constructed from 14,891 genomes across diverse global populations (54% non-European) in gnomAD. We discovered a rich and complex landscape of 433,371 SVs, from which we estimate that SVs are responsible for 25-29% of all rare protein-truncating events per genome. We found strong correlations between natural selection against damaging SNVs and rare SVs that disrupt or duplicate protein-coding sequence, which suggests that genes that are highly intolerant to loss-of-function are also sensitive to increased dosage6. We also uncovered modest selection against noncoding SVs in cis-regulatory elements, although selection against protein-truncating SVs was stronger than all noncoding effects. Finally, we identified very large (over one megabase), rare SVs in 3.9% of samples, and estimate that 0.13% of individuals may carry an SV that meets the existing criteria for clinically important incidental findings7. This SV resource is freely distributed via the gnomAD browser8 and will have broad utility in population genetics, disease-association studies, and diagnostic screening.",

First, even essential genes, in which loss-of-function variants are not tolerated, can be highly successful as targets of inhibitory drugs. Second, in most genes, loss-of-function variants are sufficiently rare that genotype-based ascertainment of homozygous or compound heterozygous 'knockout' humans will await sample sizes that are approximately 1,000 times those presently available, unless recruitment focuses on consanguineous individuals. Third, automated variant annotation and filtering are powerful, but manual curation remains crucial for removing artefacts, and is a prerequisite for recall-by-genotype efforts.

Existing treatments are at best symptomatic. These diseases are characterized by the presence of, and believed to be caused by the formation of, filamentous inclusions of alpha-synuclein in brain cells2,3. However, the structures of alpha-synuclein filaments from the human brain are unknown. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, we show that alpha-synuclein inclusions from the brains of individuals with MSA are made of two types of filament, each of which consists of two different protofilaments. In each type of filament, non-proteinaceous molecules are present at the interface of the two protofilaments. Using two-dimensional class averaging, we show that alpha-synuclein filaments from the brains of individuals with MSA differ from those of individuals with DLB, which suggests that distinct conformers or strains characterize specific synucleinopathies. As is the case with tau assemblies4-9, the structures of alpha-synuclein filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with MSA differ from those formed in vitro using recombinant proteins, which has implications for understanding the mechanisms of aggregate propagation and neurodegeneration in the human brain. These findings have diagnostic and potential therapeutic relevance, especially because of the unmet clinical need to be able to image filamentous alpha-synuclein inclusions in the human brain.",

While preclinical studies in model organisms have raised some on-target toxicity concerns5-8, the biological consequences of LRRK2 inhibition have not been well characterized in humans. Here, we systematically analyze pLoF variants in LRRK2 observed across 141,456 individuals sequenced in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)9, 49,960 exome-sequenced individuals from the UK Biobank and over 4 million participants in the 23andMe genotyped dataset. After stringent variant curation, we identify 1,455 individuals with high-confidence pLoF variants in LRRK2. Experimental validation of three variants, combined with previous work10, confirmed reduced protein levels in 82.5% of our cohort. We show that heterozygous pLoF variants in LRRK2 reduce LRRK2 protein levels but that these are not strongly associated with any specific phenotype or disease state.

Small molecule compounds have been shown to suppress amyloid aggregation and cellular toxicity, but often the presence of a lipid membrane negates their activity. A high-throughput screen of 1800 small molecules was performed to search for membrane active inhibitors, and 21 primary hits were discovered. Through the use of fluorescence-based assays, transmission electron microscopy, and dot blot assays, the initial 21 primary hits were narrowed down to five lead compounds. Nuclear magnetic resonance and circular dichroism experiments were used for further confirmation of amyloid inhibition at the membrane interface and to obtain insights into the secondary structure of amyloid-beta, while size exclusion chromatography was used to characterize the size of Abeta species. Lastly, dye-leakage assays allowed us to understand how the addition of the five lead compounds affected amyloid-beta's ability to permeate the lipid bilayer. These results provide insights into small molecules that stabilize small amyloid species in the presence of membranes for the development of tool compounds for deeper investigations of these transient species.",

    "title": "Biological and clinical characteristics of gene carriers far from predicted onset in the Huntington's disease Young Adult Study (HD-YAS): a cross-sectional analysis.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Disease-modifying treatments are in development for Huntington's disease; crucial to their success is to identify a timepoint in a patient's life when there is a measurable biomarker of early neurodegeneration while clinical function is still intact. We aimed to identify this timepoint in a novel cohort of young adult premanifest Huntington's disease gene carriers (preHD) far from predicted clinical symptom onset. METHODS: We did the Huntington's disease Young Adult Study (HD-YAS) in the UK. We recruited young adults with preHD and controls matched for age, education, and sex to ensure each group had at least 60 participants with imaging data, accounting for scan fails. Controls either had a family history of Huntington's disease but a negative genetic test, or no known family history of Huntington's disease. All participants underwent detailed neuropsychiatric and cognitive assessments, including tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery and a battery assessing emotion, motivation, impulsivity and social cognition (EMOTICOM). Imaging (done for all participants without contraindications) included volumetric MRI, diffusion imaging, and multiparametric mapping. Biofluid markers of neuronal health were examined using blood and CSF collection. We did a cross-sectional analysis using general least-squares linear models to assess group differences and associations with age and CAG length, relating to predicted years to clinical onset. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR), with FDR <0 05 deemed a significant result. FINDINGS: Data were obtained between Aug 2, 2017, and April 25, 2019. We recruited 64 young adults with preHD and 67 controls. Mean ages of participants were 29 0 years (SD 5 6) and 29 1 years (5 7) in the preHD and control groups, respectively. We noted no significant evidence of cognitive or psychiatric impairment in preHD participants 23 6 years (SD 5 8) from predicted onset (FDR 0 22-0 87 for cognitive measures, 0 31-0 91 for neuropsychiatric measures). The preHD cohort had slightly smaller putamen volumes (FDR=0 03), but this did not appear to be closely related to predicted years to onset (FDR=0 54). There were no group differences in other brain imaging measures (FDR >0 16). CSF neurofilament light protein (NfL), plasma NfL, and CSF YKL-40 were elevated in this far-from-onset preHD cohort compared with controls (FDR<0 0001, =0 01, and =0 03, respectively). CSF NfL elevations were more likely in individuals closer to expected clinical onset (FDR <0 0001). INTERPRETATION: We report normal brain function yet a rise in sensitive measures of neurodegeneration in a preHD cohort approximately 24 years from predicted clinical onset. CSF NfL appears to be a more sensitive measure than plasma NfL to monitor disease progression. This preHD cohort is one of the earliest yet studied, and our findings could be used to inform decisions about when to initiate a potential future intervention to delay or prevent further neurodegeneration while function is intact.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a promising biomarker of active axonal injury and neuronal degeneration. We aimed to characterise cross-sectional and longitudinal plasma NfL measurements and determine the age at which NfL concentrations begin to differentiate between carriers of the presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A (Glu280Ala) mutation and age-matched non-carriers from the Colombian autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease kindred. METHODS: In this cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort study, members of the familial Alzheimer's disease Colombian kindred aged 8-75 years with no other neurological or health conditions were recruited from the Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative Registry at the University of Antioquia (Medellin, Colombia) between Aug 1, 1995, and Dec 15, 2018. We used a single molecule array immunoassay and log-transformed data to examine the relationship between plasma NfL concentrations and age, and establish the earliest age at which NfL concentrations begin to diverge between mutation carriers and non-carriers. FINDINGS: We enrolled a cohort of 1070 PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers and 1074 non-carriers with baseline assessments; of these participants, longitudinal measures (with a mean follow-up of 6 years) were available for 242 mutation carriers and 262 non-carriers. Plasma NfL measurements increased with age in both groups (p<0 0001), and began to differentiate carriers from non-carriers when aged 22 years (22 years before the estimated median age at mild cognitive impairment onset of 44 years), although the ability of plasma NfL to discriminate between carriers and non-carriers only reached high sensitivity close to the age of clinical onset. INTERPRETATION: Our findings further support the promise of plasma NfL as a biomarker of active neurodegeneration in the detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease and the evaluation of disease-modifying therapies.

We build upon our previous report of a beta-strand spanned by residues 30-42, which arranges into an antiparallel beta-sheet. New results presented here indicate that there is a second beta-strand formed by residues 11-24. Contrary to expectations, NMR data indicate that this second beta-strand is organized into a parallel beta-sheet despite the co-existence of an antiparallel beta-sheet in the same structure. In addition, the in-register parallel beta-sheet commonly observed for amyloid fibril structure does not apply to residues 11-24 in the 150-kDa oligomer. Rather, we present evidence for an inter-strand registry shift of three residues that likely alternate in direction between adjacent molecules along the beta-sheet. We corroborated this unexpected scheme for beta-strand organization using multiple two-dimensional NMR and 13C-13C dipolar recoupling experiments. Our findings indicate a previously unknown assembly pathway and inspire a suggestion as to why this aggregate does not grow to larger sizes.",

IgG1 and IgG4 isotypes of AX004, the humanized versions of DC8E8, accelerate tau uptake by human primary microglia isolated from post-mortem aged and diseased brains. This promoting activity requires the presence of the Fc-domain of the antibodies.The IgG1 isotype of AX004 showed greater ability to promote tau uptake compared to the IgG4 isotype, while none of the antibody-tau complexes provoked increased pro-inflammatory activity of microglia.

Using CRISPR-Cas9, we deplete SORL1 in hiPSCs to ask if loss of SORL1 contributes to AD pathogenesis by endosome dysfunction. SORL1-deficient hiPSC neurons show early endosome enlargement, a hallmark cytopathology of AD. There is no effect of SORL1 depletion on endosome size in hiPSC microglia, suggesting a selective effect on neuronal endosomal trafficking. We validate defects in neuronal endosomal traffic by showing altered localization of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in early endosomes, a site of APP cleavage by the beta-secretase (BACE). Inhibition of BACE does not rescue endosome enlargement in SORL1-deficient neurons, suggesting that this phenotype is independent of amyloidogenic APP processing. Our data, together with recent findings, underscore how sporadic AD pathways regulating endosomal trafficking and autosomal-dominant AD pathways regulating APP cleavage independently converge on the defining cytopathology of AD.",

    "title": "Rational design of a conformation-specific antibody for the quantification of Abeta oligomers.",
    "abstract": "Protein misfolding and aggregation is the hallmark of numerous human disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. This process involves the formation of transient and heterogeneous soluble oligomers, some of which are highly cytotoxic. A major challenge for the development of effective diagnostic and therapeutic tools is thus the detection and quantification of these elusive oligomers. Here, to address this problem, we develop a two-step rational design method for the discovery of oligomer-specific antibodies. The first step consists of an \"antigen scanning\" phase in which an initial panel of antibodies is designed to bind different epitopes covering the entire sequence of a target protein. This procedure enables the determination through in vitro assays of the regions exposed in the oligomers but not in the fibrillar deposits. The second step involves an \"epitope mining\" phase, in which a second panel of antibodies is designed to specifically target the regions identified during the scanning step. We illustrate this method in the case of the amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, whose oligomers are associated with Alzheimer's disease. Our results show that this approach enables the accurate detection and quantification of Abeta oligomers in vitro, and in Caenorhabditis elegans and mouse hippocampal tissues.",

    "title": "Crystal structure of a conformational antibody that binds tau oligomers and inhibits pathological seeding by extracts from donors with Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "Soluble oligomers of aggregated tau accompany the accumulation of insoluble amyloid fibrils, a histological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) and two dozen related neurodegenerative diseases. Both oligomers and fibrils seed the spread of Tau pathology, and by virtue of their low molecular weight and relative solubility, oligomers may be particularly pernicious seeds. Here, we report the formation of in vitro tau oligomers formed by an ionic liquid (IL15). Using IL15-induced recombinant tau oligomers and a dot blot assay, we discovered a mAb (M204) that binds oligomeric tau, but not tau monomers or fibrils. M204 and an engineered single-chain variable fragment (scFv) inhibited seeding by IL15-induced tau oligomers and pathological extracts from donors with AD and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. This finding suggests that M204-scFv targets pathological structures that are formed by tau in neurodegenerative diseases. We found that M204-scFv itself partitions into oligomeric forms that inhibit seeding differently, and crystal structures of the M204-scFv monomer, dimer, and trimer revealed conformational differences that explain differences among these forms in binding and inhibition. The efficiency of M204-scFv antibodies to inhibit the seeding by brain tissue extracts from different donors with tauopathies varied among individuals, indicating the possible existence of distinct amyloid polymorphs. We propose that by binding to oligomers, which are hypothesized to be the earliest seeding-competent species, M204-scFv may have potential as an early-stage diagnostic for AD and tauopathies, and also could guide the development of promising therapeutic antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment. Adenosinergic receptors are considered as a potential alternative in the management of several neurodegenerative disorders. However, there is no information available on the role of A2b receptor in the pathophysiology of AD. Therefore, the effect of Abeta on the level of expression of A2b receptor was investigated in discrete memory-sensitive mouse brain regions. Abeta (1-42) was injected intracerebroventricularly to healthy male mouse to induce AD-like behavioral manifestations on Day-1 (D-1) of the experimental protocol. The animals were subjected to the Morris water maze (MWM) test on D-14 to D-18. On D-18, the animals were subjected to the Y-maze test after 30 min lag to the MWM paradigm. Abeta significantly attenuated the spatial working memory in MWM and Y-maze tests. In addition, Abeta significantly increased cholinergic dysfunction in terms of decrease in the activity of ChAT and ACh level and increase in the AChE activity in the hippocampus, pre-frontal cortex and amygdala of AD-like animals. Further, there was a significant increase in the extent of apoptosis in the selected mouse brain regions. Moreover, Abeta caused a substantial reduction in the mitochondrial function, integrity and bioenergetics in all the mouse brain regions. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in the level of expression of A2b receptors in the selected brain regions of the rodents. Hence, it can be assumed that A2b receptor downregulation could be another therapeutic target in the management of AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies have found that autophagy could promote the clearance of Abeta. To promote and maintain the occurrence of autophagy in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) might be a potential way to reduce neuronal loss and improve the learning and memory of AD. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible mechanisms of Yishen Huazhuo Decoction (YHD) against AD model. METHODS: Forty 7-month-old male SAMP8 mice were randomly divided into model (P8) group and YHD group, 20 in each group, with 20 SAMR1 mice as control (R1) group. All mice were intragastrically administered for 4 weeks, YHD at the dosage of 6.24g/kg for YHD group, and distilled water for P8 group and R1 group. Morris Water Maze (MWM) test, Nissl's staining, TEM, TUNEL staining, immunofluorescence double staining, and western blot analysis were applied to learning and memory, structure and ultrastructure of neurons, autophagosome, apoptosis index, Abeta, LAMP1, and autophagy related proteins. RESULTS: The escape latency time of YHD group was significantly shorter on the 4th and 5th day during MWM test than those in P8 group (P=0.011, 0.008<0.05), and the number of crossing platform in YHD group increased significantly (P=0.02<0.05). Nissl's staining showed that the number of neurons in YHD group increased significantly (P<0.0001). TEM showed in YHD group that the nucleus of neurons was slightly irregular, with slightly reduced organelles, partially fused and blurred cristae and membrane of mitochondria. The apoptosis index of YHD group showed a decreasing trend, without statistically significant difference (P=0.093>0.05), while Caspase3 expression in YHD group was significantly lower (P=0.044<0.05). YHD could promote the clearance of Abeta1-42 protein, improve the expression of Beclin-1 and p-Bcl2 proteins, reduce mTOR and p62 proteins. CONCLUSION: YHD could induce autophagy initiation, increase the formation of autophagosomes and autolysosome, promote the degradation of autophagy substrates, thereby regulating autophagy, and promoting the clearance of Abeta1-42 to improve memory impairment in SAMP8 mice.",

    "abstract": "Adrenergic beta receptor activation prevents human soluble amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) in slices. On the basis of the evidence that human Abeta1-42-induced impairment of LTP is due to Abeta1-42-mediated Zn2+ toxicity, we postulated that adrenergic beta receptor activation reduces Abeta1-42-mediated intracellular Zn2+ toxicity followed by rescuing Abeta1-42 toxicity. To test the effect of adrenergic beta receptor activation, LTP was recorded at perforant pathway-dentate granule cell synapses of anesthetized rats 60 min after Abeta1-42 injection into the dentate granule cell layer. Human Abeta1-42-induced impairment of LTP was rescued by co-injection of isoproterenol, an adrenergic beta receptor agonist, but not by co-injection of phenylephrine, an adrenergic alpha1 receptor agonist. Isoproterenol did not reduce Abeta1-42 uptake into dentate granule cells, but reduced increase in intracellular Zn2+ in dentate granule cells induced by Abeta1-42. In contrast, phenylephrine did not reduce both Abeta1-42 uptake and increase in intracellular Zn2+ by Abeta1-42. In the case of human Abeta1-40 and rat Abeta1-42, which do not increase intracellular Zn2+, human Abeta1-40- and rat Abeta1-42-induced impairments of LTP were not rescued by co-injection of isoproterenol. The present study indicates that adrenergic beta receptor activation reduces Abeta1-42-mediated increase in intracellular Zn2+ in dentate granule cells, resulting in rescuing Abeta1-42-induced impairment of LTP. It is likely that noradrenergic neuron activation by stimulating the locus coeruleus is effective for rescuing Abeta1-42-induced cognitive decline that is caused by intracellular Zn2+ dysregulation in the hippocampus.",

Although studies in mouse models have implicated specific Trem2-dependent microglial functions in AD, the underlying molecular mechanisms and translatability to human disease remain poorly defined. In this study, we used genetically engineered human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia-like cells to show that TREM2 signals through PLCgamma2 to mediate cell survival, phagocytosis, processing of neuronal debris, and lipid metabolism. Loss of TREM2 or PLCgamma2 signaling leads to a shared signature of transcriptional dysregulation that underlies these phenotypes. Independent of TREM2, PLCgamma2 also signals downstream of Toll-like receptors to mediate inflammatory responses. Therefore, PLCgamma2 activity regulates divergent microglial functions via distinct TREM2-dependent and -independent signaling and might be involved in the transition to a microglial state associated with neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease, amyloid deposits along the brain vasculature lead to a condition known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which impairs blood-brain barrier (BBB) function and accelerates cognitive degeneration. Apolipoprotein (APOE4) is the strongest risk factor for CAA, yet the mechanisms underlying this genetic susceptibility are unknown. Here we developed an induced pluripotent stem cell-based three-dimensional model that recapitulates anatomical and physiological properties of the human BBB in vitro. Similarly to CAA, our in vitro BBB displayed significantly more amyloid accumulation in APOE4 compared to APOE3. Combinatorial experiments revealed that dysregulation of calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling and APOE in pericyte-like mural cells induces APOE4-associated CAA pathology. In the human brain, APOE and NFAT are selectively dysregulated in pericytes of APOE4 carriers, and inhibition of calcineurin-NFAT signaling reduces APOE4-associated CAA pathology in vitro and in vivo. Our study reveals the role of pericytes in APOE4-mediated CAA and highlights calcineurin-NFAT signaling as a therapeutic target in CAA and Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation is one of the main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), the pathogen of chronic periodontitis, could cause Abeta accumulation and was identified in the brain of AD patients. Salvianolic Acid B (SalB) has been proven to have the neuroprotective effect. Whether SalB could protect against P. gingivalis-induced cognitive impairment is still unknown. In this study, a P. gingivalis-infected mouse model was employed to study the neuroprotective role of SalB. The results showed that SalB (20 and 40 mg/kg) treatment for 4 weeks could shorten the escape latency and improve the percentage of spontaneous alternation in the P. gingivalis-infected mice. SalB inhibited the levels of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, while increased the levels of antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase). SalB decreased the levels of IL-1beta and IL-6, increased the mRNA levels of bdnf and ngf in the brain of P. gingivalis-infected mice. In addition, SalB obviously decreased the level of Abeta. SalB elevated the protein expression of ADAM10, while downregulated BACE1 and PS1. SalB increased the protein expression of LRP1, while decreased RAGE. In conclusion, SalB could improve cognitive impairment by inhibiting neuroinflammation and decreasing Abeta level in P. gingivalis-infected mice.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), where beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposits around cerebral blood vessels, is a major contributor of vascular dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, the molecular mechanism underlying CAA formation and CAA-induced cerebrovascular pathology is unclear. Hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy (HCAA) is a rare familial form of CAA in which mutations within the (Abeta) peptide cause an increase in vascular deposits. Since the interaction between Abeta and fibrinogen increases CAA and plays an important role in cerebrovascular damage in AD, we investigated the role of the Abeta-fibrinogen interaction in HCAA pathology. Our work revealed the most common forms of HCAA-linked mutations, Dutch (E22Q) and Iowa (D23N), resulted in up to a 50-fold stronger binding affinity of Abeta for fibrinogen. In addition, the stronger interaction between fibrinogen and mutant Abetas led to a dramatic perturbation of clot structure and delayed fibrinolysis. Immunofluorescence analysis of the occipital cortex showed an increase of fibrin(ogen)/Abeta codeposition, as well as fibrin deposits in HCAA patients, compared to early-onset AD patients and nondemented individuals. Our results suggest the HCAA-type Dutch and Iowa mutations increase the interaction between fibrinogen and Abeta, which might be central to cerebrovascular pathologies observed in HCAA.",

    "title": "Utility of FDG-PET in diagnosis of Alzheimer-related TDP-43 proteinopathy.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate FDG-PET as an antemortem diagnostic tool for Alzheimer-related TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional neuroimaging-histologic analysis of patients with antemortem FDG-PET and postmortem brain tissue from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and Study of Aging with Alzheimer spectrum pathology. TDP-43-positive status was assigned when TDP-43-immunoreactive inclusions were identified in the amygdala. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analyses compared TDP-43-positive (TDP-43[+]) with TDP-43-negative cases (TDP-43[-]), correcting for field strength, sex, Braak neurofibrillary tangle, and neuritic plaque stages. Cross-validated logistic regression analyses were used to determine whether regional FDG-PET values predict TDP-43 status. We also assessed the ratio of inferior temporal to medial temporal (IMT) metabolism as this was proposed as a biomarker of hippocampal sclerosis. RESULTS: Of 73 cases, 27 (37%) were TDP-43(+), of which 6 (8%) had hippocampal sclerosis. SPM analysis showed TDP-43(+) cases having greater hypometabolism of medial temporal, frontal superior medial, and frontal supraorbital (FSO) regions (p unc < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed only FSO and IMT to be associated with TDP-43(+) status, identifying up to 81% of TDP-43(+) cases (p < 0.001). An IMT/FSO ratio was superior to the IMT in discriminating TDP-43(+) cases: 78% vs 48%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Alzheimer-related TDP-43 proteinopathy is associated with hypometabolism in the medial temporal and frontal regions. Combining FDG-PET measures from these regions may be useful for antemortem prediction of Alzheimer-related TDP-43 proteinopathy. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that hypometabolism in the medial temporal and frontal regions on FDG-PET is associated with Alzheimer-related TDP-43 proteinopathy.",

    "abstract": "Aging and female sex are the major risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and its associated brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) neuropathology, but the mechanisms mediating these risk factors remain uncertain. Evidence indicates that Abeta aggregation by Zn2+ released from glutamatergic neurons contributes to amyloid neuropathology, so we tested whether aging and sex adversely influences this neurophysiology. Using acute hippocampal slices, we found that extracellular Zn2+-elevation induced by high K+ stimulation was significantly greater with older (65 weeks vs 10 weeks old) rats, and was exaggerated in females. This was driven by slower reuptake of extracellular Zn2+, which could be recapitulated by mitochondrial intoxication. Zn2+:Abeta aggregates were toxic to the slices, but Abeta alone was not. Accordingly, high K+ caused synthetic human Abeta added to the slices to form soluble oligomers as detected by bis-ANS, attaching to neurons and inducing toxicity, with older slices being more vulnerable. Age-dependent energy failure impairing Zn2+ reuptake, and a higher maximal capacity for Zn2+ release by females, could contribute to age and sex being major risk factors for Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by abnormal accumulation of extracellular beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques and neuronal damage. The present study investigated the effect of chronic intra-hippocampal agmatine administration on beta-Amyloid (Abeta) induced memory impairment in mice. Abeta1-42 peptide injected mice demonstrated impairment of cognitive abilities evaluated as reference memory error and working memory error in radial arm maze (RAM) and decreased exploration time for novel object as well as recognition index in novel object recognition (NOR) test along with elevation in Abeta1-42 peptide, beta-Site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE 1), microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPt), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and reduction in neprilysin and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) immunocontent within hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Importantly, this was associated with a reduction in the agmatine levels following Abeta1-42 peptide administration. Chronic administration of agmatine from day 8-27, prevented the memory impairment in mice and normalized the neurochemical alteration within prefrontal cortex and hippocampus induced by Abeta1-42 peptide administration. However, it did not modulate the amyloid precursor protein and BACE expression. This study suggests that agmatine improves learning and memory impairment possibly through the down regulation of neuroinflammatory pathways in AD.",

    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits may cause impairments in choroid plexus, a specialised brain structure which forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier. We previously carried out a mass proteomic-based study in choroid plexus from AD patients and we found several differentially regulated proteins compared with healthy subjects. One of these proteins, annexin A5, was previously demonstrated implicated in blocking Abeta-induced cytotoxicity in neuronal cell cultures. Here, we investigated the effects of annexin A5 on Abeta toxicity in choroid plexus. We used choroid plexus tissue samples and CSF from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients to analyse Abeta accumulation, cell death and annexin A5 levels compared with control subjects. Choroid plexus cell cultures from rats were used to analyse annexin A5 effects on Abeta-induced cytotoxicity. AD choroid plexus exhibited progressive reduction of annexin A5 levels along with progressive increased Abeta accumulation and cell death as disease stage was higher. On the other hand, annexin A5 levels in CSF from patients were found progressively increased as the disease stage increased in severity. In choroid plexus primary cultures, Abeta administration reduced endogenous annexin A5 levels in a time-course dependent manner and simultaneously increased annexin A5 levels in extracellular medium. Annexin A5 addition to choroid plexus cell cultures restored the Abeta-induced impairments on autophagy flux and apoptosis in a calcium-dependent manner. We propose that annexin A5 would exert a protective role in choroid plexus and this protection is lost as Abeta accumulates with the disease progression. Then, brain protection against further toxic insults would be jeopardised.",

    "abstract": "Importance: Social determinants of health, such as income, education, housing quality, and employment, are associated with disparities in Alzheimer disease and health generally, yet these determinants are rarely incorporated within neuropathology research. Objective: To establish the feasibility of linking neuropathology data to social determinants of health exposures using neighborhood disadvantage metrics (the validated Area Deprivation Index) and to evaluate the association between neighborhood disadvantage and Alzheimer disease-related neuropathology. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study consisted of decedents with a known home address who donated their brains to 1 of 2 Alzheimer disease research center brain banks in California and Wisconsin between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2016. Neither site had preexisting social metrics available for their decedents. Neuropathologic features were obtained from each site for data collected using the standardized Neuropathology Data Set form and from autopsy reports. Data were analyzed from June 7 to October 10, 2019. Exposures: Geocoded decedent addresses linked to neighborhood disadvantage as measured by the Area Deprivation Index calculated for the year of death. Main Outcomes and Measures: Presence of Alzheimer disease neuropathology. The association between neighborhood disadvantage and Alzheimer disease neuropathology was evaluated via logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, and year of death. Results: The sample consisted of 447 decedents (249 men [56%]; mean [SD] age, 80.3 [9.5] years; median year of death, 2011) spanning 24 years of donation. Fewer decedents (n = 24 [5.4%]) originated from the top 20% most disadvantaged neighborhood contexts. Increasing neighborhood disadvantage was associated with an 8.1% increase in the odds of Alzheimer disease neuropathology for every decile change on the Area Deprivation Index (adjusted odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.07-1.09). As such, living in the most disadvantaged neighborhood decile was associated with a 2.18 increased odds of Alzheimer disease neuropathology (adjusted odds ratio, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.99-2.39). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that social determinants of health data can be linked to preexisting autopsy samples as a means to study sociobiological mechanisms involved in neuropathology. This novel technique has the potential to be applied to any brain bank within the United States. To our knowledge, this is the first time Alzheimer disease neuropathology has been associated with neighborhood disadvantage.",

    "abstract": "Here, we perform a genome-wide screen for variants that regulate the expression of gene co-expression modules in the aging human brain; we discover and replicate such variants in the TMEM106B and RBFOX1 loci. The TMEM106B haplotype is known to influence the accumulation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy, and the haplotype's large-scale transcriptomic effects include the dysregulation of lysosomal genes and alterations in synaptic gene splicing that are also seen in the pathophysiology of TDP-43 proteinopathy. Further, a variant near GRN, another TDP-43 proteinopathy susceptibility gene, shows concordant effects with the TMEM106B haplotype. Leveraging neuropathology data from the same participants, we also show that TMEM106B and APOE-amyloid-beta effects converge to alter myelination and lysosomal gene expression, which then contributes to TDP-43 accumulation. These results advance our mechanistic understanding of the TMEM106B TDP-43 risk haplotype and uncover a transcriptional program that mediates the converging effects of APOE-amyloid-beta and TMEM106B on TDP-43 aggregation in older adults.",

    "abstract": "Axonal damage leads to the release of neurofilament light chain (NFL), which enters the CSF or blood. In this work, an assay kit for plasma NFL utilizing immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) was developed. Antibodies against NFL were immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles to develop an IMR NFL kit. The preclinical properties, such as the standard curve, limit of detection (LoD), and dynamic range, were characterized. Thirty-one normal controls (NC), fifty-two patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) or PD dementia (PDD) and thirty-one patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were enrolled in the study evaluating the plasma NFL assay using an IMR kit. T-tests and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed to investigate the capability for discrimination among the clinical groups according to plasma NFL levels. The LoD of the NFL assay using the IMR kit was found to be 0.18 fg/ml. The dynamic range of the NFL assay reached 1000 pg/ml. The NC group showed a plasma NFL level of 7.70 +- 4.00 pg/ml, which is significantly lower than that of the PD/PDD (15.85 +- 7.82 pg/ml, p < 0.001) and AD (19.24 +- 8.99 pg/ml, p < 0.001) groups. A significant difference in plasma NFL levels was determined between the PD and AD groups (p < 0.01). Through ROC curve analysis, the cut-off value of the plasma NFL concentration for differentiating NCs from dementia patients (AD and PD/PDD) was found to be 12.71 pg/ml, with a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 73.5% and 90.3%, respectively. The AUC was 0.868. Furthermore, the cut-off value of the plasma NFL concentration for discriminating AD from PD/PDD was found to be 18.02 pg/ml, with a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 61.3% and 65.4%, respectively. The AUC was 0.630. An ultrasensitive assay for measuring plasma NFL utilizing IMR technology was developed. Clear differences in plasma NFL concentrations were observed among NCs and PD and AD patients.

    "abstract": "Autophagy has been reported to play a dual \"double-edged sword\" role in the occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To assess the relationship between AD and autophagy, the dynamic changes of autophagic flux in the brain of postmortem AD patients, animal models and cell models were studied. The results showed that autophagosomes (APs) accumulation and expression of lysosomal markers were decreased in the brains of AD patients. In the brain of APP/PS1 double transgenic mice, APs did not accumulate before the formation of SPs but accumulated along with the deposition of SPs, as well as the level of lysosomal markers cathepsin B and Lamp1 protein decreased significantly. In the brains of APP/PS1/LC3 triple - transgenic mice, the number of APs increased with age, but the number of ALs did not increase accordingly. The activation of autophagy is mainly due to the increase in Abeta rather than the overexpression of mutated APP gene. However, both the treatment with exogenous Abeta25-35 and the mutation of the endogenous APP gene blocked the fusion of APs with lysosomes and decreased lysosomal functioning in AD model cells, which may be the main mechanism of autophagy dysregulation in AD.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate the performance of deep learning-based generalization of ultra-low-count amyloid PET/MRI enhancement when applied to studies acquired with different scanning hardware and protocols. METHODS: Eighty simultaneous [18F]florbetaben PET/MRI studies were acquired, split equally between two sites (site 1: Signa PET/MRI, GE Healthcare, 39 participants, 67 +- 8 years, 23 females; site 2: mMR, Siemens Healthineers, 64 +- 11 years, 23 females) with different MRI protocols. Twenty minutes of list-mode PET data (90-110 min post-injection) were reconstructed as ground-truth. Ultra-low-count data obtained from undersampling by a factor of 100 (site 1) or the first minute of PET acquisition (site 2) were reconstructed for ultra-low-dose/ultra-short-time (1% dose and 5% time, respectively) PET images. A deep convolution neural network was pre-trained with site 1 data and either (A) directly applied or (B) trained further on site 2 data using transfer learning. Networks were also trained from scratch based on (C) site 2 data or (D) all data. Certified physicians determined amyloid uptake (+/-) status for accuracy and scored the image quality. The peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity, and root-mean-squared error were calculated between images and their ground-truth counterparts. Mean regional standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR, reference region: cerebellar cortex) from 37 successful site 2 FreeSurfer segmentations were analyzed. RESULTS: All network-synthesized images had reduced noise than their ultra-low-count reconstructions. Quantitatively, image metrics improved the most using method B, where SUVRs had the least variability from the ground-truth and the highest effect size to differentiate between positive and negative images. Method A images had lower accuracy and image quality than other methods; images synthesized from methods B-D scored similarly or better than the ground-truth images. CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning can successfully produce diagnostic amyloid PET images from short frame reconstructions. Data bias should be considered when applying pre-trained deep ultra-low-count amyloid PET/MRI networks for generalization.",

    "title": "Restricted Effect of Cerebral Microbleeds on Regional Magnetic Susceptibility.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cortical iron accumulation has been reported as a pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cause of cortical iron elevation in AD is unknown but may be contributed by hemosiderin deposits in cerebral microbleeds that frequently occur in this disease. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of cerebral microbleeds (which are more frequent in AD) on the magnetic susceptibility of the surrounding brain tissue. METHODS: 32 MRI scans from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle (AIBL) study were found to have cerebral microbleeds by manual assessment of susceptibility weighted images. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM; an MRI technique that is sensitive to iron) was used to estimate iron content in the tissue surrounding the microbleed in four concentric radii. Furthermore, the mirror regions on the contralateral hemisphere were also demarcated. A simulation analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of QSM imaging on cerebral microbleeds with varying sizes. RESULTS: 77 microbleeds were identified from the available scans. The immediate proximal region to the cerebral microbleeds had enhanced tissue susceptibility (~0.02 PPM), but importantly, this did not extend beyond one voxel radius. This finding with in vivo data was also replicated in a simulation study. However, the presence of microbleeds could lead to over-estimation of tissue QSM in unsupervised quantification, therefore processing methods to avoid this artefact without the need for their manual identification are proposed. CONCLUSION: The local changes in susceptibility due to microbleeds outside the focal lesion are restricted to 1 voxel and may be explained by partial voluming artefacts caused by limited imaging resolution. The susceptibly change induced by the microbleed is a relatively small proportion of tissue and could not account for regional iron changes observed in AD cortex.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are detectable cognitive differences in cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cross-sectional performance on the Cogstate Brief Battery (CBB) and Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) could identify 1) CU participants with preclinical AD defined by neuroimaging biomarkers of amyloid and tau, and 2) incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/dementia. METHOD: CU participants age 50+ were eligible if they had 1) amyloid (A) and tau (T) imaging within two years of their baseline CBB or 2) at least one follow-up visit. AUROC analyses assessed the ability of measures to differentiate groups. We explored the frequency of cross-sectional subtle objective cognitive impairment (sOBJ) defined as performance <=-1 SD on CBB Learning/Working Memory Composite (Lrn/WM) or AVLT delayed recall using age-corrected normative data. RESULTS: A+T+ (n = 33, mean age 79.5) and A+T- (n = 61, mean age 77.8) participants were older than A-T- participants (n = 146, mean age 66.3), and comparable on sex and education. Lrn/WM did not differentiate A + T+or A+T- from A-T- participants. AVLT differentiated both A+T+ and A+T- from A-T- participants; 45% of A+T+ and 25% of A+T- participants met sOBJ criteria. The follow-up cohort included 150 CU individuals who converted to MCI/dementia and 450 age, sex, and education matched controls. Lrn/WM and AVLT differentiated between stable and converter CU participants. CONCLUSION: Among CU participants, AVLT helped differentiate A+T+ and A+T- from A-T- participants. The CBB did not differentiate biomarker subgroups, but showed potential for predicting incident MCI/dementia. Results inform future definitions of sOBJ.",

    "title": "Serum Hepcidin Levels in Cognitively Normal Older Adults with High Neocortical Amyloid-beta Load.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Hepcidin, an iron-regulating hormone, suppresses the release of iron by binding to the iron exporter protein, ferroportin, resulting in intracellular iron accumulation. Given that iron dyshomeostasis has been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) together with elevated serum hepcidin levels, the current study examined whether elevated serum hepcidin levels are an early event in AD pathogenesis by measuring the hormone in cognitively normal older adults at risk of AD, based on high neocortical amyloid-beta load (NAL). METHODS: Serum hepcidin levels in cognitively normal participants (n = 100) aged between 65-90 years were measured using ELISA. To evaluate NAL, all participants underwent 18F-florbetaben positron emission tomography. A standard uptake value ratio (SUVR)<1.35 was classified as low NAL (n = 65) and >=1.35 (n = 35) was classified as high NAL. RESULTS: Serum hepcidin was significantly higher in participants with high NAL compared to those with low NAL before and after adjusting for covariates: age, gender, and APOEe4 carriage (p < 0.05). A receiver operating characteristic curve based on a logistic regression of the same covariates, the base model, distinguished high from low NAL (area under the curve, AUC = 0.766), but was outperformed when serum hepcidin was added to the base model (AUC = 0.794) and further improved with plasma Abeta42/40 ratio (AUC = 0.829). CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate that serum hepcidin is increased in individuals at risk for AD and contribute to the body of evidence supporting iron dyshomeostasis as an early event of AD. Further, hepcidin may add value to a panel of markers that contribute toward identifying individuals at risk of AD; however, further validation studies are required.",

Here, we present the three-dimensional structure of an Abeta oligomer formed in a membrane mimicking environment, namely an Abeta(1-42) tetramer, which comprises a six stranded beta-sheet core. The two faces of the beta-sheet core are hydrophobic and surrounded by the membrane-mimicking environment while the edges are hydrophilic and solvent-exposed. By increasing the concentration of Abeta(1-42) in the sample, Abeta(1-42) octamers are also formed, made by two Abeta(1-42) tetramers facing each other forming a beta-sandwich structure. Notably, Abeta(1-42) tetramers and octamers inserted into lipid bilayers as well-defined pores. To establish oligomer structure-membrane activity relationships, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out. These studies revealed a mechanism of membrane disruption in which water permeation occurred through lipid-stabilized pores mediated by the hydrophilic residues located on the core beta-sheets edges of the oligomers.",

Here, we applied cryo-EM to reconstruct densities of three dominant IAPP fibril polymorphs, formed in vitro from synthetic human IAPP. An atomic model of the main polymorph, built from a density map of 4.2-A resolution, reveals two S-shaped, intertwined protofilaments. The segment 21-NNFGAIL-27, essential for IAPP amyloidogenicity, forms the protofilament interface together with Tyr37 and the amidated C terminus. The S-fold resembles polymorphs of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated amyloid-beta (Abeta) fibrils, which might account for the epidemiological link between T2D and AD and reports on IAPP-Abeta cross-seeding in vivo. The results structurally link the early-onset T2D IAPP genetic polymorphism (encoding Ser20Gly) with the AD Arctic mutation (Glu22Gly) of Abeta and support the design of inhibitors and imaging probes for IAPP fibrils.",

Both pathologies are part of the degenerative disorders named amyloidoses, which involve the misfolding and the aggregation of amyloid peptides, hIAPP for T2D and Abeta1-42 for AD. While hIAPP and Abeta1-42 inhibitors have been essentially designed to target beta-sheet-rich structures composing the toxic amyloid oligomers and fibrils of these peptides, the strategy aiming at trapping the non-toxic monomers in their helical native conformation has been rarely explored. We report herein the first example of helical foldamers as dual inhibitors of hIAPP and Abeta1-42 aggregation and able to preserve the monomeric species of both amyloid peptides. A foldamer composed of 4-amino(methyl)-1,3-thiazole-5-carboxylic acid (ATC) units, adopting a 9-helix structure reminiscent of 310 helix, was remarkable as demonstrated by biophysical assays combining thioflavin-T fluorescence, transmission electronic microscopy, capillary electrophoresis and mass spectrometry.",

METHODS: Amyloid-beta 1 to 42 (Abeta42 ), total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) at the threonine 181 position were measured using the high-precision Roche Elecsys electrochemiluminescence immunoassay in all available CSF samples from longitudinally studied patients with PD (n = 416) and HCs (n = 192) followed for up to 3 years in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Longitudinal CSF and clinical data were analyzed with linear-mixed effects models. RESULTS: We found patients with PD had lower CSF t-tau (median = 157.7 pg/mL; range = 80.9-467.0); p-tau (median = 13.4 pg/mL; range = 8.0-40.1), and Abeta42 (median = 846.2 pg/mL; range = 238.8-3,707.0) than HCs at baseline (CSF t-tau median = 173.5 pg/mL; range = 82.0-580.8; p-tau median = 15.4 pg/mL; range = 8.1-73.6; and Abeta42 median = 926.5 pg/mL; range = 239.1-3,297.0; p < 0.05-0.001) and a moderate-to-strong correlation among these biomarkers in both patients with PD and HCs (Rho = 0.50-0.97; p < 0.001). Of the patients with PD, 31.5% had pathologically low levels of CSF Abeta42 at baseline and these patients with PD had lower p-tau levels (median = 10.8 pg/mL; range = 8.0-32.8) compared with 27.7% of HCs with pathologically low CSF Abeta42 (CSF p-tau median = 12.8 pg/mL; range 8.2-73.6; p < 0.03). In longitudinal CSF analysis, we found patients with PD had greater decline in CSF Abeta42 (mean difference = -41.83 pg/mL; p = 0.03) and CSF p-tau (mean difference = -0.38 pg/mL; p = 0.03) at year 3 compared with HCs. Baseline CSF Abeta42 values predicted small but measurable decline on cognitive, autonomic, and motor function in early PD. INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest baseline CSF AD biomarkers may have prognostic value in early PD and that the dynamic change of these markers, although modest over a 3-year period, suggest biomarker profiles in PD may deviate from healthy aging.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by plaques containing amyloid-beta (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles composed of aggregated, hyperphosphorylated tau. Beyond tau and Abeta, evidence suggests that microglia play an important role in AD pathogenesis. Rare variants in the microglia-expressed triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) gene increase AD risk 2- to 4-fold. It is likely that these TREM2 variants increase AD risk by decreasing the response of microglia to Abeta and its local toxicity. However, neocortical Abeta pathology occurs many years before neocortical tau pathology in AD. Thus, it will be important to understand the role of TREM2 in the context of tauopathy. We investigated the impact of the AD-associated TREM2 variant (R47H) on tau-mediated neuropathology in the PS19 mouse model of tauopathy. We assessed PS19 mice expressing human TREM2CV (common variant) or human TREM2R47H. PS19-TREM2R47H mice had significantly attenuated brain atrophy and synapse loss versus PS19-TREM2CV mice. Gene expression analyses and CD68 immunostaining revealed attenuated microglial reactivity in PS19-TREM2R47H versus PS19-TREM2CV mice. There was also a decrease in phagocytosis of postsynaptic elements by microglia expressing TREM2R47H in the PS19 mice and in human AD brains. These findings suggest that impaired TREM2 signaling reduces microglia-mediated neurodegeneration in the setting of tauopathy.",

Pure Abeta(1-40) amyloid peptides form insoluble monolayers without forming fibril-like structures. In a lipid environment [phospholipid/Abeta(1-40) peptide mixtures], we observed that both miscibility and stability of the films depend on the peptide content. At low Abeta(1-40) amyloid peptide proportion (from 2.5 to 10% of peptide area proportion), we observed the formation of a fibril-like structure when mixed only with POPC lipids. The stability acquired by these mixed films is within 20-35 mN m-1 compatible with the equivalent surface pressure postulated for natural biomembranes. Fibrils are clearly evidenced directly from the monolayers by using Brewster angle microscopy. The so-called nanostructured fibrils are thioflavin T positive when observed by fluorescence microscopy. The amyloid fibril network at the surface was also evidenced by atomic force microscopy when the films are transferred onto a mica support. Abeta(1-40) amyloid mixed with the solid DSPC lipid showed an immiscible behavior in all peptide proportions without fibril formation. We postulated that the amyloid fibrillogenesis at the membrane can be dynamically nano-self-triggered at the surface by the quality of the interfacial environment, that is, the physical state of the water-lipid interface and the relative content of amyloid protein present at the interface.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein is related to Alzheimer disease (AD), and various experiments have shown that oligomers as small as dimers are cytotoxic. Recent studies have concluded that interactions of Abeta with neuronal cell membranes lead to disruption of membrane integrity and toxicity and they play a key role in the development of AD. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to investigate Abeta in aqueous solution and membranes. We have previously studied monomeric Abeta40 embedded in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) membrane using MD simulations. Here, we explore interactions of two Abeta40 peptides in DPPC bilayer and its consequences on dimer distribution in a lipid bilayer and on the secondary structure of the peptides. We explored that N-terminals played an important role in dimeric Abeta peptide aggregations and Abeta-bilayer interactions, while C-terminals bound peptides to bilayer like anchors. We did not observe exiting of peptides in our simulations although we observed insertion of peptides into the core of bilayer in some of our simulations. So it seems that the presence of Abeta on membrane surface increases its aggregation rate, and as diffusion occurs in two dimensions, it can increase the probability of interpeptide interactions. We found that dimeric Abeta, like monomeric one, had the ability to cause structural destabilization of DPPC membrane, which in turn might ultimately lead to cell death in an in vivo system. This information could have important implications for understanding the affinity of Abeta oligomers (here dimer) for membranes and the mechanism of Abeta oligomer toxicity in AD.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid beta (Abeta) is an intricate molecule that interacts with several biomolecules and/or produces insoluble assemblies and eventually the nonphysiological depositions of its alternate with normal neuronal conditions leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta is formed through the proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Significant efforts are being made to explore the exact role of Abeta in AD pathogenesis. It is believed that the deposition of Abeta in the brain takes place from Abeta components which are derived from the brain itself. However, recent evidence suggests that Abeta derived also from the periphery and hence the Abeta circulating in the blood is capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the role of Abeta derived from the periphery is largely unknown so far. Therefore, Abeta origin determination and the underlying mechanisms of its pathological effects are of considerable interest in exploring effective therapeutic strategies. The purpose of this review is to provide a novel insight into AD pathogenesis based on Abeta in both the brain and periphery and highlight new therapeutic avenues to combat AD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Many gaps in our understanding of Alzheimer's disease remain despite intense research efforts. One such prominent gap is the mechanism of Tau condensation and fibrillization. One viewpoint is that positively charged Tau is condensed by cytosolic polyanions. However, this hypothesis is likely based on an overestimation of the abundance and stability of cytosolic polyanions and an underestimation of crucial intracellular constituents - the cationic polyamines. Here, we propose an alternative mechanism grounded in cellular biology. We describe extensive molecular dynamics simulations and analysis on physiologically relevant model systems, which suggest that it is not positively charged, unmodified Tau that is condensed by cytosolic polyanions but negatively charged, hyperphosphorylated Tau that is condensed by cytosolic polycations. Our work has broad implications for anti-Alzheimer's research and drug development and the broader field of tauopathies in general, potentially paving the way to future etiologic therapies.",

The spread of tau aggregates (neurofibrillary tangles) across the cerebral cortex parallels symptom severity2,3. We hypothesized that the kinetics of tau spread may vary if the properties of the propagating tau proteins vary across individuals. We carried out biochemical, biophysical, MS and both cell- and animal-based-bioactivity assays to characterize tau in 32 patients with AD. We found striking patient-to-patient heterogeneity in the hyperphosphorylated species of soluble, oligomeric, seed-competent tau. Tau seeding activity correlates with the aggressiveness of the clinical disease, and some post-translational modification (PTM) sites appear to be associated with both enhanced seeding activity and worse clinical outcomes, whereas others are not. These data suggest that different individuals with 'typical' AD may have distinct biochemical features of tau. These data are consistent with the possibility that individuals with AD, much like people with cancer, may have multiple molecular drivers of an otherwise common phenotype, and emphasize the potential for personalized therapeutic approaches for slowing clinical progression of AD.",

We performed a genome-wide association study to examine rate of cognitive decline (ROD) in patients with AD. METHODS: We tested for interactions between genetic variants and time since diagnosis to predict the ROD of a composite cognitive score in 3946 AD cases and performed pathway analysis on the top genes. RESULTS: Suggestive associations (P < 1.0 x 10-6 ) were observed on chromosome 15 in DNA polymerase-gamma (rs3176205, P = 1.11 x 10-7 ), chromosome 7 (rs60465337,P = 4.06 x 10-7 ) in contactin-associated protein-2, in RP11-384F7.1 on chromosome 3 (rs28853947, P = 5.93 x 10-7 ), family with sequence similarity 214 member-A on chromosome 15 (rs2899492, P = 5.94 x 10-7 ), and intergenic regions on chromosomes 16 (rs4949142, P = 4.02 x 10-7 ) and 4 (rs1304013, P = 7.73 x 10-7 ).

METHODS: We used NeuroToolKit and Elecsys  immunoassays to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta (Abeta)42, Abeta40, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), total tau (t-tau), neurofilament light (NfL), neurogranin, sTREM2, YKL40, GFAP, IL6, S100, and alpha-synuclein in cognitively unimpaired participants of the ALFA+ study, many within the Alzheimer's continuum. RESULTS: CSF t-tau, p-tau, and neurogranin increase throughout aging only in Abeta-positive individuals, whereas NfL and glial biomarkers increase with aging regardless of Abeta status. We modelled biomarker changes as a function of CSF Abeta42/40, p-tau and p-tau/Abeta42 as proxies of disease progression. The first change observed in the Alzheimer's continuum was a decrease in the CSF Abeta42/40 ratio. This is followed by a steep increase in CSF p-tau; t-tau; neurogranin; and, to a lesser extent, in NfL and glial biomarkers. DISCUSSION: Multiple biological pathways are altered and could be targeted very early in the Alzheimer's continuum.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the biological function of amyloid beta (Abeta) precursor protein (APP) beyond its role in Alzheimer's disease is emerging. Yet, its function during embryonic development is poorly understood. The zebrafish APP orthologue, Appb, is strongly expressed during early development but thus far has only been studied via morpholino-mediated knockdown. Zebrafish enables analysis of cellular processes in an ontogenic context, which is limited in many other vertebrates. We characterized zebrafish carrying a homozygous mutation that introduces a premature stop in exon 2 of the appb gene. We report that appb mutants are significantly smaller until 2 dpf and display perturbed enveloping layer (EVL) integrity and cell protrusions at the blastula stage. Moreover, appb mutants surviving beyond 48 hpf exhibited no behavioral defects at 6 dpf and developed into healthy and fertile adults. The expression of the app family member, appa, was also found to be altered in appb mutants. Taken together, we show that appb is involved in the initial development of zebrafish by supporting the integrity of the EVL, likely by mediating cell adhesion properties. The loss of Appb might then be compensated for by other app family members to maintain normal development.",

In mouse models of amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation, defective TREM2 function affects microglial response to Abeta plaques, exacerbating tissue damage, whereas TREM2 overexpression attenuates pathology. Thus, AD may benefit from TREM2 activation. Here, we examined the impact of an anti-human TREM2 agonistic mAb, AL002c, in a mouse AD model expressing either the common variant (CV) or the R47H variant of TREM2. Single-cell RNA-seq of microglia after acute systemic administration of AL002c showed induction of proliferation in both CV- and R47H-transgenic mice. Prolonged administration of AL002c reduced filamentous plaques and neurite dystrophy, impacted behavior, and tempered microglial inflammatory response. We further showed that a variant of AL002c is safe and well tolerated in a first-in-human phase I clinical trial and engages TREM2 based on cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. We conclude that AL002 is a promising candidate for AD therapy.",

A key insight has been an increase in soluble Abeta oligomers in early AD that is causally linked to neuronal and circuit hyperexcitability. However, other accumulating AD-related peptides and proteins, including those derived from the same amyloid precursor protein, such as Aeta or sAPPalpha, and autonomously, such as tau, exhibit surprising opposing effects on circuit dynamics. We propose that the effects of these on neuronal circuits have profound implications for our understanding of disease complexity and heterogeneity and for the development of personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in AD.

P-glycoprotein (P-gp) as a member of ABC transporter family situated in blood brain barrier (BBB) plays a role on cleaning of Abeta via its efflux transport effect in the treatment of AD. However, the expression of P-gp in pathological BBB was lower than that in normal BBB, thus impeding the clearance of Abeta. Here, we used human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMVECs) derived exosomes (HBMVECs-Ex) inheriting P-gp as an extracorporeal Abeta cleansing system to remove Abeta peptides from the brain by specific capture between P-gp and Abeta. The results showed that HBMVECs-Ex inheriting P-gp greatly facilitated the cerebral clearance of Abeta by effectively transporting Abeta out of brain and potently ameliorated cognitive dysfunction in AD mice.

Using X-ray spectromicroscopy and electron microscopy we found that the co-aggregation of Abeta and ferritin resulted in the conversion of ferritin's inert ferric core into more reactive low-oxidation-states. Such findings strongly implicate Abeta in the altered iron handling and increased oxidative stress observed in AD pathogenesis.

However, the structure and consequences of the formation of these complexes remains to be determined. The main objective of this study was to characterise the different types and morphology of Abeta-hIAPP heterocomplexes and determine if formation of such complexes exacerbate neurotoxicity. We demonstrate that hIAPP promotes Abeta oligomerization and formation of small oligomer and large aggregate heterocomplexes. Co-oligomerized Abeta42-hIAPP mixtures displayed distinct amorphous structures and a 3-fold increase in neuronal cell death as compared to Abeta and hIAPP alone. However, in contrast to hIAPP, non-amyloidogenic rat amylin (rIAPP) reduced oligomer Abeta-mediated neuronal cell death. rIAPP exhibited reductions in Abeta induced neuronal cell death that was independent of its ability to interact with Abeta and form heterocomplexes; suggesting mediation by other pathways. Our findings reveal distinct effects of IAPP peptides in modulating Abeta aggregation and toxicity and provide new insight into the potential pathogenic effects of Abeta-IAPP hetero-oligomerization and development of IAPP based therapies for AD and T2D.",

    "title": "An agnostic reevaluation of the amyloid cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis: The role of APP homeostasis.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To reassess the role of amyloid beta (Abeta) and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) system in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). BACKGROUND: APP is a cell adhesion molecule that has been highly conserved over the course of phylogeny that has critical roles in brain development, synaptic plasticity, and the brain's intrinsic immune system. The amyloid cascade hypothesis describes a relatively linear, deterministic sequence of events triggered by a gain of Abeta peptide fragment toxicity that results in neurodegeneration and cognitive loss, yet well designed immunotherapy and beta secretase inhibitor trials that have successfully targeted Abeta have failed to have any consistent effects on the steady decline of cognition. NEW/UPDATED HYPOTHESIS: Mutations of the APP and presenilin genes not only alter the ratio of longer to shorter Abeta fragments (resulting in a gain of Abeta toxicity), but also disrupt the normal homeostatic roles of their respective proteins. The evolutionary history, physiological importance, and complexity of the APP and presenilin systems, as well as other critical components including tau and apolipoprotein E (APOE) imply that altered function of such systems could have severe consequences that include but need not be limited to a gain of Abeta toxicity and would more generally result in altered homeostasis of APP-related functions. MAJOR CHALLENGES ADDRESSED BY OUR HYPOTHESIS: Challenges that a loss of APP homeostasis addresses better than the more limited gain of Abeta toxicity model include the topographic mismatches between Abeta and tau pathology, the profile and chronology of cognitive and biomarker changes that precede the clinical expression of mild cognitive impairment and dementia, and the disappointments of Abeta targeted therapeutics among others. LINKAGE TO OTHER MAJOR THEORIES: The importance of APP, alpha- and beta-secretases, the presenilins and gamma-secretase, as well as tau was recognized by the authors of the amyloid cascade hypothesis, and has since led multiple investigators to propose alternative, more balanced hypotheses including reduced homeostasis and frank loss-of-function of key components that include but go beyond the currently envisioned linear model of Abeta toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Sex differences in the manifestations of Alzheimer's disease are under intense investigation. Despite the emerging importance of polygenic predictions for Alzheimer's disease, sex-dependent polygenic effects have not been demonstrated. Here, using a sex crossover analysis, we show that sex-dependent autosomal genetic effects on Alzheimer's disease can be revealed by characterizing disease progress via the hazard function. We first performed sex-stratified genome-wide associations, and then applied derived sex-dependent weights to two independent cohorts. Relative to sex-mismatched scores, sex-matched polygenic hazard scores showed significantly stronger associations with age-at-disease-onset, clinical progression, amyloid deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and composite neuropathological scores, independent of apolipoprotein E. Models without using hazard weights, i.e. polygenic risk scores, showed lower predictive power than polygenic hazard scores with no evidence for sex differences. Our results indicate that revealing sex-dependent genetic architecture requires the consideration of temporal processes of Alzheimer's disease. This has strong implications not only for the genetic underpinning of Alzheimer's disease but also for how we estimate sex-dependent polygenic effects for clinical use.",

    "abstract": "Plasma levels of biomarkers change with the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which involves the accumulation of pathological amyloid beta (Abeta) and Tau protein tangles. However, few studies have investigated the association between plasma biomarkers and rapid cognitive decline in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and AD. A total of 10 healthy controls, 24 patients with aMCI, and 19 patients with AD were enrolled. All participants underwent twice Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), with a mean 1.2 year interval. Immunomagnetic reduction was utilized to evaluate levels of plasma biomarkers, including amyloid beta 1-40 (Abeta1-40), Abeta1-42, total Tau protein, phosphorylated Tau protein (Threonine 181), and alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn). The correlations between plasma levels of biomarkers and MMSE change were examined. Our analysis reveals that current higher plasma levels of Abeta1-42 and alpha-Syn with the cut-off value of plasma Abeta1-42 >17.26 pg/mL and alpha-Syn >105 fg/mL had a moderate-to-high discriminatory capacity (area under the curve >0.70) for identifying cognitive deterioration in patients with aMCI. Our results thus suggest that plasma levels of Abeta1-42 and alpha-Syn may be considered as useful markers to assess the severity of global cognitive decline in patients with aMCI.",

    "title": "Clinical and biomarker changes of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down syndrome: a cross-sectional study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease and its complications are the leading cause of death in adults with Down syndrome. Studies have assessed Alzheimer's disease in individuals with Down syndrome, but the natural history of biomarker changes in Down syndrome has not been established. We characterised the order and timing of changes in biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in a population of adults with Down syndrome. METHODS: We did a dual-centre cross-sectional study of adults with Down syndrome recruited through a population-based health plan in Barcelona (Spain) and through services for people with intellectual disabilities in Cambridge (UK). Cognitive impairment in participants with Down syndrome was classified with the Cambridge Cognitive Examination for Older Adults with Down Syndrome (CAMCOG-DS). Only participants with mild or moderate disability were included who had at least one of the following Alzheimer's disease measures: apolipoprotein E allele carrier status; plasma concentrations of amyloid beta peptides 1-42 and 1-40 and their ratio (Abeta1-42/1-40), total tau protein, and neurofilament light chain (NFL); tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau), and NFL in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); and one or more of PET with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, PET with amyloid tracers, and MRI. Cognitively healthy euploid controls aged up to 75 years who had no biomarker abnormalities were recruited from the Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration. We used a first-order locally estimated scatterplot smoothing curve to determine the order and age at onset of the biomarker changes, and the lowest ages at the divergence with 95% CIs are also reported where appropriate. FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, 2013, and June 28, 2019 (Barcelona), and between June 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2014 (Cambridge), we included 388 participants with Down syndrome (257 [66%] asymptomatic, 48 [12%] with prodromal Alzheimer's disease, and 83 [21%] with Alzheimer's disease dementia) and 242 euploid controls. CSF Abeta1-42/1-40 and plasma NFL values changed in individuals with Down syndrome as early as the third decade of life, and amyloid PET uptake changed in the fourth decade. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET and CSF p-tau changes occurred later in the fourth decade of life, followed by hippocampal atrophy and changes in cognition in the fifth decade of life. Prodromal Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed at a median age of 50 2 years (IQR 47 5-54 1), and Alzheimer's disease dementia at 53 7 years (49 5-57 2). Symptomatic Alzheimer's disease prevalence increased with age in individuals with Down syndrome, reaching 90-100% in the seventh decade of life. INTERPRETATION: Alzheimer's disease in individuals with Down syndrome has a long preclinical phase in which biomarkers follow a predictable order of changes over more than two decades. The similarities with sporadic and autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease and the prevalence of Down syndrome make this population a suitable target for Alzheimer's disease preventive treatments.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glutathione (GSH) is an important endogenous antioxidant protecting cells from oxidative injury. Cysteine (Cys), the substrate limiting the production of GSH, is mainly generated from the trans-sulfuration pathway. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is a critical molecule produced in the methionine cycle and can be utilized by the trans-sulfuration pathway. Reductions in GSH and SAM as well as dysfunction in the trans-sulfuration pathway have been documented in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Our previous in vivo study revealed that SAM administration attenuated oxidative stress induced by amyloid-beta (Abeta) through the enhancement of GSH. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Abeta-induced oxidative stress on the trans-sulfuration pathway in astrocytes and neurons, respectively, and the protective effect of SAM on neurons. METHODS: APP/PS1 transgenic mice and the primary cultured astrocytes, neurons, and HT22 cells were used in the current study. RESULTS: SAM could rescue the low trans-sulfuration pathway activity induced by Abeta only in astrocytes, accompanying with increasing levels of Cys and GSH. The decrease of cellular viability of neurons caused by Abeta was greatly reversed when co-cultured with astrocytes with SAM intervention. Meanwhile, SAM improved cognitive performance in APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSION: In terms of astrocyte protection from oxidative stress, SAM might be a potent antioxidant in the therapy of AD patients.",

    "abstract": "Importance: Indicators of early-life cognitive enrichment (ELCE) have been associated with slower cognitive decline and decreased dementia in late life. However, the mechanisms underlying this association have not been elucidated. Objective: To examine the association of ELCE with late-life Alzheimer disease (AD) and other common dementia-related pathological changes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This clinical-pathological community-based cohort study, the Rush Memory and Aging Project, followed up participants before death for a mean (SD) of 7.0 (3.8) years with annual cognitive and clinical assessments. From January 1, 1997, through June 30, 2019, 2044 participants enrolled, of whom 1018 died. Postmortem data were leveraged from 813 participants. Data were analyzed from April 12, 2019, to February 20, 2020. Exposures: Four indicators of ELCE (early-life socioeconomic status, availability of cognitive resources at 12 years of age, frequency of participation in cognitively stimulating activities, and early-life foreign language instruction) were obtained by self-report at the study baseline, from which a composite measure of ELCE was derived. Main Outcomes and Measures: A continuous global AD pathology score derived from counts of diffuse plaques, neuritic plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. Results: The 813 participants included in the analysis had a mean (SD) age of 90.1 (6.3) years at the time of death, and 562 (69%) were women. In a linear regression model controlled for age at death, sex, and educational level, a higher level of ELCE was associated with a lower global AD pathology score (estimate, -0.057; standard error, 0.022; P = .01). However, ELCE was not associated with any other dementia-related pathological changes. In addition, a higher level of ELCE was associated with less cognitive decline (mean [SD], -0.13 [0.19] units per year; range, -1.74 to 0.85). An indirect effect through AD pathological changes constituted 20% of the association between ELCE and the rate of late-life cognitive decline, and 80% was a direct association. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ELCE was associated with better late-life cognitive health, in part through an association with fewer AD pathological changes.",

    "title": "Chronic copper exposure directs microglia towards degenerative expression signatures in wild-type and J20 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Copper (Cu) is an essential metal mediating a variety of vital biological reactions with its redox property. Its dyshomeostasis has been associated with accelerated cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, underlying neurotoxic mechanisms elicited by dysregulated Cu remain largely elusive. We and others previously demonstrated that exposure to Cu in drinking water significantly exacerbated pathological hallmarks of AD and pro-inflammatory activation of microglia, coupled with impaired phagocytic capacity, in mouse models of AD. METHODS: In the present study, we extended our investigation to evaluate whether chronic Cu exposure to wild-type (WT) and J20 mouse model of AD perturbs homeostatic dynamics of microglia and contributes to accelerated transformation of microglia towards degenerative phenotypes that are closely associated with neurodegeneration. We further looked for evidence of alterations in the microglial morphology and spatial memory of the Cu-exposed mice to assess the extent of the Cu toxicity. RESULTS: We find that chronic Cu exposure to pre-pathological J20 mice upregulates the translation of degenerative genes and represses homeostatic genes within microglia even in the absence amyloid-beta plaques. We also observe similar expression signatures in Cu-exposed WT mice, suggesting that excess Cu exposure alone could lead to perturbed microglial homeostatic phenotypes and contribute to accelerated cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the risk of chronic Cu exposure on cognitive decline and altered microglia activation towards degenerative phenotypes. These changes may represent one of the key mechanisms linking Cu exposure or its dyshomeostasis to an increased risk for AD.",

    "abstract": "A major obstacle to treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) is our lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying selective neuronal vulnerability, a key characteristic of the disease. Here, we present a framework integrating high-quality neuron-type-specific molecular profiles across the lifetime of the healthy mouse, which we generated using bacTRAP, with postmortem human functional genomics and quantitative genetics data. We demonstrate human-mouse conservation of cellular taxonomy at the molecular level for neurons vulnerable and resistant in AD, identify specific genes and pathways associated with AD neuropathology, and pinpoint a specific functional gene module underlying selective vulnerability, enriched in processes associated with axonal remodeling, and affected by amyloid accumulation and aging. We have made all cell-type-specific profiles and functional networks available at http://alz.princeton.edu.

    "title": "Associative memory and in vivo brain pathology in asymptomatic presenilin-1 E280A carriers.",
    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether performance on the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) is associated with PET in vivo markers of brain pathology and whether it can distinguish those who will develop dementia later in life due to autosomal-dominant Alzheimer disease (AD) from age-matched controls. METHODS: Twenty-four cognitively unimpaired Presenilin-1 E280A carriers (mean age 36 years) and 28 noncarriers (mean age 37 years) underwent Pittsburg compound B-PET (amyloid), flortaucipir-PET (tau), and cognitive testing, including the FCSRT (immediate and delayed free and cued recall scores). Linear regressions were used to examine the relationships among FCSRT scores, age, mean cortical amyloid, and regional tau burden. RESULTS: Free and total recall scores did not differ between cognitively unimpaired mutation carriers and noncarriers. Greater age predicted lower free recall and delayed free and total recall scores in carriers. In cognitively impaired carriers, delayed free recall predicted greater amyloid burden and entorhinal tau, while worse immediate free recall scores predicted greater tau in the inferior temporal and entorhinal cortices. In turn, in all carriers, lower free and total recall scores predicted greater amyloid and regional tau pathology. CONCLUSIONS: FCSRT scores were associated with in vivo markers of AD-related pathology in cognitively unimpaired individuals genetically determined to develop dementia. Difficulties on free recall, particularly delayed recall, were evident earlier in the disease trajectory, while difficulties on cued recall were seen only as carriers neared the onset of dementia, consistent with the pathologic progression of the disease. Findings suggest that the FCSRT can be a useful measure to track disease progression in AD.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine changes in the incidence of dementia between 1988 and 2015. METHODS: This analysis was performed in aggregated data from individuals >65 years of age in 7 population-based cohort studies in the United States and Europe from the Alzheimer Cohort Consortium. First, we calculated age- and sex-specific incidence rates for all-cause dementia, and then defined nonoverlapping 5-year epochs within each study to determine trends in incidence. Estimates of change per 10-year interval were pooled and results are presented combined and stratified by sex. RESULTS: Of 49,202 individuals, 4,253 (8.6%) developed dementia. The incidence rate of dementia increased with age, similarly for women and men, ranging from about 4 per 1,000 person-years in individuals aged 65-69 years to 65 per 1,000 person-years for those aged 85-89 years. The incidence rate of dementia declined by 13% per calendar decade (95% confidence interval [CI], 7%-19%), consistently across studies, and somewhat more pronouncedly in men than in women (24% [95% CI 14%-32%] vs 8% [0%-15%]). CONCLUSION: The incidence rate of dementia in Europe and North America has declined by 13% per decade over the past 25 years, consistently across studies. Incidence is similar for men and women, although declines were somewhat more profound in men. These observations call for sustained efforts to finding the causes for this decline, as well as determining their validity in geographically and ethnically diverse populations.",

    "abstract": "Synapse remodeling is essential to encode experiences into neuronal circuits. Here, we define a molecular interaction between neurons and microglia that drives experience-dependent synapse remodeling in the hippocampus. We find that the cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) is expressed by adult hippocampal neurons in an experience-dependent manner and defines a neuronal subset primed for synaptic plasticity. Loss of neuronal IL-33 or the microglial IL-33 receptor leads to impaired spine plasticity, reduced newborn neuron integration, and diminished precision of remote fear memories. Memory precision and neuronal IL-33 are decreased in aged mice, and IL-33 gain of function mitigates age-related decreases in spine plasticity. We find that neuronal IL-33 instructs microglial engulfment of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and that its loss leads to impaired ECM engulfment and a concomitant accumulation of ECM proteins in contact with synapses. These data define a cellular mechanism through which microglia regulate experience-dependent synapse remodeling and promote memory consolidation.",

    "abstract": "Garcinoic acid (GA or delta-T3-13'COOH), is a natural vitamin E metabolite that has preliminarily been identified as a modulator of nuclear receptors involved in beta-amyloid (Abeta) metabolism and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we investigated GA's effects on Abeta oligomer formation and deposition. Specifically, we compared them with those of other vitamin E analogs and the soy isoflavone genistein, a natural agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) that has therapeutic potential for managing AD. GA significantly reduced Abeta aggregation and accumulation in mouse cortical astrocytes. Similarly to genistein, GA up-regulated PPARgamma expression and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) efflux in these cells with an efficacy that was comparable with that of its metabolic precursor delta-tocotrienol and higher than those of alpha-tocopherol metabolites. Unlike for genistein and the other vitamin E compounds, the GA-induced restoration of ApoE efflux was not affected by pharmacological inhibition of PPARgamma activity, and specific activation of pregnane X receptor (PXR) was observed together with ApoE and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) membrane transporter up-regulation in both the mouse astrocytes and brain tissue. These effects of GA were associated with reduced Abeta deposition in the brain of TgCRND8 mice, a transgenic AD model. In conclusion, GA holds potential for preventing Abeta oligomerization and deposition in the brain. The mechanistic aspects of GA's properties appear to be distinct from those of other vitamin E metabolites and of genistein.",

    "abstract": "Melatonin is a tryptophan metabolite synthesized by the pineal gland. Recent research showed that melatonin has a protective effect in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, its exact mechanism is still unclear. This study was designed to investigate the effects of long-term oral melatonin on spatial learning and memory, Abeta deposition and soluble Abeta levels, amyloidogenic amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, mitochondrial structure and mitophagy in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, a model of AD. The spatial learning and memory ability of mice were examined by using the Morris water maze. Thioflavin S staining was used to observe Abeta deposition. ELISA was used to evaluate the levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42. The expression levels of mitophagy proteins (PINK1, Parkin, LC3-II and LC3-I) and amyloidogenic APP processing proteins (BACE1, APP and CTFbeta) were examined by western blotting analysis. Finally, transmission electron microscopy was used to observe mitochondrial structure and mitophagy vesicles. Our results showed that APP/PS1 transgenic mice with long-term oral melatonin showed improved spatial learning, alleviated memory impairment, reduced Abeta deposition and restrained damage of mitochondrial structure. In addition, the number of mitophagy vesicles and expression levels of mitophagy factors (PINK1, Parkin, LC3-II/LC3-I) were decreased, as was the expression levels of amyloidogenic APP processing proteins (BACE1, APP and CTFbeta). Long-term oral melatonin decreased Abeta deposition and improved spatial learning and memory in APP/PS1 transgenic mice by a mechanism associated with down-regulation of BACE1 and mitophagy.",

The Abeta and tau proteins, and the alpha-synuclein protein, key players in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, respectively are fully disordered at the monomer level. The structural heterogeneity of the monomeric and oligomeric states and the high self-assembly propensity of these three IDPs have precluded experimental structural determination. Simulations have been used to determine the atomic structures of these IDPs.

    "abstract": "Soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (oAbeta42)-induced neuronal death and inflammation response has been recognized as one of the major causes of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this work, a novel strategy adopting silica-coated iron oxide stir bar (MSB)-based AD therapy system via magnetic stirring-induced capture of oAbeta42 into magnetic plaques (mpAbeta42) and activation of microglia on cellular plaque clearance was developed. With oAbeta42 being effectively converted into mpAbeta42, the neurotoxicity toward neuronal cells was thus greatly reduced. In addition to the good preservation of neurite outgrowth through the diminished uptake of oAbeta42, neurons treated with oAbeta42 under magnetic stirring also exhibited comparable neuron-specific protein expression to those in the absence of oAbeta42. The phagocytic uptake of mpAbeta42 by microglia was enhanced significantly as compared to the counterpart of oAbeta42, and the M1 polarization of microglia often occurring after the uptake of oAbeta42 restricted to an appreciable extent. As a result, the inflammation induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines was greatly alleviated.",

Structured illumination microscopy revealed single gamma-secretase complexes with a monodisperse distribution and in a 1:1 stoichiometry of PSEN1 and nicastrin subunits. In living cells, sptPALM revealed PSEN1/gamma-secretase mainly with directed motility and frequenting 'hotspots' or high track-density areas that are sensitive to gamma-secretase inhibitors. We visualized gamma-secretase association with substrates like amyloid precursor protein and N-cadherin, but not with its sheddases ADAM10 or BACE1 at the cell surface, arguing against pre-formed megadalton complexes. Nonetheless, in living cells PSEN1/gamma-secretase transiently visits ADAM10 hotspots.

The evaluation of Abeta, tau, and neurodegenerative (A/T/N) biomarkers has been proposed for classifying AD. However, it remains unclear whether disturbances in each arm of the A/T/N framework contribute equally throughout the progression of AD. Here, using the random forest machine learning method to analyze participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, we show that A/T/N biomarkers show varying importance in predicting AD development, with elevated biomarkers of Abeta and tau better predicting early dementia status, and biomarkers of neurodegeneration, especially glucose hypometabolism, better predicting later dementia status. Our results suggest that AD treatments may also need to be disease stage-oriented with Abeta and tau as targets in early AD and glucose metabolism as a target in later AD.",

At the conclusion of a half century since Eanes and Glenner's seminal study of amyloids in humans, this review commemorates the occasion by documenting the major milestones in amyloid research to date, from the perspectives of structural biology, biophysics, medicine, microbiology, engineering and nanotechnology.

    "abstract": "Despite clinical evidence indicating a close relationship between olfactory dysfunction and Alzheimer's disease (AD), further investigations are warranted to determine the diagnostic potential of nasal surrogate biomarkers for AD. In this study, we first identified soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta), the key biomarker of AD, in patient nasal discharge using proteomic analysis. Then, we profiled the significant differences in Abeta oligomers level between patient groups with mild or moderate cognitive decline (n = 39) and an age-matched normal control group (n = 21) by immunoblot analysis and comparing the levels of Abeta by a self-standard method with interdigitated microelectrode sensor systems. All subjects received the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) for grouping. We observed higher levels of Abeta oligomers in probable AD subjects with lower MMSE, higher CDR, and higher GDS compared to the normal control group. Moreover, mild and moderate subject groups could be distinguished based on the increased composition of two oligomers, 12-mer Abeta*56 and 15-mer AbetaO, respectively. The longitudinal cohort study confirmed that the cognitive decline of mild AD patients with high nasal discharge Abeta*56 levels advanced to the moderate stage within three years. Our clinical evidence strongly supports the view that the presence of oligomeric Abeta proteins in nasal discharge is a potential surrogate biomarker of AD and an indicator of cognitive decline progression.",

    "abstract": "In metazoans, the secreted proteome participates in intercellular signalling and innate immunity, and builds the extracellular matrix scaffold around cells. Compared with the relatively constant intracellular environment, conditions for proteins in the extracellular space are harsher, and low concentrations of ATP prevent the activity of intracellular components of the protein quality-control machinery. Until now, only a few bona fide extracellular chaperones and proteases have been shown to limit the aggregation of extracellular proteins1-5. Here we performed a systematic analysis of the extracellular proteostasis network in Caenorhabditis elegans with an RNA interference screen that targets genes that encode the secreted proteome. We discovered 57 regulators of extracellular protein aggregation, including several proteins related to innate immunity. Because intracellular proteostasis is upregulated in response to pathogens6-9, we investigated whether pathogens also stimulate extracellular proteostasis. Using a pore-forming toxin to mimic a pathogenic attack, we found that C. elegans responded by increasing the expression of components of extracellular proteostasis and by limiting aggregation of extracellular proteins. The activation of extracellular proteostasis was dependent on stress-activated MAP kinase signalling. Notably, the overexpression of components of extracellular proteostasis delayed ageing and rendered worms resistant to intoxication. We propose that enhanced extracellular proteostasis contributes to systemic host defence by maintaining a functional secreted proteome and avoiding proteotoxicity.",

Understanding heterogeneity and longitudinal progression of atrophy during the disease course will play a key role in understanding AD pathogenesis. We propose a framework for longitudinal clustering that simultaneously: 1) incorporates whole brain data, 2) leverages unequal visits per individual, 3) compares clusters with a control group, 4) allows for study confounding effects, 5) provides cluster visualization, 6) measures clustering uncertainty. We used amyloid-beta positive AD and negative healthy subjects, three longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging scans (cortical thickness and subcortical volume) over two years. We found three distinct longitudinal AD brain atrophy patterns: one typical diffuse pattern (n=34, 47.2%), and two atypical patterns: minimal atrophy (n=23 31.9%) and hippocampal sparing (n=9, 12.5%). We also identified outliers (n=3, 4.2%) and observations with uncertain classification (n=3, 4.2%). The clusters differed not only in regional distributions of atrophy at baseline, but also longitudinal atrophy progression, age at AD onset, and cognitive decline. A framework for the longitudinal assessment of variability in cohorts with several neuroimaging measures was successfully developed. We believe this framework may aid in disentangling distinct subtypes of AD from disease staging.",

Moreover, a series of 4-substituted sampangine derivatives have been investigated as inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase and beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation for the treatment of AD in our previous studies. In the present study, we reported that one of these derivatives SD-1 was able to modulate Cu2+-mediated multiple pathological elements in AD. The high selectivity of SD-1 for Cu2+ over other biologically relevant metal ions was demonstrated by ITC. Western blotting analysis, light-scattering study, DCF-DA assay and paralysis experiment indicated that SD-1 suppressed the formation of Cu2+-Abeta species, alleviated the Cu2+-Abeta species induced neurotoxicity and inhibited the production of ROS catalyzed by Cu2+-Abeta species in SH-SY5Y cells over-expressing the Swedish mutant form of human APP (APPsw SH-SY5Y) and Abeta42 transgenic C elegans (CL2020). Furthermore, SD-1 inhibited the expressions of NO, iNOS, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 induced by Cu2+ in BV2 microglial cells.

This nonhuman primate, comparable to humans, naturally develops tau and amyloid-beta proteopathies during aging. Whether these are linked to cognitive alterations is unknown. Here, standardized cognitive testing in pairwise discrimination and reversal learning in a sample of 37 aged (>5 years) subjects was combined with tau and amyloid-beta histochemistry in individuals that died naturally. Correlation analyses in successfully tested subjects (n = 22) revealed a significant relation between object discrimination learning and age, strongly influenced by outliers, suggesting pathological cases. Where neuroimmunohistochemistry was possible, as subjects deceased, the naturally developed cortical amyloid-beta burden was significantly linked to pretraining success (intraneuronal accumulations) and discrimination learning (extracellular deposits), showing that cognitive (pairwise discrimination) performance in old age predicts the natural accumulation of amyloid-beta at death. This is the first description of a direct relation between the cortical amyloid-beta burden and cognition in a nonhuman primate.",

Most of compounds were found to be selective and highly potent hMAO-B inhibitors showing IC50 values in the nanomolar, and exhibited a moderate inhibition of amyloid-beta aggregation. 7-((5-(methyl(prop-2-yn-1-yl)amino) pentyl)oxy)chroman-4-one (6j) was the most interesting compound identified in this research, endowed with higher hMAO-B potency (IC50 = 4 nM) and selectivity (SI > 25000) compared to the reference selective inhibitor rasagiline (IC50 = 141 nM, SI > 355), and exhibited good inhibitory activity against Abeta1-42 aggregation (40.78%, 25 muM). Kinetic and molecular modeling studies revealed that 6j was a competitive reversible inhibitor for hMAO-B. Moreover, compound 6j displayed low toxicity and good neuroprotective effects in SH-SY5Y cell assay, and could penetrate the blood-brain barrier according to the parallel artificial membrane permeability assay. Pharmacokinetics assay revealed that compound 6j possessed good pharmacokinetic profiles after intravenous and oral administrations. Overall, these results highlighted that compound 6j was an effective and promising multitarget agent against Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease: Multiple interacting causes against which amyloid precursor protein protects.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is the commonest form of senile dementia. It is characterised by neuronal cell death and amyloid deposition. Amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is highly conserved in evolution, is expressed in neurones in response to a wide range of damaging agents. The hypothesis proposed is that APP has a protective function to counter damage but if it fails and the neurone dies then breakdown products of APP miss-fold and lead to amyloid deposition. This fits with the evidence that amyloid deposition is a consequence rather than a cause of cell death. Germ line mutations in APP impair the protective role and lead to increased neuronal loss in response to damage. This leads to early onset and severe Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation, infection, hypoxia, trauma and pollution are damaging agents which interact to cause the disease. The bacteria which cause chronic periodontitis appear to have a significant role. Prevention needs to focus on avoiding trauma, reducing pollution and improving dental hygiene. Furthermore we should attempt to optimise the oral microbial flora by suppressing the growth of pathogenic bacteria that cause gum disease and the bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx that cause life threatening infections following viral upper respiratory infections. This leads to a key research question: does the regular consumption of natural live yoghurt reduce the carriage of periodontal and oropharyngeal bacterial pathogens? Theoretical considerations indicate it should and if so regular natural live yoghurt consumption could be an important preventive agent.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, involves misfolding and aggregation of the extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein where the intermediate oligomers, formed during the aggregation progression cascade, are considered the prime toxic species. Here, we identify an active peptide fragment from a medicinal plant-derived (Aristolochia indica) fibrinolytic enzyme having anti-amyloidogenic effects against Abeta fibrillation and toxicity. Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), followed by computational analysis of the peptide pool generated by proteolytic digestion of the enzyme, identifies two peptide sequences with predictive high-propensity binding to Abeta42. Microscopic visualizations in conjunction with biochemical and biophysical assessments suggest that the synthetic version of one of the peptides (termed here Pactive, GFLLHQK) arrests Abeta molecules in off-pathway oligomers that can no longer participate in the cytotoxic fibrillation pathway. In contrast, the other peptide (termed P1) aggravates the fibrillation process. Further investigations confirm the strong binding affinity of Pactive with both Abeta42 monomers and toxic oligomers by biolayer interferometric assays. We have also shown that, mechanistically, Pactive binding induces conformational alterations in the Abeta molecule along with modification of Abeta hydrophobicity, one of the key players in aggregation. Importantly, the biostability of Pactive in human blood serum and its nontoxic nature make it a promising therapeutic candidate against Alzheimer's, for which no disease-modifying treatments are available to date.",

In the present study, three peptide sequences were designed based on the hopeful results of LIAIMA peptide and molecular docking studies were carried out onto the monomer and fibril structure of amyloid beta peptide using AutoDock Vina software. According to the obtained interactions and binding energy from docking, the best-designed peptide (d-GABA-FPLIAIMA) was chosen and synthesized in great yield (%96) via the Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis. The synthesis and purity of the resulting peptide were estimated and evaluated by Mass spectroscopy and Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) methods, respectively. Stability studies in plasma and Thioflavin T (ThT) assay were performed in order to measure the binding affinity and in vitro aggregation inhibition of Abeta peptide. The d-GABA-FPLIAIMA peptide showed good binding energy and affinity to Abeta fibrils, high stability (more than 90%) in human serum, and a reduction of 20% in inhibition of the Abeta aggregation growth.

    "abstract": "Under the ATN framework, CSF analytes provide evidence of the presence or absence of Alzheimer's disease pathological hallmarks: amyloid plaques (A), phosphorylated tau (T), and accompanying neurodegeneration (N). Still, differences in CSF levels across amnestic and non-amnestic variants or due to co-occurring pathologies might lead to misdiagnoses. We assess the diagnostic accuracy of CSF markers for amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration in an autopsy cohort of 118 Alzheimer's disease patients (98 amnestic; 20 non-amnestic) and 64 frontotemporal lobar degeneration patients (five amnestic; 59 non-amnestic). We calculated between-group differences in CSF concentrations of amyloid-beta1-42 peptide, tau protein phosphorylated at threonine 181, total tau, and the ratio of phosphorylated tau to amyloid-beta1-42. Results show that non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease patients were less likely to be correctly classified under the ATN framework using independent, published biomarker cut-offs for positivity. Amyloid-beta1-42 did not differ between amnestic and non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease, and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses indicated that amyloid-beta1-42 was equally effective in discriminating both groups from frontotemporal lobar degeneration. However, CSF concentrations of phosphorylated tau, total tau, and the ratio of phosphorylated tau to amyloid-beta1-42 were significantly lower in non-amnestic compared to amnestic Alzheimer's disease patients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses for these markers showed reduced area under the curve when discriminating non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease from frontotemporal lobar degeneration, compared to discrimination of amnestic Alzheimer's disease from frontotemporal lobar degeneration. In addition, the ATN framework was relatively insensitive to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and these patients were likely to be classified as having normal biomarkers or biomarkers suggestive of primary Alzheimer's disease pathology. We conclude that amyloid-beta1-42 maintains high sensitivity to A status, although with lower specificity, and this single biomarker provides better sensitivity to non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease than either the ATN framework or the phosphorylated-tau/amyloid-beta1-42 ratio. In contrast, T and N status biomarkers differed between amnestic and non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease; standard cut-offs for phosphorylated tau and total tau may thus result in misclassifications for non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease patients. Consideration of clinical syndrome may help improve the accuracy of ATN designations for identifying true non-amnestic Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common causes of dementia. It is believed that the aggregation of short Abeta-peptides to form oligomeric and protofibrillar amyloid assemblies plays a central role for disease-relevant neurotoxicity. In recent years, passive immunotherapy has been introduced as a potential treatment strategy with anti-amyloid antibodies binding to Abeta-amyloids and inducing their subsequent degradation by the immune system. Although so far mostly unsuccessful in clinical studies, the high-dosed application of the monoclonal antibody Aducanumab has shown therapeutic potential that might be attributed to its much greater affinity to Abeta-aggregates vs monomeric Abeta-peptides. In order to better understand how Aducanumab interacts with aggregated Abeta-forms compared to monomers, we have generated structural model complexes based on the known structure of Aducanumab in complex with an Abeta2 - 7 -eptitope. Structural models of Aducanumab bound to full-sequence Abeta1 - 40 -monomers, oligomers, protofilaments and mature fibrils were generated and investigated using extensive molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the flexibility and possible additional interactions. Indeed, an aggregate-specific N-terminal binding motif was found in case of Aducanumab binding to oligomers, protofilaments and fibrils that is located next to but not overlapping with the epitope binding site found in the crystal structure with Abeta2 - 7 . Analysis of binding energetics indicates that this motif binds weaker than the epitope but likely contributes to Aducanumab's preference for aggregated Abeta-species. The predicted aggregate-specific binding motif could potentially serve as a basis to reengineer Aducanumab for further enhanced preference to bind Abeta-aggregates vs monomers.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal plaques of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides of varying length carrying different posttranslational modifications represent a molecular hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. It is believed that transient oligomeric Abeta assemblies associating in early fibrillation events represent particularly cytotoxic peptide aggregates. Also, N-terminally truncated (in position 3 or 11) and pyroglutamate modified peptides exhibited an increased toxicity compared to the wildtype. In the current study, the molecular structure of oligomeric species of pGlu3-Abeta(3-40) and pGlu11-Abeta(11-40) was investigated using solid-state NMR spectroscopy. On the secondary structure level, for both modified peptides a large similarity between oligomers and mature fibrils of the modified peptides was found mainly based on 13C NMR chemical shift data. Some smaller structural differences were detected in the vicinity of the respective modification site. Also, the crucial early folding molecular contact between residues Phe19 and Leu34 could be observed for the oligomers of both modified peptide species. Therefore, it has to be concluded that the major secondary structure elements of Abeta are already present in oligomers of pGlu3-Abeta(3-40) and pGlu11-Abeta(11-40). These posttranslationally modified peptides arrange in a similar fashion as observed for wild type Abeta(1-40).",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Higher late-life body mass index (BMI) was associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which might be explained by a reverse causal relationship. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether weight loss was a preclinical manifestation of AD pathologies and could be a predictor of cognitive impairment. METHODS: A total of 1,194 participants (mean age = 73.2 [range: 54 to 91] years, female = 44.5%) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were grouped according to AD biomarker profile as indicated by amyloid (A) and tau (TN) status and clinical stage by clinical dementia rating (CDR). BMI across the biomarker-defined clinical stages was compared with Bonferroni correction. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to test the relationship between the amyloid change by PET and the BMI change. Multiple regression models were used to explore the influences of amyloid pathologies on BMI change as well as the effects of weight loss on longitudinal changes of global cognitive function. RESULTS: BMI was significantly decreased in AD preclinical stage (amyloid positive [A+] and CDR = 0) and dementia stage (A+/TN+ and CDR = 0.5 or 1), compared with the healthy controls (A-/TN-and CDR = 0, p < 0.005), while no significant differences were observed between preclinical AD and AD dementia. Amyloid PET change was inversely correlated with BMI change (p = 0.023, beta= -14). Individuals in amyloid positive group exhibited faster weight loss (timexgroup interaction p = 0.019, beta= -0.20) compared to the amyloid negative group. Greater weight loss predicted higher risk of developing cognitive disorders. CONCLUSION: Elders who experienced greater weight loss might belong to preclinical stage of AD and could be targeted for primary prevention of the disease.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The neuroprotective role of interleukin (IL)-33 is supported by numerous preclinical studies, but it remains uninvestigated in clinical studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to examine the association between human blood levels of IL-33 and cognitive preservation in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and AD. METHODS: A total of 100 participants (26 controls, 35 aMCI patients, and 39 AD patients) completed two Mini-Mental State Examinations (MMSEs) over a 1-year interval. In all 100 participants at the second MMSE, we examined the plasma levels of IL-33, IL-beta, IL-1 receptor agonist (IL-1RA), beta amyloid (Abeta), and tau and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotyping; we also performed Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Trail Making Test, forward and backward digit span, and Clinical Dementia Rating. RESULTS: IL-33 expression showed a positive trend among controls (1/26 = 3.8%), aMCI (9/35 = 25.7%), and AD (17/39 = 43.6%) (trend analysis: P < 0.001). Patients expressing IL-33 preserved their cognitive function compared with IL-33 non-expressing patients (1-year DeltaMMSE, 0.16 +- 1.6 vs - 1.5 +- 2.6; P = 0.006). The cognitive preservation was not associated with the lower levels of Abeta, tau, and ApoE epsilon4, while higher levels of ApoE epsilon4 and phosphorylated tau were indeed associated with cognitive decline. The aMCI patients with AD conversion during study period had higher proportion of IL-33(-) than non-AD converters (90.9% vs 53.3%, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: IL-33 or its associated signaling pathways may represent a new treatment paradigm for aMCI and AD.",

    "abstract": "Manganese (Mn) produces cholinergic neuronal loss in basal forebrain (BF) region that was related to cognitive dysfunction induced after single and repeated Mn treatment. All processes that generate cholinergic neuronal loss in BF remain to be understood. Mn exposure may produce the reduction of BF cholinergic neurons by increasing amyloid beta (Abeta) and phosphorylated Tau (pTau) protein levels, altering heat shock proteins' (HSPs) expression, disrupting proteasome P20S activity and generating oxidative stress. These mechanisms, described to be altered by Mn in regions different than BF, could lead to the memory and learning process alteration produced after Mn exposure. The research performed shows that single and repeated Mn treatment of SN56 cholinergic neurons from BF induces P20S inhibition, increases Abeta and pTau protein levels, produces HSP90 and HSP70 proteins expression alteration, and oxidative stress generation, being the last two effects mediated by NRF2 pathway alteration. The increment of Abeta and pTau protein levels was mediated by HSPs and proteasome dysfunction. All these mechanisms mediated the cell decline observed after Mn treatment. Our results are relevant because they may assist to reveal the processes leading to the neurotoxicity and cognitive alterations observed after Mn exposure.",

    "title": "Blood cell-produced amyloid-beta induces cerebral Alzheimer-type pathologies and behavioral deficits.",
    "abstract": "It is traditionally believed that cerebral amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits are derived from the brain itself in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Peripheral cells such as blood cells also produce Abeta. The role of peripherally produced Abeta in the pathogenesis of AD remains unknown. In this study, we established a bone marrow transplantation model to investigate the contribution of blood cell-produced Abeta to AD pathogenesis. We found that bone marrow cells (BMCs) transplanted from APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice into wild-type (Wt) mice at 3 months of age continuously expressed human Abeta in the blood, and caused AD phenotypes including Abeta plaques, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), tau hyperphosphorylation, neuronal degeneration, neuroinflammation, and behavioral deficits in the Wt recipient mice at 12 months after transplantation. Bone marrow reconstitution in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice with Wt-BMCs at 3 months of age reduced blood Abeta levels, and alleviated brain Abeta burden, neuronal degeneration, neuroinflammation, and behavioral deficits in the AD model mice at 12 months after transplantation. Our study demonstrated that blood cell-produced Abeta plays a significant role in AD pathogenesis, and the elimination of peripheral production of Abeta can decrease brain Abeta deposition and represents a novel therapeutic approach for AD.",

Unwanted substances in the brain, including A beta, are generally removed by microglia, astrocytes, or neurons via a phagocytosis receptor. We observed that neurons and astrocytes engulfed A beta 42 and A beta 43, which are more neurotoxic than A beta 40. We previously showed that multiple-EGF like domains 10 (MEGF10) plays an important role in apoptotic cell elimination and is expressed in mammalian neurons and astrocytes. Therefore, we assessed whether MEGF10 is involved in A beta42 and A beta43 engulfment in MEGF10-expressing neurons and astrocytes. We found that MEGF10-expressing astrocytes and neurons engulfed A beta42 and A beta43 but not A beta40. Furthermore, incubation of the neurons and astrocytes with A beta42 and A beta43a ugmented MEGF10 phosphorylation; however, incubation with A beta40 did not have this augmenting effect. Our findings suggest that MEGF10 plays a phagocytosis receptor function for A beta42 and A beta43 in neurons and astrocytes.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by a chronic decline in cognitive function and is pathologically typified by cerebral deposition of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). The production of Abeta is mediated by sequential proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases, and has been implicated as the essential determinant of AD pathology. Previous studies have demonstrated that the level of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] in the membrane may potentially modulate Abeta production. Given that PI(4,5)P2 is produced by type 1 phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5Ks), we sought to determine whether the level of PIP5K type Ialpha (PIP5K1A) can affect production of Abeta by modulating the lipid composition of the membrane. Using a HEK-derived cell line that constitutively expresses yellow fluorescent protein-tagged APP (APP-YFP), we demonstrated that overexpression of PIP5K1A results in significant enhancement of non-amyloidogenic APP processing and a concomitant suppression of the amyloidogenic pathway, leading to a marked decrease in secreted Abeta. Consistently, cells overexpressing PIP5K1A exhibited a significant redistribution of APP-YFP from endosomal compartments to the cell surface. Our findings suggest that PIP5K1A may play a critical role in governing Abeta production by modulating membrane distribution of APP, and as such, the pathway may be a valuable therapeutic target for AD.",

Abeta peptides form diverse oligomers with various diameters before nucleation, making clarification of the mechanism involved a complex problem with conventional macroscopic analysis methods. Time-resolved single-molecule level analysis in bulk solution is thus required to fully understand their early stage aggregation behavior. Here, we perform time-resolved observation of the aggregation dynamics of Abeta oligomers in bulk solution using liquid-state transmission electron microscopy. Our observations reveal previously unknown behaviors. The most important discovery is that a salt crystal can precipitate even with a concentration much lower than its solubility, and it then dissolves in a short time, during which the aggregation reaction of Abeta peptides is significantly accelerated. These findings will provide new insights in the evolution of the Abeta oligomer.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) proteins have attracted considerable attention because of their involvement in protein misfolding diseases. These proteins have mostly been investigated using atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy to study the directional growth of fibrils both perpendicular to and along the fibril axis. Here, we demonstrate the real-time monitoring of the directional growth of fibrils in terms of activation energy of proton transfer using an impedance spectroscopy technique. The activation energy is used to quantify the sensitivity of proton conduction to the different stages of protein aggregation. The decrement (increment) in activation energy is related to the fibril growth along (perpendicular to) the fibril axis in intrinsic protein aggregation. The entire aggregation process shows different phases of the directional growth for Abeta and hIAPP, indicating different pathways for their aggregation. The activation energy for hIAPP is found to be smaller than the activation energy of Abeta during the aggregation process. The oscillatory behavior of the activation energy of hIAPP reflects a rapid change in the directional growth of the protofilaments of hIAPP. The results indicate higher aggregation propensity of Abeta than hIAPP. In the presence of resveratrol, hIAPP exhibits slower aggregation compared to Abeta. Methods of this study may in general be used to reveal the modulated aggregation pathway of proteins in the presence of different ligands.",

METHODS: A total of 396 older adults without dementia underwent comprehensive clinical assessments, measurement of serum albumin level, and multimodal brain imaging, including [11C] Pittsburgh compound B-PET, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, and MRI. Serum albumin was categorized as follows: <4.4 g/dL (low albumin), 4.4 to 4.5 g/dL (middle albumin), and >4.5 g/dL (high albumin; used as a reference category). Abeta positivity, AD-signature region cerebral glucose metabolism (AD-CM), AD-signature region cortical thickness (AD-CT), and WMH volume were used as outcome measures. RESULTS: Serum albumin level (as a continuous variable) was inversely associated with Abeta deposition and Abeta positivity. The low albumin group showed a significantly higher Abeta positivity rate compared to the high albumin group (odds ratio 3.40, 95% confidence interval 1.67-6.92, p = 0.001), while the middle albumin group showed no difference (odds ratio 1.74, 95% confidence interval 0.80-3.77, p = 0.162). Neither serum albumin level (as a continuous variable) nor albumin categories were related to AD-CM, AD-CT, or WMH volume. CONCLUSIONS: Low serum albumin may increase the risk of AD dementia by elevating amyloid accumulation. In terms of AD prevention, more attention needs to be paid to avoid a low serum albumin level, even within the clinical normal range, by clinicians.",

Rosmarinic acid is a well-known potent antioxidant molecule, the efficacy of which has been proved both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we investigated the possible role played by rosmarinic acid as a mediator of the copper(II)-induced neurotoxicity. Several spectroscopic techniques and biological assays were applied to characterize the metal complexes and to evaluate the cytotoxicity and the mutagenicity of rosmarinic acid and its Cu(II) complex.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore long-term predictors of avoiding beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition and maintaining unimpaired cognition as outcomes in the oldest old. METHODS: In a longitudinal observational cohort study, 100 former participants of the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study (GEMS; 2000-2008) completed biannual Pittsburgh compound B-PET imaging and annual clinical-cognitive evaluations beginning in 2010. Most recent Abeta status and cognitive status were selected for each participant. Longitudinal outcomes included change in serial Abeta and cognitive tests. Baseline predictors from GEMS included neuropsychological tests, daily functioning, APOE genotype, lifestyle variables, occupational measures, health history, sleep, subjective memory, physical and cognitive activities, depressive symptoms, and physical performance and health indices, among others. RESULTS: Mean age at the last cognitive evaluation was 92.0 (range 86-100) years. Mean follow-up time from baseline to last measured Abeta status was 12.3 (SD 1.9) years and to last cognitive evaluation was 14.1 (SD 1.9) years. The APOE*2 allele predicted last Abeta status (n = 34 Abeta negative vs n = 66 Abeta positive). Baseline cognition predicted cognitive status (n = 30 unimpaired vs n = 70 impaired). Predictors of cognitive status among Abeta-positive participants only (n = 14 normal cognition vs n = 52 impaired) were baseline cognitive test scores and smoking history. Baseline pulse pressure predicted longitudinal Abeta increase; paid work engagement and life satisfaction predicted less cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: The APOE*2 allele and lower pulse pressure predict resistance to Abeta deposition in advanced aging. Cognitive test scores 14 years prior, likely reflecting premorbid abilities, predict cognitive status and maintenance of unimpaired cognition in the presence of Abeta. Several lifestyle factors appear protective.",

AD pathology proceeds for decades before cognitive deficits become clinically apparent, opening a window for preventative therapy. Imbalance of clearance and buildup of amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau proteins in the central nervous system is believed to contribute to AD pathogenesis. However, multiple clinical trials of treatments aimed at averting accumulation of these proteins have yielded little success, and there is still no disease-modifying intervention. Here, we discuss current knowledge of AD pathology and treatment with an emphasis on emerging biomarkers and treatment strategies.",

We demonstrate early alterations in a gene co-expression network enriched for myelin and oligodendrocyte genes (OLIGs), whereas a multicellular gene co-expression network of plaque-induced genes (PIGs) involving the complement system, oxidative stress, lysosomes, and inflammation is prominent in the later phase of the disease.

    "abstract": "The molecular shield effect was studied for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that do not adopt compact and stable protein folds. IDPs are found among many stress-responsive gene products and cryoprotective- and drought-protective proteins. We recently reported that some fragments of human genome-derived IDPs are cryoprotective for cellular enzymes, despite a lack of relevant amino acid sequence motifs. This sequence-independent IDP function may reflect their molecular shield effect. This study examined the inhibitory activity of IDPs against fibril formation in an amyloid beta peptide (Abeta(1-42)) model system. Four of five human genome-derived IDPs (size range 20 to 44 amino acids) showed concentration-dependent inhibition of amyloid formation (IC50 range between 60 and 130 muM against 20 muM Abeta(1-42)). The IC50 value was two orders of magnitude lower than that of polyethylene-glycol and dextran, used as neutral hydrophilic polymer controls. Nuclear magnetic resonance with 15 N-labeled Abeta(1-42) revealed no relevant molecular interactions between Abeta(1-42) and IDPs. The inhibitory activities were abolished by adding external amyloid-formation seeds. Therefore, IDPs seemed to act only at the amyloid nucleation phase but not at the elongation phase. These results suggest that IDPs (0.1 mM or less) have a molecular shield effect that prevents aggregation of susceptible molecules.",

Based on this evidence, many current therapeutic approaches focus on the development of small molecules halting Abeta aggregation. However, due to the temporary and elusive structures of amyloid assemblies, the rational design of aggregation inhibitors remains a challenging task. Here we combine ThT assays and MD simulations to study Abeta aggregation in the presence of the natural compounds tyrosol (TY), 3-hydroxytyrosol (HDT), and 3-methoxytyrosol (homovanillyl alcohol - HVA). We show that albeit HDT is a potent inhibitor of amyloid growth, TY and HVA catalyze fibril formation. An inspection of MD simulations trajectories revealed that the different effects of these three molecules on Abeta1-40 aggregation are ascribable to their capacity to arrange H-bonds network between the ligand (position C-3) and the peptide (Glu22). We believe that our results may contribute to the design of more effective and safe small molecules able to contrast pathogenic amyloid aggregation.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the prevalence of amyloid neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) has significantly increased in developed countries due to increased life expectancy. This amyloid disease is characterized by the presence of accumulations and deposits of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in neuronal tissue, leading to the formation of oligomers, fibers, and plaques. First, oligomeric intermediates that arise during the aggregation process are currently thought to be primarily responsible for cytotoxicity in cells. This work aims to provide further insights into the mechanisms of cytotoxicity by studying the interaction of Abeta aggregates with Neuro-2a (N2a) neuronal cells and the effects caused by this interaction. For this purpose, we have exploited the advantages of advanced, multidimensional fluorescence microscopy techniques to determine whether different types of Abeta are involved in higher rates of cellular toxicity, and we measured the cellular stress caused by such aggregates by using a fluorogenic intracellular biothiol sensor. Stress provoked by the peptide is evident by N2a cells generating high levels of biothiols as a defense mechanism. In our study, we demonstrate that Abeta aggregates act as seeds for aggregate growth upon interacting with the cellular membrane, which results in cell permeability and damage and induces lysis. In parallel, these damaged cells undergo a significant increase in intracellular biothiol levels.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence implicates HSV type 1 (HSV1) in the pathogenesis of late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). HSV1 has evolved highly sophisticated strategies to evade host immunosurveillance. One strategy involves encoding a decoy Fcgamma receptor (FcgammaR), which blocks Fc-mediated effector functions, such as Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Ig gamma marker (GM) allotypes, encoded by highly polymorphic IGHG genes on chromosome 14q32, modulate this immunoevasion strategy, and thus may act as effect modifiers of the HSV1-AD association. In this nested case-control human study, 365 closely matched case-control pairs-whose blood was drawn on average 9.6 y before AD diagnosis-were typed for GM alleles by a TaqMan genotyping assay. APOE genotype and a genetic risk score based on nine additional previously known AD risk genes (ABCA7, BIN1, CD33, CLU, CR1, EPHA1, MS4A4E, NECTIN2, and PICALM) were extracted from a genome-wide association study analysis. Antiviral Abs were measured by ELISA. Conditional logistic regression models were applied. The distribution of GM 3/17 genotypes differed significantly between AD cases and controls, with higher frequency of GM 17/17 homozygotes in AD cases as compared with controls (19.8 versus 10.7%, p = 0.001). The GM 17/17 genotype was associated with a 4-fold increased risk of AD (odds ratio 4.142, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that Ig GM 17/17 genotype contributes to the risk of later AD development, independent of apolipoprotein epsilon4 genotype and other AD risk genes, and explain, at least in part, why every HSV1-infected person is not equally likely to develop HSV1-associated AD.",

Patients with CAD and cerebral ischemia are recommended to undergo antiplatelet therapy, but they have an increased incidence of major bleeding complications. Both assessment of the platelet activation status and response to antiplatelet therapy in each patient are highly desired. beta-Amyloid precursor protein (APP) 770 is expressed in vascular endothelial cells, and its extracellular region, a soluble form of APP770 (sAPP770, also called nexin-2), is proteolytically cleaved for shedding. Abundant sAPP770 is also released from activated platelets. In this study, we used peripheral blood samples from patients with CAD and control subjects and evaluated sAPP770 as a specific biomarker for platelet activation. First, the plasma levels of sAPP770 correlated well with those of the soluble form CD40 ligand (CD40L), an established biomarker for platelet activation. Additionally, flow cytometry analysis using peripheral blood cells showed that CD40L expression is up-regulated in activated T cells, whereas APP770 expression is negligible in all blood cell types except platelets. Following stimulation with collagen or ADP, aggregating platelets immediately released sAPP770. Finally, patients with dual antiplatelet therapy showed significantly lower levels of plasma sAPP770 than those with no therapy. Taken together, our data show that plasma sAPP770 could be a promising biomarker for platelet activation.",

    "abstract": "The neuropathological confirmation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) remains the gold standard for a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nowadays, the in vivo diagnosis of AD is greatly aided by both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers. Although highly accurate, their broad implementation is restricted by high cost, limited accessibility and invasiveness. We recently developed a high-performance, ultrasensitive immunoassay for the quantification of tau phosphorylated at threonine-181 (p-tau181) in plasma, which identifies AD pathophysiology with high accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether plasma p-tau181, measured years before the death, can predict the eventual neuropathological confirmation of AD, and successfully discriminates AD from non-AD dementia pathologies. We studied a unique cohort of 115 individuals with longitudinal blood collections with clinical evaluation at 8, 4 and 2 years prior to neuropathological assessment at death. The results demonstrate that plasma p-tau181 associates better with AD neuropathology and Braak staging than a clinical diagnosis 8 years before post-mortem. Moreover, while all patients had a diagnosis of AD dementia during life, plasma p-tau181 proved to discriminate AD from non-AD pathologies with high accuracy (AUC = 97.4%, 95% CI = 94.1-100%) even 8 years before death. Additionally, the longitudinal trajectory of plasma p-tau181 was assessed in all patients. We found that the main increases in plasma p-tau181 occurred between 8 and 4 years prior to death in patients with AD neuropathology and later plateauing. In contrast, non-AD pathologies and controls exhibited minor, albeit significant, increases in p-tau181 up until death. Overall, our study demonstrates that plasma p-tau181 is highly predictive and specific of AD neuropathology years before post-mortem examination. These data add further support for the use of plasma p-tau181 to aid clinical management in primary care and recruitment for clinical trials.",

    "title": "ORAI2 Down-Regulation Potentiates SOCE and Decreases Abeta42 Accumulation in Human Neuroglioma Cells.",
    "abstract": "Senile plaques, the hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), are generated by the deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta), the proteolytic product of amyloid precursor protein (APP), by beta and gamma-secretase. A large body of evidence points towards a role for Ca2+ imbalances in the pathophysiology of both sporadic and familial forms of AD (FAD). A reduction in store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is shared by numerous FAD-linked mutations, and SOCE is involved in Abeta accumulation in different model cells. In neurons, both the role and components of SOCE remain quite obscure, whereas in astrocytes, SOCE controls their Ca2+-based excitability and communication to neurons. Glial cells are also directly involved in Abeta production and clearance. Here, we focus on the role of ORAI2, a key SOCE component, in modulating SOCE in the human neuroglioma cell line H4. We show that ORAI2 overexpression reduces both SOCE level and stores Ca2+ content, while ORAI2 downregulation significantly increases SOCE amplitude without affecting store Ca2+ handling. In Abeta-secreting H4-APPswe cells, SOCE inhibition by BTP2 and SOCE augmentation by ORAI2 downregulation respectively increases and decreases Abeta42 accumulation. Based on these findings, we suggest ORAI2 downregulation as a potential tool to rescue defective SOCE in AD, while preventing plaque formation.",

In the current study, we determine by mass spectrometry the potential utility of plasma p-tau isoforms to detect AD pathology and investigate CSF and plasma tau isoforms' profile relationships. Plasma tau was truncated as previously described in CSF. CSF and plasma measures of p-tau-217 and p-tau-181 were correlated. No correlation was found between CSF and plasma on total-tau levels and pS202 measures. We found p-tau-217 and p-tau-181 were highly specific for amyloid plaque pathology in the discovery cohort (n = 36, AUROC = 0.99 and 0.98 respectively). In the validation cohort (n = 92), p-tau-217 measures were still specific to amyloid status (AUROC = 0.92), and p-tau-181 measures were less specific (AUROC = 0.75).",

    "title": "Reduction of advanced tau-mediated memory deficits by the MAP kinase p38gamma.",
    "abstract": "Hyperphosphorylation of the neuronal tau protein contributes to Alzheimer's disease (AD) by promoting tau pathology and neuronal and cognitive deficits. In contrast, we have previously shown that site-specific tau phosphorylation can inhibit toxic signals induced by amyloid-beta (Abeta) in mouse models. The post-synaptic mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase p38gamma mediates this site-specific phosphorylation on tau at Threonine-205 (T205). Using a gene therapeutic approach, we draw on this neuroprotective mechanism to improve memory in two Abeta-dependent mouse models of AD at stages when advanced memory deficits are present. Increasing activity of post-synaptic kinase p38gamma that targets T205 in tau reduced memory deficits in symptomatic Abeta-induced AD models. Reconstitution experiments with wildtype human tau or phosphorylation-deficient tauT205A showed that T205 modification is critical for downstream effects of p38gamma that prevent memory impairment in APP-transgenic mice. Furthermore, genome editing of the T205 codon in the murine Mapt gene showed that this single side chain in endogenous tau critically modulates memory deficits in APP-transgenic Alzheimer's mice. Ablating the protective effect of p38gamma activity by genetic p38gamma deletion in a tau transgenic mouse model that expresses non-pathogenic tau rendered tau toxic and resulted in impaired memory function in the absence of human Abeta. Thus, we propose that modulating neuronal p38gamma activity serves as an intrinsic tau-dependent therapeutic approach to augment compromised cognition in advanced dementia.",

    "title": "Beta-amyloid activates NLRP3 inflammasome via TLR4 in mouse microglia.",
    "abstract": "Beta-amyloid(Abeta)-induced inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nod-like receptor nucleotide-binding domain leucine rich repeat containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is involved in the Abeta-induced inflammation. However, the mechanisms by which extracellular Abeta activates cytoplasmic NLRP3 inflammasome are poorly understood. Toll-like receptor 4(TLR4) acts as a sensor of Abeta and performs a key role in neuroinflammation. TLR4 is involved in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome in several diseases. In this study, the interaction between TLR4 and NLRP3 inflammasome in Abeta1-42-induced neuroinflammation was investigated. BV-2 microglia and primary microglia were primed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and then pretreated with TLR4 inhibitor CLI-095, followed by stimulation with Abeta1-42. The protein expression of NLRP3, the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), and caspase-1 p 10 was detected by western blotting and immunostaining. The mRNA expression of inflammatory factors was measured by real-time PCR. The protein level of pro IL-1beta and IL-1beta was examined by ELISA. Activated microglia were examined by immunofluorescence staining for ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba-1). Conditioned medium of BV-2 cells was collected to challenge HT-22 neurons. Cell viability was assessed with MTT assay. Assessment of HT-22 cell apoptosis was performed by Annexin V/PI staining and western blotting to detect the protein level of cleaved caspase 3. The results showed that Abeta1-42 activated and up-regulated the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome in BV-2 microglia, as indicated by increased activation of caspase-1 and secretion of IL-1beta. Pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 by CLI-095 abolished Abeta1-42-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which curbed the development of inflammation and exerted protective effect on HT-22 neurons. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of CLI-095 on Abeta1-42-induced inflammation were reversed by NLRP3 activator ATP. Overall, our findings suggested TLR4 mediated Abeta1-42-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in mouse microglia. TLR4/NLRP3 pathway plays a critical role in Abeta1-42-induced neuroinflammation.",

    "title": "Tautomeric Effect of Histidine on beta-Sheet Formation of Amyloid Beta 1-40: 2D-IR Simulations.",
    "abstract": "Histidine state (protonated or delta or epsilon tautomer) has been considered the origin of abnormal misfolding and aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta). Our previous studies reported that the deltadeltadelta isomer of Abeta (1-40) has a greater propensity for beta-sheet conformation compared to other isomers. However, direct proof of the tautomeric effect has not been reported. In this context, we calculated histidine site-specific two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy of the deltadeltadelta, epsilonepsilonepsilon, and pipipi (all protonated histidine) systems within the framework of classical molecular dynamics simulations aiming at connecting our previous results with the current experimental observations. Our results showed that beta-sheet formation is favored for the deltadeltadelta and pipipi tautomers compared with the epsilonepsilonepsilon tautomer, consistent with our previous studies. This result was further supported by contact map analyses and the strength of dipole coupling between the amide-I bonds of each residue. The two-dimensional infrared diagonal trace for each tautomer included three distinctive spectrally resolvable peaks near 1680, 1686, and 1693 cm-1, as was also observed for histidine dipeptides. However, the peak positions at His6, His13, and His14 did not show a consensus trend with the histidine or protonation state but were instead affected by the presence of surrounding hydrogen bonds. Our study provides a deeper insight into the influence of tautomerism and protonation of histidine residues in Abeta (1-40) on amyloid misfolding and provides a connection between our previous simulations and experimental observations.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether vascular and neurodegenerative factors influence cognition before clinically relevant Alzheimer disease pathology, we analyzed MRI measures and amyloid imaging in an ethnoracially diverse cohort of cognitively normal individuals older than 60 years. METHODS: Participants (n = 154; mean age 74.15 +- 6.94; 50% female; 54% Caucasian, 22.1% Hispanic, 14.9% African American) were recruited from the University of California, Davis Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, who were cognitively normal at baseline, time of PET, and MRI, and received yearly cognitive assessment for 6.23 +- 4.16 years. Mixed model regression with random slope and intercept was calculated for episodic memory and executive function, adjusting for age, sex, education, and ethnicity. RESULTS: Vascular burden score was associated with total white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume (beta, 0.171; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.024-0.318). WMH volume was associated with low baseline executive function (-0.115; -0.226 to -0.003) and rate of change in memory (-0.029; -0.045 to -0.012). Hippocampal volume was associated with the rate of change in memory (0.040; 0.021-0.059) and executive function (0.024; 0.008-0.039). Continuous measures of amyloid status influenced change in memory (-0.026; -0.044 to -0.008) and executive function (-0.033; -0.046 to -0.021) independently of MRI measures. CONCLUSION: Vascular brain injury and neurodegeneration are associated with baseline cognitive performance and the rate of longitudinal change independent of amyloid status among community-dwelling, ethnicity diverse cognitively normal individuals, supporting the role of vascular diseases as risk factors for later-life dementia.",

    "title": "Beta-amyloid burden predicts poorer mnemonic discrimination in cognitively normal older adults.",
    "abstract": "One of the earliest indicators of Alzheimer's disease pathology is the presence of beta-amyloid (Alphabeta) protein deposition. Significant amyloid deposition is evident even in older adults who exhibit little or no overt cognitive or memory impairment. Hippocampal-based processes that help distinguish between highly similar memory representations may be the most susceptible to early disease pathology. Amyloid associations with memory have been difficult to establish, possibly because typical memory assessments do not tax hippocampal operations sufficiently. Thus, the present study utilized a spatial mnemonic discrimination task designed to tax hippocampal pattern separation/completion processes in a sample of cognitively normal middle-aged and older adults (53-98 years old) who underwent PET 18F-Florbetapir Alphabeta scanning. The degree of interference between studied and new information varied, allowing for an examination of mnemonic discrimination as a function of mnemonic similarity. Results indicated that greater beta-amyloid burden was associated with poorer discrimination across decreasing levels of interference, suggesting that even subtle elevation of beta-amyloid in cognitively normal adults is associated with impoverished performance on a hippocampally demanding memory task. The present study demonstrates that degree of amyloid burden negatively impacts the ability of aging adults to accurately distinguish old from increasingly distinct new information, providing novel insight into the cognitive expression of beta-amyloid neuropathology.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is defined by irreversible cell-cycle arrest and is an evolutionarily conserved hallmark of aging. In this study, we generate senescent microglial cells via exposure to the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin. Compared to control cells, doxorubicin-treated microglia exhibited an altered morphology characterized by an enlarged cell size, a flattened appearance, and the development of prominent filaments. Senescent cells harbored elevated levels of senescence associated-beta-galactosidase, p16Ink4a, and gamma-H2AX. Senescent microglia were also less efficient at internalizing amyloid beta and pHrodo bioparticles. A detailed proteomic analysis using SWATH-MS identified 201 proteins that were significantly downregulated and 127 that were significantly upregulated in doxorubicin-treated microglia. Proteins involved in processes such as protein synthesis, RNA damage and repair, and protein degradation were largely downregulated while those compromising the integrity of the cell were predominantly upregulated. Various proteins involved in proteasomal processing were among the most significantly downregulated in senescent cells. Relevant to the deleterious senescence-associated secretory phenotype, senescent cells secreted higher levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and GRO-alpha. Our data suggest that symptoms of brain aging and age-related neurodegenerative disease may be partially caused by defective phagocytosis, impaired proteasomal processing, and elevated cytokine secretion of senescent microglia.",

    "abstract": "Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), a natural product derived from Radix Astragali (Astragalus membranaceus), is beneficial for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanisms underlying this benefit are not completely understood. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are potential therapeutic targets for AD. In this study, we found that amyloid beta protein fragment 1-42 oligomers (AbetaO) suppressed BDNF and PPARgamma expression, and inhibited tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) phosphorylation in cultured hippocampal neurons; these changes were ameliorated by treatment with AS-IV. Inhibition of PPARgamma by genetic and pharmacological methods also blocked the effect of AS-IV on BDNF expression in AbetaO-treated cells. Importantly, exogenous BDNF protected against neurotoxicity and apoptosis induced by AbetaO, whereas inhibition of PPARgamma reversed protective effects of AS-IV against these outcomes. In vivo data further revealed that AS-IV improved AbetaO-induced memory impairment and reduced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. Moreover, AS-IV suppressed the AbetaO-induced reduction in BDNF by promoting PPARgamma activation in the hippocampus. Taken together, these results indicate that AS-IV prevents AbetaO-induced memory impairment and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, probably by promoting the PPARgamma/BDNF signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Beta amyloid (Abeta) is a key component of parenchymal Abeta plaques and vascular Abeta fibrils, which lead to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have revealed that Abeta contained in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can re-enter into brain through paravascular spaces. However, whether Abeta in CSF may act as a constant source of pathogenic Abeta in AD is still unclear. This study aimed to examine whether Abeta pathology could be worsened when CSF Abeta level was enhanced by intra-cisternal infusion of aged brain extract containing abundant Abeta in TgCRND8 host mice. TgCRND8 mouse is an AD animal model which develops predominant parenchymal Abeta plaques in the brain at as early as 3 months of age. Here, we showed that single intracisternal injection of Abeta seeds into TgCRND8 mice before the presence of Abeta pathology induced robust prion-like propagation of CAA within 90 days. The induced CAA is mainly distributed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and thalamus of TgCRND8 mice. Surprisingly, despite the robust increase in CAA levels, the TgCRND8 mice had a marked decrease in parenchymal Abeta plaques and the plaques related neuroinflammation in the brains compared with the control mice. These results amply indicate that Abeta in CSF may act as a source of Abeta contributing to the growth of vascular Abeta deposits in CAA. Our findings provide experimental evidence to unravel the mechanisms of CAA formation and the potential of targeting CSF Abeta for CAA.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs have been proven to play an important role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the function of small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (SNHG1) in AD progression remains to be studied. OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of SNHG1 in AD progression and clarify its potential mechanism. METHODS: Amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) was used to construct an AD cell model in vitro. The expression levels of SNHG1 and miR-361-3p were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured by cell counting kit 8 assay and flow cytometry. The levels of apoptosis-related proteins and zinc finger gene 217 (ZNF217) protein were evaluated by western blot analysis. Additionally, the contents of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays were used to verify the interaction between miR-361-3p and SNHG1 or ZNF217. RESULTS: Abeta could induce cell injury, while resveratrol could reverse this effect. SNHG1 expression was positively regulated by Abeta and negatively regulated by resveratrol. SNHG1 knockdown could reverse the promotion effect of Abeta on cell injury. Moreover, SNHG1 sponged miR-361-3p, and miR-361-3p targeted ZNF217. Additionally, miR-361-3p overexpression reversed the promotion effect of SNHG1 overexpression on cell injury, and ZNF217 silencing also reversed the promotion effect of miR-361-3p inhibitor on cell injury. CONCLUSION: SNHG1 promoted cell injury by regulating the miR-361-3p/ZNF217 axis, which might provide a theoretical basis for molecular therapy of AD.",

    "title": "Dioscin Protects against Abeta1-42 Oligomers-Induced Neurotoxicity via the Function of SIRT3 and Autophagy.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with high incidence among old people. Dioscin is a product extracted from natural herbs, which has multiple pharmacological activities. In this study, we investigated the potential effects of disocin on amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta1-42) oligomers-treated HT22 cells. Abeta1-42 oligomers induced great neurotoxicity to HT22 cells as examined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The results of terminal deoxynucleoitidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate biotin nich end labeling (TUNEL) staining and flow cytometry indicated that Abeta1-42 oligomers led to increased apoptosis and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HT22 cells. However, dioscin could remarkably inhibit the neurotoxicity induced by Abeta1-42 oligomers, as well as decrease the apoptosis and ROS generation. Sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) staining and quantification indicated that dioscin upregulated the expression of neuroprotective SIRT3. Moreover, dioscin induced the formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes in HT22 cells. Dioscin also enhanced the levels of Beclin-1 and LC3-II while decreased the level of p62. These results suggested that dioscin could activate autophagy in HT22 cells. It was also found that knocking down SIRT3 resulted in the downregulation of Beclin-1, LC3-II and the aggregation of p62, suggesting that SIRT3 was an important regulator in autophagy. Furthermore, we found that knocking down SIRT3 or inhibiting autophagy suppressed the protective effects of dioscin on Abeta1-42 oligomers-induced neurotoxicity, apoptosis and ROS generation. These results revealed that SIRT3 and autophagy functioned together in the neuroprotective mechanisms of dioscin. Therefore, dioscin might be a promising drug to protect against Abeta1-42 oligomers-induced neurotoxicity and reduce neuron damage or death in AD.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a novel approach of detecting different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and imaging beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain using RF sensors. Dielectric measurements were obtained from grey matter and white matter regions of brain tissues with severe AD pathology at a frequency range of 200 MHz to 3 GHz using a vector network analyzer and dielectric probe. Computational models were created on CST Microwave Suite using a realistic head model and the measured dielectric properties to represent affected brain regions at different stages of AD. Simulations were carried out to test the performance of the RF sensors. Experiments were performed using textile-based RF sensors on fabricated phantoms, representing a human brain with different volumes of AD-affected brain tissues. Experimental data was collected from the sensors and processed in an imaging algorithm to reconstruct images of the affected areas in the brain. Measured dielectric properties in brain tissues with AD pathology were found to be different from healthy human brain tissues. Simulation and experimental results indicated a correlated shift in the captured reflection coefficient data from RF sensors as the amount of affected brain regions increased. Finally, images reconstructed from the imaging algorithm successfully highlighted areas of the brain affected by plaques and tangles as a result of AD. The results from this study show that RF sensing can be used to identify areas of the brain affected by AD pathology. This provides a promising new non-invasive technique for monitoring the progression of AD.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we compared the effects of two well-known natural compounds on the early step of the fibrillation process of amyloid-beta (1-40), responsible for the formation of plaques in the brains of patients affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD). The use of extensive replica exchange simulations up to the micros scale allowed us to characterize the inhibition activity of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and curcumin (CUR) on unfolded amyloid fibrils. A reduced number of beta-strands, characteristic of amyloid fibrils, and an increased distance between the amino acids that are responsible for the intra- and interprotein aggregations are observed. The central core region of the amyloid-beta (Abeta(1-40)) fibril is found to have a high affinity to EGCG and CUR due to the presence of hydrophobic residues. Lastly, the free binding energy computed using the Poisson Boltzmann Surface Ares suggests that EGCG is more likely to bind to unfolded Abeta(1-40) fibrils and that this molecule can be a good candidate to develop new and more effective congeners to treat AD.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation process of the Amyloidbeta (Abeta) peptide is one of the central questions in Alzheimers's research. Fluorescence-labeled single-molecule detection is a novel technique concerning the early stage investigation of Abeta aggregation, where the labeling dyes are covalently bound to the Abeta monomer. As the influence of the dye on the conformational space of the Abeta monomer can be significant, its effect on the seeding process is an open question. The applied fluorescent molecule continuously switches between an active (ON) and an inactive (OFF) state, where the latter supports an extra rotational restriction at many commercially available dyes. However, only a few theoretical studies simulated the Abeta monomer in the presence of a dye and none of them considered the difference between the ON and the OFF states. Therefore, we examined the impact of a selected fluorescence dye (Alexa 568) on the conformational space of the monomeric Abeta(1-42) peptide in its ON and OFF state by replica exchange molecular dynamic simulations. Investigations on secondary structure elements as well as dye-peptide contact analysis for the monomers are presented. Experimental and theoretical NMR shifts were contrasted to qualify the calculation protocol and theoretical values of the labeled and the non-labeled peptide were also compared. We found that the first five residues have higher helical propensity in the presence of the dye, and electrostatic properties could strongly affect the connection between the dye and the peptide parts.",

They are intended to be used to calibrate diagnostic assays for Abeta42 . METHODS: The three certified reference materials (CRMs), ERM-DA480/IFCC, ERM-DA481/IFCC and ERM-DA482/IFCC, were prepared at three concentration levels and characterized using isotope dilution mass spectrometry methods. Roche, EUROIMMUN, and Fujirebio used the three CRMs to re-calibrate their immunoassays. RESULTS: The certified Abeta42 mass concentrations in ERM-DA480/IFCC, ERM-DA481/IFCC, and ERM-DA482/IFCC are 0.45, 0.72, and 1.22 mug/L, respectively, with expanded uncertainties (k = 2) of 0.07, 0.11, and 0.18 mug/L, respectively. Before re-calibration, a good correlation (Pearson's r > 0.97), yet large biases, were observed between results from different commercial assays. After re-calibration the between-assay bias was reduced to < 5%. DISCUSSION: The Abeta42 CRMs can ensure the equivalence of results between methods and across platforms for the measurement of Abeta42 .",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. In this study, to investigate the effect of microglial elimination on AD progression, we administered PLX3397, a selective colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor, to the mouse model of AD (5xFAD mice). Amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and amyloid precursor protein (APP), carboxyl-terminal fragment beta, ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1, synaptophysin, and postsynaptic density (PSD)-95 levels were evaluated in the cortex and hippocampus. In addition, the receptor density changes in dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 were evaluated using positron emission tomography (PET). D2R, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and dopamine transporter (DAT) levels were analyzed in the brains of Tg (5xFAD) mice using immunohistochemistry. PLX3397 administration significantly decreased Abeta deposition following microglial depletion in the cortex and hippocampus of Tg mice. In the neuro-PET studies, the binding values for D2R in the Tg mice were lower than those in the wild type mice; however, after PLX3397 treatment, the binding dramatically increased. PLX3397 administration also reversed the changes in synaptophysin and PSD-95 expression in the brain. Furthermore, the D2R and TH expression in the brains of Tg mice was significantly lower than that in the wild type; however, after PLX3397 administration, the D2R and TH levels were significantly higher than those in untreated Tg mice. Thus, our findings show that administering PLX3397 to aged 5xFAD mice could prevent amyloid pathology, concomitant with the rescue of dopaminergic signaling, suggesting that targeting microglia may serve as a useful therapeutic option for neurodegenerative diseases, including AD.",

Although many of the biological aspects that contribute to the formation of Abeta plaques are well addressed at the intra- and intercellular levels in short timescales, an understanding of how Abeta fibrillization usually starts to dominate at a longer timescale despite the presence of mechanisms dedicated to Abeta clearance is still lacking. Furthermore, no existing mathematical model integrates the impact of diurnal neural activity as emanated from circadian regulation to predict disease progression due to a disruption in the sleep-wake cycle. In this study, we develop a minimal model of Abeta fibrillization to investigate the onset of AD over a long timescale. Our results suggest that the diseased state is a manifestation of a phase change of the system from soluble Abeta (sAbeta) to fibrillar Abeta (fAbeta) domination upon surpassing a threshold in the production rate of sAbeta. By incorporating the circadian rhythm into our model, we reveal that fAbeta accumulation is crucially dependent on the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle, thereby indicating the importance of good sleep hygiene in averting AD onset. We also discuss potential intervention schemes to reduce fAbeta accumulation in the brain by modification of the critical sAbeta production rate.",

    "abstract": "MRZ-99030 (GAL-101) is a small molecule that promotes the formation of off-pathway, non-toxic amorphous clusters of Abeta thereby reducing the amount of toxic soluble oligomeric Abeta species. MRZ-99030 clearly prevents synaptotoxic effects of Abeta1-42 oligomers on synaptic plasticity and cognition. Long lasting in vivo effects indicate that MRZ-99030 seeds a beneficial self-replication of non-toxic Abeta aggregates - \"trigger effect\". To test this, we prepared a serial dilution of MRZ-99030 starting with a 20:1 stoichiometric excess to Abeta1-42. After incubating the Abeta1-42/MRZ-99030 mixture for 20 min, 10% was transferred to a freshly prepared Abeta1-42 solution. This dilution step was repeated 3 times finally resulting in a 500:1 stoichiometric excess of Abeta1-42 over MRZ-99030. This solution was tested for its ability to impair long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 neurons. Even following serial dilution, MRZ-99030 prevented the synaptotoxic effect of Abeta1-42 on CA1-LTP after tetanic stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals whereas incubation with MRZ-99030 (0.1 nM) without serial dilution did not prevent the synaptic deficits caused by Abeta1-42 (50 nM). Time course experiments revealed that this protective effect was still evident even when the serially diluted Abeta1-42/MRZ-99030 mixture was prepared up to 1 week before the LTP experiment. MRZ-99030, when serially diluted with Abeta1-42, was also capable of detoxifying/reversing an already established neurotoxic process. In TEM experiments, Abeta oligomers/annular protofibrils were converted to amorphous Abeta clusters following incubation with serially diluted MRZ-99030 to a final concentration of MRZ-99030 (20 nM) and Abeta1-42 (10 muM).",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether years of education and the epsilon4 risk allele at APOE influence beta-amyloid (Abeta) pathology similarly in asymptomatic individuals with a family history of sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) and presymptomatic autosomal dominant AD mutation carriers. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from 106 asymptomatic individuals with a parental history of sporadic AD (PREVENT-AD cohort; age 67.28 +- 4.72 years) and 117 presymptomatic autosomal dominant AD mutation carriers (DIAN cohort; age 35.04 +- 9.43 years). All participants underwent structural MRI and Abeta-PET imaging. In each cohort we investigated the influence of years of education, APOE epsilon4 status, and their interaction on Abeta-PET. RESULTS: Asymptomatic individuals with a parental history of sporadic AD showed increased Abeta burden associated with APOE epsilon4 carriage and lower level of education, but no interaction between these. Presymptomatic mutation carriers of autosomal dominant AD showed no relation between APOE epsilon4 and Abeta burden, but increasing level of education was associated with reduced Abeta burden. The association between educational attainment and Abeta burden was similar in the 2 cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: While the APOE epsilon4 allele confers increased tendency toward Abeta accumulation in sporadic AD only, protective environmental factors, like increased education, may promote brain resistance against Abeta pathology in both sporadic and autosomal dominant AD.",

    "abstract": "Senescence-accelerated mouse prone 10 (SAMP10) exhibits cerebral atrophy and depression-like behavior. A line of SAMP10 with spontaneous mutation in the Slc5a2 gene encoding the sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 was named SAMP10/TaSlc-Slc5a2slc (SAMP10-DeltaSglt2) and was identified as a renal diabetes model. In contrast, a line of SAMP10 with no mutation in SGLT2 (SAMP10/TaIdrSlc, SAMP10(+)) was recently established under a specific pathogen-free condition. Here, we examined the mutation effect in SGLT2 on brain function and longevity. No differences were found in the survival curve, depression-like behavior, and age-related brain atrophy between SAMP10-DeltaSglt2 and SAMP10(+). However, memory retention was lower in SAMP10-DeltaSglt2 mice than SAMP10(+). Amyloid beta (A4) precursor-like protein 1 (Aplp1) expression was significantly lower in the hippocampus of SAMP10-DeltaSGLT2 than in SAMP10(+) at 2 months of age, but was similar at 12 months of age. CaM kinase-like vesicle association (Camkv) expression was remarkably lower in SAMP10(+). These genes have been reported to be involved in dendrite function. Amyloid precursor proteins have been reported to involve in maintaining homeostasis of glucose and insulin. These results suggest that mutation in SGLT2 results in down-regulation of Aplp1 in young age, which can lead to poor memory retention in old age.",

This knowledge has prompted us to design and optimize a rapid and simple high-throughput assay that relies on the ability of test compounds to form ternary soluble complexes TTR/Abeta/SMC that prevent Abeta aggregation. The method uses the shorter Abeta(12-28) sequence which is cheaper and simpler to use while retaining the aggregation properties of their parents Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42). The test is carried out in 96-plate wells that are UV monitored for turbidity during 6 h.

These probabilistic causal models enabled detection, prioritization and replication of high-confidence master regulators of AD-associated networks, including the top predicted regulator, VGF. Overexpression of neuropeptide precursor VGF in 5xFAD mice partially rescued beta-amyloid-mediated memory impairment and neuropathology.

A major finding is the experimental detection of high molecular weight oligomers (HMWO) that converts into fibrils nuclei. Our observations are consistent with a mechanism of Abeta1-40 fibrillogenesis that includes the following key steps: i) slow formation of HMWO (Rh ~ 20 nm); ii) conversion of the HMWO into more compact Rh ~ 10 nm fibrils nuclei; iii) fast formation of additional fibrils nuclei through fibril surface catalysed processes; and iv) growth of fibrils by addition of soluble Abeta species.

    "abstract": "Specificity and sensitivity of positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceuticals targeting fibrillar amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits is high for detection of neuritic Abeta plaques, a mature form of Abeta deposits which often have dense Abeta core (i.e., cored plaques). However, imaging-to-autopsy validation studies of amyloid PET radioligands have identified several false positive cases all of which had mainly diffuse Abeta plaques (i.e., plaques without neuritic pathology or dense amyloid core), and high amyloid PET signal was reported in the striatum where diffuse plaques predominate in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Relative contributions of different plaque types to amyloid PET signal is unclear, particularly in neocortical areas where they are intermixed in AD. In vitro binding assay and autoradiography were performed using [3H]flutemetamol and [3H]Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) in frozen brain homogenates from 30 autopsy cases including sporadic AD and non-AD controls with a range of brain Abeta burden and plaque density. Fixed tissue sections of frontal cortex and caudate from 10 of the AD cases were processed for microscopy using fluorescent derivatives of flutemetamol (cyano-flutemetamol) and PiB (cyano-PiB) and compared to Abeta immunohistochemistry and pan-amyloid (X-34) histology. Using epifluorescence microscopy, percent area coverage and fluorescence output values of cyano-PiB- and cyano-flutemetamol-labeled plaques in two-dimensional microscopic fields were then calculated and combined to obtain integrated density measurements. Using confocal microscopy, we analysed total fluorescence output of the entire three-dimensional volume of individual cored plaques and diffuse plaques labeled with cyano-flutemetamol or cyano-PiB. [3H]Flutemetamol and [3H]PiB binding values in tissue homogenates correlated strongly and their binding pattern in tissue sections, as seen on autoradiograms, overlapped the pattern of Abeta-immunoreactive plaques on directly adjacent sections. Cyano-flutemetamol and cyano-PiB fluorescence was prominent in cored plaques and less so in diffuse plaques. Across brain regions and cases, percent area coverage of cyano-flutemetamol-labeled plaques correlated strongly with cyano-PiB-labeled and Abeta-immunoreactive plaques. For both ligands, plaque burden, calculated as percent area coverage of all Abeta plaque types, was similar in frontal cortex and caudate regions, while integrated density values were significantly greater in frontal cortex, which contained both cored plaques and diffuse plaques, compared to the caudate, which contained only diffuse plaques. Three-dimensional analysis of individual plaques labeled with either ligand showed that total fluorescence output of a single cored plaque was equivalent to total fluorescence output of approximately three diffuse plaques of similar volume. Our results indicate that [18F]flutemetamol and [11C]PiB PET signal is influenced by both diffuse plaques and cored plaques, and therefore is likely a function of plaque size and density of Abeta fibrils in plaques. Brain areas with large volumes/frequencies of diffuse plaques could yield [18F]flutemetamol and [11C]PiB PET retention levels comparable to brain regions with a lower volume/frequency of cored plaques.",

Our previous studies have suggested a beneficial role for EVs in AD, where the endosomal system in vulnerable neurons is compromised, contributing to the removal of accumulated material from neurons. However, the involvement of EVs in propagating AD amyloidosis throughout the brain has been considered because the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), APP metabolites, and key APP cleaving enzymes were identified in association with EVs. Here, we undertook to determine whether the secretase machinery is actively processing APP in EVs isolated from the brains of wild-type and APP overexpressing Tg2576 mice. We found that full-length APP is cleaved in EVs incubated in the absence of cells. The resulting metabolites, both alpha- and beta-APP carboxyl-terminal fragments and APP intracellular domain accumulate in EVs over time and amyloid-beta dimerizes. Thus, EVs contribute to the removal from neurons and transport of APP-derived neurotoxic peptides. While this is potentially a venue for propagation of the pathology throughout the brain, it may contribute to efficient removal of neurotoxic peptides from the brain.",

Identifying biomarkers of AD progression in DS can provide valuable insights into pathogenesis and suggest targets for disease modifying treatments. Methods: We describe the development of a multi-center, longitudinal study of biomarkers of AD in DS. The protocol includes longitudinal examination of clinical, cognitive, blood and cerebrospinal fluid-based biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography measures (at 16-month intervals), as well as genetic modifiers of AD risk and progression. Results: Approximately 400 individuals will be enrolled in the study (more than 370 to date). The methodological approach from the administrative, clinical, neuroimaging, omics, neuropathology, and statistical cores is provided.

    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), insoluble Abeta42 peptide fragments self-aggregate and form oligomers and fibrils in the brain, causing neurotoxicity. Further, the presence of redox-active metal ions such as Cu2+ enhances the aggregation process through chelation with these Abeta42 aggregates as well as generation of Abeta42-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein, we have adopted a bioinspired strategy to design and develop a multifunctional glycopeptide hybrid molecule (Glupep), which can serve as a potential AD therapeutic. This molecule consists of a natural metal-chelating tetrapeptide motif of human serum albumin (HSA), a beta-sheet breaker peptide, and a sugar moiety for better bioavailability. We performed different biophysical and docking experiments, which revealed that Glupep not only associates with Abeta42 but also prevents its self-aggregation to form toxic oligomers and fibrils. Moreover, Glupep was also shown to sequester out Cu2+ from the Abeta-Cu2+ complex, reducing the ROS formation and toxicity. Besides, this study also revealed that Glupep could protect PC12-derived neurons from Abeta-Cu2+-mediated toxicity by reducing intracellular ROS generation and stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential. All these exciting features show Glupep to be a potent inhibitor of Abeta42-mediated multifaceted toxicity and a prospective therapeutic lead for AD.",

    "title": "Rhodamine-Based Metal Chelator: A Potent Inhibitor of Metal-Catalyzed Amyloid Toxicity.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits a multitude of syndromes which add up to its complex nature. In AD, amyloid plaques are deposited along with abnormal accumulation of transition-metal ions. These transition-metal ions are redox-active and help to induce the formation of various polymorphic forms of amyloid-beta. Amyloid oligomeric and fibrillar aggregates are the main cause for neuronal toxicity. Another reason for neuronal toxicity arises from generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) catalyzed by redox-active metal ions through Fenton's reaction. In this direction, an Abeta inhibitor possessing the metal chelation property will be the most promising approach against multifaceted AD. Herein, a rhodamine-B-based compound (Rh-BT) has been designed and synthesized. Rhodamine was attached with benzothiazole as a recognition unit for amyloid-beta aggregates. The molecule can effectively capture redox metal ions from the Abeta-Cu2+ complex as well as inhibit Abeta self-assembly such as toxic oligomeric and fibrillar aggregates. Various biophysical assays show that Rh-BT interacts with the Abeta peptide, is capable of decreasing metal-induced ROS generation, and inhibits Abeta-Cu2+-induced cytotoxicity. All these results support the multifunctional nature of Rh-BT, which has an Abeta-specific recognition unit. In addition to the above properties, Rh-BT also exhibits good serum stability in vivo and blood-brain barrier permeability. Therefore, Rh-BT can be considered as a potent multifunctional therapeutic for the treatment of AD.",

Strong genetic and histological evidence links these conditions to the process of protein aggregation, yet it has remained challenging to identify a definitive connection between aggregation and pathogenicity. Using time-resolved fluorescence microscopy of individual synthetic vesicles, we show for the Abeta42 peptide implicated in Alzheimer's disease that the disruption of lipid bilayers correlates linearly with the time course of the levels of transient oligomers generated through secondary nucleation. These findings indicate a specific role of oligomers generated through the catalytic action of fibrillar species during the protein aggregation process in driving deleterious biological function and establish a direct causative connection between amyloid formation and its pathological effects.",

    "abstract": "Neurotrophins promote neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity via activating the tropomyosin receptor kinases. BDNF and its high-affinity receptor TrkB are reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD), contributing to progressive cognitive decline. However, how the signaling mediates AD pathologies remains incompletely understood. Here we show that the TrkB receptor binds and phosphorylates APP, reducing amyloid-beta production, which are abrogated by delta-secretase cleavage of TrkB in AD. Remarkably, BDNF stimulates TrkB to phosphorylate APP Y687 residue that accumulates APP in the TGN (Trans-Golgi Network) and diminishes its amyloidogenic cleavage. Delta-secretase cleaves TrkB at N365 and N486/489 residues and abolishes its neurotrophic activity, decreasing p-APP Y687 and altering its subcellular trafficking. Notably, both TrkB and APP are robustly cleaved by delta-secretase in AD brains, accompanied by mitigated TrkB signaling and reduced p-Y687. Blockade of TrkB cleavage attenuates AD pathologies in 5xFAD mice, rescuing the learning and memory. Viral expression of TrkB 1-486 fragment in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice facilitates amyloid pathology and mitigates cognitive functions. Hence, delta-secretase cleaves TrkB and blunts its phosphorylation of APP, facilitating AD pathogenesis.",

In vitro studies identified the most inhibitory compounds against self-induced Abeta1-42 aggregation as 18c, 18d and 18f (EC50 = 1.72, 1.48 and 1.08 microM, respectively) compared to the known anti-amyloid drug, clioquinol (1, EC50 = 9.95 microM). The fluorescence of thioflavin T-stained amyloid formed by Abeta1-42 aggregation in the presence of Cu2+ or Zn2+ ions was also dramatically decreased by treatment with 18c, 18d and 18f. The most potent hybrid compound 18f afforded 82.3% and 88.3% inhibition, respectively, against Cu2+- induced and Zn2+- induced Abeta1-42 aggregation.

    "abstract": "The deposition of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and fibrils in the brain parenchyma is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but a mechanistic understanding of the role Abeta plays in AD has remained unclear. One important reason could be the limitations of current tools to size and count Abeta fibrils in real time. Conventional techniques from molecular biology largely use ensemble averaging; some microscopy analyses have been reported but suffer from low throughput. Nanoparticle tracking analysis is an alternative approach developed in the past decade for sizing and counting particles according to their Brownian motion; however, it is limited in sensitivity to polydisperse solutions because it uses only one laser. More recently, multispectral nanoparticle tracking analysis (MNTA) was introduced to address this limitation; it uses three visible wavelengths to quantitate heterogeneous particle distributions. Here, we used MNTA as a label-free technique to characterize the in vitro kinetics of Abeta1-42 aggregation by measuring the size distributions of aggregates during self-assembly. Our results show that this technology can monitor the aggregation of 106-108 particles/mL with a temporal resolution between 15 and 30 min. We corroborated this method with the fluorescent Thioflavin-T assay and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), showing good agreement between the techniques (Pearson's r = 0.821, P < 0.0001). We also used fluorescent gating to examine the effect of ThT on the aggregate size distribution. Finally, the biological relevance was demonstrated via fibril modulation in the presence of a polyphenolic Abeta disruptor. In summary, this approach measures Abeta assembly similar to ensemble-type measurements but with per-fibril resolution.",

We, therefore, aimed to develop a cognitive composite score that can detect the subtle cognitive differences between the amyloid positive (Abeta+) and negative (Abeta-) status in cognitively normal (CN) participants. A total of 423 CN participants with Abeta positron emission tomography images were recruited. The multiple-indicators multiple-causes model found the latent mean difference between the Abeta+ and Abeta- groups in the domains of verbal memory, visual memory, and executive functions. The multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) showed that the Abeta+ group performed worse in tests related to the verbal and visual delayed recall, semantic verbal fluency, and inhibition of cognitive inference within the three cognitive domains. The Preclinical Amyloid Sensitive Composite (PASC) model we developed using the result of MANCOVA and the MMSE presented a good fit with the data. The accuracy of the PASC score when applied with age, sex, education, and APOE epsilon4 for distinguishing between Abeta+ and Abeta- was adequate (AUC = 0.764; 95% CI = 0.667-0.860) in the external validation set (N = 179).

    "abstract": "Currently, over 44 million people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD). A common feature of AD is disrupted sleep. Sleep is essential for many psychological and physiological functions, though 35.3% of adults report getting less than 7 hours per night. The present research examined whether chronic sleep restriction would elevate hippocampal amyloid-beta1-42 expression or alter cognitive ability in adult C57BL/6 mice. Chronic sleep restriction was associated with cognitive impairment and increased hippocampal amyloid-beta. Thus, chronic sleep loss may have a detrimental effect upon cognitive function, in part, via increasing amyloid-beta levels in the hippocampus, even in non-genetically modified mice.",

We investigated the effect of APOE genotype on CMBs in a cohort of cognitively unimpaired middle- and old-aged individuals enriched for APOE-epsilon4 genotype. Participants from ALFA (Alzheimer and Families) cohort were included and their magnetic resonance scans assessed (n = 564, 50% APOE-epsilon4 carriers). Quantitative magnetic resonance analyses included visual ratings, atrophy measures, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) segmentations. The prevalence of CMBs was 17%, increased with age (p < 0.05), and followed an increasing trend paralleling APOE-epsilon4 dose. The number of CMBs was significantly higher in APOE-epsilon4 homozygotes compared to heterozygotes and non-carriers (p < 0.05). This association was driven by lobar CMBs (p < 0.05). CMBs co-localized with WMH (p < 0.05). No associations between CMBs and APOE-epsilon2, gray matter volumes, and cognitive performance were found. Our results suggest that cerebral vessels of APOE-epsilon4 homozygous are more fragile, especially in lobar locations. Co-occurrence of CMBs and WMH suggests that such changes localize in areas with increased vascular vulnerability.",

Herein, we report the design and validation of chemiluminescence probe ADLumin-1 as a turn-on probe for amyloid beta (Abeta) species. Two-photon imaging indicates that ADLumin-1 can efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier and provides excellent contrast for Abeta plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. In vivo brain imaging shows that the chemiluminescence signal of ADLumin-1 from 5-month-old transgenic 5xFAD mice is 1.80-fold higher than that from the age-matched wild-type mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is feasible to further dually-amplify signal via chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (DAS-CRET) using two non-conjugated smart probes (ADLumin-1 and CRANAD-3) in solutions, brain homogenates, and in vivo whole brain imaging. Our results show that DAS-CRET can provide a 2.25-fold margin between 5-month-old 5xFAD mice and wild type mice. We believe that our strategy could be extended to other aggregating-prone proteins.",

An important mechanism of Abeta clearance in the brain is uptake and degradation by microglia. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase, an enzyme complex responsible for the maturation of multiple substrates, such as Abeta. Although PS1 has been extensively studied in neurons, the role of PS1 in microglia is incompletely understood. Here we report that microglia containing phospho-deficient mutant PS1 display a slower kinetic response to micro injury in the brain in vivo and the inability to degrade Abeta oligomers due to a phagolysosome dysfunction. An Alzheimer's mouse model containing phospho-deficient PS1 show severe Abeta accumulation in microglia as well as the postsynaptic protein PSD95. Our results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which PS1 modulates microglial function and contributes to Alzheimer's -associated phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) has an insidious onset and heterogeneous clinical symptoms. The well-accepted biomarkers for clinical diagnosis of AD include beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition and pathologic tau level within cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and imaging AD pathology such as positive emission tomography (PET) imaging of the amyloid-binding agent Pittsburgh compound B (PET-PiB). However, the high expense and invasive nature of these methods highly limit their wide usage in clinic practice. Therefore, it is imperious to develop less expensive and invasive methods, and plasma biomarkers are the premium targets. In the current study, we utilized a single-blind comparison method; all the probable AD cases met the core clinical National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria and validated by PET-PiB. We used ultrasensitive immunomagnetic reduction (IMR) assays to measure plasma Abeta 42 and total-tau (t-tau) levels, in combination with different variables including Abeta42 x t-tau value, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). We used logistic regression to analyze the effect of all these variables in the algorism. Our results showed that (1) plasma Abeta42 and t-tau are efficient biomarkers for AD diagnosis using IMR platform, whereas Abeta42 x t-tau value is more efficient for discriminating control and AD; (2) in the control group, Abeta42 level and age demonstrated strong negative correlation; Abeta42 x t-tau value and age demonstrated significant negative correlation; (3) in the AD group, t-tau level and MMSE score demonstrated strong negative correlation; (4) using the model that Abeta42, Abeta42 x t-tau, and MoCA as the variable to generate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, cutoff value = 0.48, sensitivity = 0.973, specificity = 0.982, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.986, offered better categorical efficacy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC.

    "title": "Therapeutic Trem2 activation ameliorates amyloid-beta deposition and improves cognition in the 5XFAD model of amyloid deposition.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell-2 (TREM2) is a lipid and lipoprotein binding receptor expressed by cells of myeloid origin. Homozygous TREM2 mutations cause early onset progressive presenile dementia while heterozygous, point mutations triple the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although human genetic findings support the notion that loss of TREM2 function exacerbates neurodegeneration, it is not clear whether activation of TREM2 in a disease state would result in therapeutic benefits. To determine the viability of TREM2 activation as a therapeutic strategy, we sought to characterize an agonistic Trem2 antibody (AL002a) and test its efficacy and mechanism of action in an aggressive mouse model of amyloid deposition. METHODS: To determine whether agonism of Trem2 results in therapeutic benefits, we designed both intracranial and systemic administration studies. 5XFAD mice in the intracranial administration study were assigned to one of two injection groups: AL002a, a Trem2-agonizing antibody, or MOPC, an isotype-matched control antibody. Mice were then subject to a single bilateral intracranial injection into the frontal cortex and hippocampus and euthanized 72 h later. The tissue from the left hemisphere was histologically examined for amyloid-beta and microglia activation, whereas the tissue from the right hemisphere was used for biochemical analyses. Similarly, mice in the systemic administration study were randomized to one of the aforementioned injection groups and the assigned antibody was administered intraperitoneally once a week for 14 weeks. Mice underwent behavioral assessment between the 12- and 14-week timepoints and were euthanized 24 h after their final injection. The tissue from the left hemisphere was used for histological analyses whereas the tissue from the right hemisphere was used for biochemical analyses. RESULTS: Here, we show that chronic activation of Trem2, in the 5XFAD mouse model of amyloid deposition, leads to reversal of the amyloid-associated gene expression signature, recruitment of microglia to plaques, decreased amyloid deposition, and improvement in spatial learning and novel object recognition memory. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that Trem2 activators may be effective for the treatment of AD and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders.",

Abeta42 aggregation and fibrillation are very complex processes whose molecular mechanisms seem to depend on characteristics intrinsic to the peptide molecule, as well as extrinsic factors. Peptide concentration, mean pH and several substances, including metal ions, are principal extrinsic factors for the oligomerization process. Different metals affect the aggregation of the Abeta42 molecule, and their toxicity favours the misfolding and aggregation of the peptide. In this study, we evaluate the effect of different concentrations of Cd2+ and Hg2+ on the Abeta42 peptide in solution by different methods. The toxicity of Abeta42 was evaluated with the MTT assay, while the aggregation process was monitored by single-channel measurements, electrophoresis and western blot. Cd2+ and Hg2+ seem to favour the formation of high-molecular-weight aggregates, to decrease ion channel turnover inside the membrane and to significantly increase Abeta42 toxicity.",

Amyloid-beta is one of the important components of drusen, which leads to local inflammation. Furthermore, intracellular amyloid-beta disrupts tight junctions of the RPE. However, the intracellular mechanisms linking intracellular amyloid-beta and tight-junction disruption are not clear. In this study, intracellular amyloid-beta oligomers activated nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) p65, leading to the disorganization of tight junctions of the RPE in mice after subretinal injection of amyloid-beta. Amyloid-beta also triggered NF-kappaB activation in the RPE cells in confluent culture, which was inhibited by the suppression of the advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor. NF-kappaB inhibition by an IkappaB kinase inhibitor prevented the suppression of expression of tight-junction proteins, zonula occuludens-1 and occludin in RPE cells. In addition, tight-junction complexes remained intact in the RPE of mice with NF-kappaB inhibition, although there were intracellular amyloid-beta oligomers. These data suggested that NF-kappaB inhibition might be a therapeutic approach to prevent amyloid-beta-mediated tight-junction disruption.",

Linear regression models estimated the effect of sex on FTP-signal for each ROI after adjusting for age and cohort. We also examined interactions between sex*Abeta-PET positive / negative (+ / -) and sex*apolipoprotein epsilon4 (APOEepsilon4) status. Linear mixed models estimated the moderating effect of sex on the relationship between a composite of sex-differentiated tau ROIs and cognitive decline. RESULTS: Women showed significantly higher FTP-signals than men across multiple regions of the cortical mantle (p < 0.007). beta-amyloid (Abeta)-moderated sex differences in tau signal were localized to medial and inferio-lateral temporal regions (p < 0.007); Abeta + women exhibited greater FTP-signal than other groups. APOEepsilon4-moderated sex differences in FTP-signal were only found in the lateral occipital lobe. Women with higher FTP-signals in composite ROI exhibited faster cognitive decline than men (p = 0.04). INTERPRETATION: Tau vulnerability in women is not just limited to the medial temporal lobe and significantly contributed to greater risk of faster cognitive decline. Interactive effects of sex and Abeta were predominantly localized in the temporal lobe, however, sex differences in extra-temporal tau highlights the possibility of accelerated tau proliferation in women with the onset of clinical symptomatology.

With the goal of designing new imaging agents radiolabeled with positron-emitting copper-64 radionuclides that bind to amyloid-beta plaques, a family of bis(thiosemicarbazone) ligands with appended substituted stilbenyl functional groups has been prepared. The ligands form charge-neutral and stable complexes with copper(II). The new ligands can be radiolabeled with copper-64 at room temperature. Two lead complexes were demonstrated to bind to amyloid-beta plaques present in post-mortem brain tissue from subjects with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease and crossed the blood-brain barrier in mice.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, and its etiology and pathogenesis are not fully understood. Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) has many pharmacological activities, but there are few reports about its role in AD. Using the common AD model APP/PS1 mice, it was found that the expression of Keap1 (a negative regulatory factor of Nrf2), the protein level of cytoplasmic Nrf2 and the content of MDA were increased significantly, while the mRNA level of Nrf2, the expression of Nrf2 in nucleus and the contents of SOD and GSH-Px were decreased significantly. APS treatment significantly increased the expression of Nrf2 in the nucleus but decreased its expression in the cytoplasm, and restored the expression levels of Keap1, SOD, GSH-Px and MDA. When APP/PS1 mice were treated with APS and injected with Nrf2 siRNA, the down-regulation of Nrf2 expression significantly blocked the regulation of APS on oxidative stress. Continuing to test the physiological function of AD mice showed that the spatial learning and memory abilities of APP/PS1 mice were impaired, the apoptosis of brain cells and the content of beta-amyloid (Abeta) were significantly increased. APS treatment significantly improved the cognitive ability of APP/PS1 mice, reduced apoptosis and the accumulation of Abeta, but the above effects of APS were blocked by Nrf2 siRNA injection. Therefore, APS can activate Nrf2 pathway to improve the physiological function of AD mice, which may have important clinical application value.",

    "title": "Gene therapy for Alzheimer's disease targeting CD33 reduces amyloid beta accumulation and neuroinflammation.",
    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a key contributor to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). CD33 (Siglec-3) is a transmembrane sialic acid-binding receptor on the surface of microglial cells. CD33 is upregulated on microglial cells from post-mortem AD patient brains, and high levels of CD33 inhibit uptake and clearance of amyloid beta (Abeta) in microglial cell cultures. Furthermore, knockout of CD33 reduces amyloid plaque burden in mouse models of AD. Here, we tested whether a gene therapy strategy to reduce CD33 on microglia in AD could decrease Abeta plaque load. Intracerebroventricular injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-based system encoding an artificial microRNA targeting CD33 (miRCD33) into APP/PS1 mice reduced CD33 mRNA and TBS-soluble Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels in brain extracts. Treatment of APP/PS1 mice with miRCD33 vector at an early age (2 months) was more effective at reducing Abeta plaque burden than intervening at later times (8 months). Furthermore, early intervention downregulated several microglial receptor transcripts (e.g. CD11c, CD47 and CD36) and pro-inflammatory activation genes (e.g. Tlr4 and Il1b). Marked reductions in the chemokine Ccl2 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine Tnfalpha were observed at the protein level in the brain of APP/PS1 mice treated with miRCD33 vector. Overall, our data indicate that CD33 is a viable target for AAV-based knockdown strategies to reduce AD pathology.

OBJECTIVE: In our work we found that biological sex influences the effect of amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42) monomers on pathological tau conformational change. METHODS: In this study we used transgenic mice expressing the wild-type human tau (hTau) which were subjected to intraventricular (ICV) injections of Abeta peptides in nanomolar concentration. RESULTS: We found that Abeta42 produces pathological conformational changes and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein in male or ovariectomized female mice but not in control females. The treatment of ovariectomized females with estradiol replacement protects against the pathological conformation of tau and seems to be mediated by antioxidant activity as well as the ability to modulate the expression of miRNA 218 linked to tau phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that factors as age, reproductive stage, hormone levels, and the interplay with other risk factors should be considered in women, in order to identify the best appropriate therapeutic approach in prevention of cognitive impairment.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the phosphorylated tau interactome. To this end, we used two complementary proteomics approaches: (i) quantitative proteomics was performed on neurofibrillary tangles microdissected from patients with advanced Alzheimer's disease; and (ii) affinity purification-mass spectrometry was used to identify which of these proteins specifically bound to phosphorylated tau. We identified 542 proteins in neurofibrillary tangles. This included the abundant detection of many proteins known to be present in neurofibrillary tangles such as tau, ubiquitin, neurofilament proteins and apolipoprotein E. Affinity purification-mass spectrometry confirmed that 75 proteins present in neurofibrillary tangles interacted with PHF1-immunoreactive phosphorylated tau. Twenty-nine of these proteins have been previously associated with phosphorylated tau, therefore validating our proteomic approach. More importantly, 34 proteins had previously been associated with total tau, but not yet linked directly to phosphorylated tau (e.g. synaptic protein VAMP2, vacuolar-ATPase subunit ATP6V0D1); therefore, we provide new evidence that they directly interact with phosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we also identified 12 novel proteins, not previously known to be physiologically or pathologically associated with tau (e.g. RNA binding protein HNRNPA1). Network analysis showed that the phosphorylated tau interactome was enriched in proteins involved in the protein ubiquitination pathway and phagosome maturation. Importantly, we were able to pinpoint specific proteins that phosphorylated tau interacts with in these pathways for the first time, therefore providing novel potential pathogenic mechanisms that can be explored in future studies. Combined, our results reveal new potential drug targets for the treatment of tauopathies and provide insight into how phosphorylated tau mediates its toxicity in Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Age and the association between apolipoprotein E genotype and Alzheimer disease: A cerebrospinal fluid biomarker-based case-control study.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene and increasing age are two of the most important known risk factors for developing Alzheimer disease (AD). The diagnosis of AD based on clinical symptoms alone is known to have poor specificity; recently developed diagnostic criteria based on biomarkers that reflect underlying AD neuropathology allow better assessment of the strength of the associations of risk factors with AD. Accordingly, we examined the global and age-specific association between APOE genotype and AD by using the A/T/N classification, relying on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of beta-amyloid peptide (A, beta-amyloid deposition), phosphorylated tau (T, pathologic tau), and total tau (N, neurodegeneration) to identify patients with AD. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This case-control study included 1,593 white AD cases (55.4% women; mean age 72.8 [range = 44-96] years) with abnormal values of CSF biomarkers from nine European memory clinics and the American Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. A total of 11,723 dementia-free controls (47.1% women; mean age 65.6 [range = 44-94] years) were drawn from two longitudinal cohort studies (Whitehall II and Three-City), in which incident cases of dementia over the follow-up were excluded from the control population. Odds ratio (OR) and population attributable fraction (PAF) for AD associated with APOE genotypes were determined, overall and by 5-year age categories. In total, 63.4% of patients with AD and 22.6% of population controls carried at least one APOE epsilon4 allele. Compared with non-epsilon4 carriers, heterozygous epsilon4 carriers had a 4.6 (95% confidence interval 4.1-5.2; p < 0.001) and epsilon4/epsilon4 homozygotes a 25.4 (20.4-31.2; p < 0.001) higher OR of AD in unadjusted analysis. This association was modified by age (p for interaction < 0.001). The PAF associated with carrying at least one epsilon4 allele was greatest in the 65-70 age group (69.7%) and weaker before 55 years (14.2%) and after 85 years (22.6%). The protective effect of APOE epsilon2 allele for AD was unaffected by age. Main study limitations are that analyses were based on white individuals and AD cases were drawn from memory centers, which may not be representative of the general population of patients with AD. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that AD diagnosis based on biomarkers was associated with APOE epsilon4 carrier status, with a higher OR than previously reported from studies based on only clinical AD criteria. This association differs according to age, with the strongest effect at 65-70 years. These findings highlight the need for early interventions for dementia prevention to mitigate the effect of APOE epsilon4 at the population level.",

    "abstract": "The abnormal folding and aggregation of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) is the main reason for the occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The discovery of novel inhibitors against Abeta aggregation is still the current research focus. Herein, we report the inhibitory effect of ulvan, an acidic polysaccharide from green algae of the genus Ulva, against Abeta fibrillation using thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence and atomic force microscopy (AFM) assays. It is shown that ulvan effectively inhibits Abeta fibrillogenesis in a concentration-dependent manner and actively inhibits the formation of A11-reactive Abeta oligomers, the most toxic Abeta species. The circular dichroism spectrum reveals that ulvan blocks the conformational transition of Abeta40 from the initial random coil to a beta-sheet structure, but it only delays the conformational transition of Abeta42. It is also found that ulvan greatly reduces Abeta-induced cytotoxicity by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In addition, ulvan effectively downregulates intracellular reactive oxygen species production and protects PC12 cells from the damage caused by Abeta fibrillation. Moreover, ulvan disaggregates preformed mature fibrils into off-pathway oligomers and greatly decreases their associated cytotoxicity, as revealed using ThT fluorescence, AFM, MTT, and dot-blotting assays. The above results not only fully describe the inhibitory effect of ulvan on Abeta fibrillation and its related cytotoxicity but also provide novel ideas for the development of functional food ingredients from seaweed to treat AD.",

    "abstract": "High levels of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide have been shown to disrupt neuronal function and induce hyperexcitability, but it is unclear what effects Abeta-associated hyperexcitability may have on tauopathy pathogenesis or propagation in vivo. Using a novel transgenic mouse line to model the impact of human APP (hAPP)/Abeta accumulation on tauopathy in the entorhinal cortex-hippocampal (EC-HIPP) network, we demonstrate that hAPP overexpression aggravates EC-Tau aggregation and accelerates pathological tau spread into the hippocampus. In vivo recordings revealed a strong role for hAPP/Abeta, but not tau, in the emergence of EC neuronal hyperactivity and impaired theta rhythmicity. Chronic chemogenetic attenuation of EC neuronal hyperactivity led to reduced hAPP/Abeta accumulation and reduced pathological tau spread into downstream hippocampus. These data strongly support the hypothesis that in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Abeta-associated hyperactivity accelerates the progression of pathological tau along vulnerable neuronal circuits, and demonstrates the utility of chronic, neuromodulatory approaches in ameliorating AD pathology in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Serum amyloid A (SAA) is one of the most important precursor amyloid proteins and plays a vital step in AA amyloidosis, although the underlying aggregation mechanism has not been elucidated. Since SAA aggregation is a key step in this pathogenesis, inhibitors are useful to prevent and treat AA amyloidosis, serving as tools to investigate the pathogenic mechanism. In this study, we showed that rosmarinic acid (RA), which is a well-known inhibitor of the aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta), displayed inhibitory activity against SAA aggregation in vitro using a microliter-scale high-throughput screening (MSHTS) system with quantum-dot nanoprobes. Therefore, we evaluated the amyloid aggregation inhibitory activity of blood and the deposition of SAA in organs by feeding mice with Melissa officinalis extract (ME) containing RA as an active substance. Interestingly, the inhibitory activity of ME-fed mice sera for SAA and Abeta aggregation, measured with the MSHTS system, was higher than that of the control group. The amount of amyloid deposition in the organs of ME-fed mice was lower than that in the control group, suggesting that the SAA aggregation inhibitory activity of serum is associated with SAA deposition. These results suggest that dietary intake of RA-containing ME enhanced amyloid aggregation inhibitory activity of blood and suppressed SAA deposition in organs. This study also demonstrated that the MSHTS system could be applied to in vitro screening and to monitor comprehensive activity of metabolized foods adsorbed by blood.",

To enhance the affinity of BSBps to the Abeta42 aggregates, we designed and synthesized beta-strand-fixed peptides (BSFps) whose side chains were cross-linked by ring closing metathesis. Conformation analysis verified that the designed peptides could be fixed in beta-strand conformation. Among the synthesized pentapeptides, 1 and 12, whose side chains of 2nd and 4th residues were cross-linked, significantly inhibited the aggregation of Abeta42. This suggested that beta-strand-fixation of BSBps could enhance their inhibitory activity against the Abeta42 aggregation. However, pentapeptides 1 and 12 had little effect on morphology of Abeta42 aggregates (fibrils) and neurotoxicity of Abeta42 against SH-SY5Y cells.",

However, there are no effective treatments and even no established confirmatory diagnostic tools for the disease. Amyloid beta (Abeta) aggregation in the brain is the best-known pathognomonic mechanism of AD, so various methods for Abeta detection have been developed for the diagnosis of this disease. We synthesized two novel, ultra-sensitive peptide probes specialized in detecting Abeta aggregates, and examined their potential for future diagnostic application. The peptides are produced through phage high-throughput screening (HTS) and amplified through a serial process called biopanning, which is a repeating method of elution and amplification of probes. We picked phages specific for amyloid from two kinds of phage display. The synthesized peptides were confirmed to have excellent binding affinity to Abeta aggregates, by immunohistochemical staining and western blotting using the brains of 3X transgenic (Tg) AD mice at different stages (5-7, 12-17 months old) of AD severity. In the present study, it was confirmed that newly developed amyloid-binding peptides could be used as novel probes for the detection of Abeta aggregates, which can be used for clinical diagnosis of AD in the future.",

TREM2 requires a stable interaction with DAP12 in the membrane to initiate signaling, which is terminated by TREM2 ectodomain shedding and subsequent intramembrane cleavage by gamma-secretase. To understand the structural basis for the specificity of the intramembrane cleavage event, we determined the solution structure of the TREM2 transmembrane helix (TMH). Caused by the presence of a charged amino acid in the membrane region, the TREM2-TMH adopts a kinked structure with increased flexibility. Charge removal leads to TMH stabilization and reduced dynamics, similar to its structure in complex with DAP12. Strikingly, these dynamical features match with the site of the initial gamma-secretase cleavage event. These data suggest an unprecedented cleavage mechanism by gamma-secretase where flexible TMH regions act as key determinants of substrate cleavage specificity.",

    "title": "Impact of Four Common Hydrogels on Amyloid-beta (Abeta) Aggregation and Cytotoxicity: Implications for 3D Models of Alzheimer's Disease.",
    "abstract": "The physiochemical properties of hydrogels utilized in 3D culture can be used to modulate cell phenotype and morphology with a striking resemblance to cellular processes that occur in vivo. Indeed, research areas including regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, in vitro cancer models, and stem cell differentiation have readily utilized 3D biomaterials to investigate cell biological questions. However, cells are only one component of this biomimetic milieu. In many models of disease such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) that could benefit from the in vivo-like cell morphology associated with 3D culture, other aspects of the disease such as protein aggregation have yet to be methodically considered in this 3D context. A hallmark of AD is the accumulation of the peptide amyloid-beta (Abeta), whose aggregation is associated with neurotoxicity. We have previously demonstrated the attenuation of Abeta cytotoxicity when cells were cultured within type I collagen hydrogels versus on 2D substrates. In this work, we investigated the extent to which this phenomenon is conserved when Abeta is confined within hydrogels of varying physiochemical properties, notably mesh size and bioactivity. We investigated the Abeta structure and aggregation kinetics in solution and hydrogels composed of type I collagen, agarose, hyaluronic acid, and polyethylene glycol using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and thioflavin T assays. Our results reveal that all hydrogels tested were associated with enhanced Abeta aggregation and Abeta cytotoxicity attenuation. We suggest that confinement itself imparts a profound effect, possibly by stabilizing Abeta structures and shifting the aggregate equilibrium toward larger species. If this phenomenon of altered protein aggregation in 3D hydrogels can be generalized to other contexts including the in vivo environment, it may be necessary to reevaluate aspects of protein aggregation disease models used for drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) fragments of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in brain parenchyma is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). APP can be cleaved into Abeta on late endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVBs). E3 ubiquitin ligases have been linked to Abeta production, but specific E3 ligases associated with APP ubiquitination that may affect targeting of APP to endosomes have not yet been described. Using cultured cortical neurons isolated from rat pups, we reconstituted APP movement into the internal vesicles (ILVs) of MVBs. Loss of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) components inhibited APP movement into ILVs and increased endosomal Abeta42 generation, implying a requirement for APP ubiquitination. We identified an ESCRT-binding and APP-interacting endosomal E3 ubiquitin ligase, ubiquitination factor E4B (UBE4B) that regulates APP ubiquitination. Depleting UBE4B in neurons inhibited APP ubiquitination and internalization into MVBs, resulting in increased endosomal Abeta42 levels and increased neuronal secretion of Abeta42. When we examined AD brains, we found levels of the UBE4B-interacting ESCRT component, hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs), were significantly decreased in AD brains. These data suggest that ESCRT components critical for membrane protein sorting in the endocytic pathway are altered in AD. These results indicate that the molecular machinery underlying endosomal trafficking of APP, including the ubiquitin ligase UBE4B, regulates Abeta levels and may play an essential role in AD progression.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid precursor protein (APP), a central molecule in Alzheimer's disease (AD), has physiological roles in cell adhesion and signaling, migration, neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis. Intracellular adapter proteins mediate the function of transmembrane proteins. Fe65 (also known as APBB1) is a major APP-binding protein. Regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) by gamma-secretase releases the APP intracellular domain (AICD), together with the interacting proteins, from the membrane. We studied the impact of the Fe65 family (Fe65, and its homologs Fe65L1 and Fe65L2, also known as APBB2 and APBB3, respectively) on the nuclear signaling function of the AICD. All Fe65 family members increased amyloidogenic processing of APP, generating higher levels of beta-cleaved APP stubs and AICD. However, Fe65 was the only family member supporting AICD translocation to nuclear spots and its transcriptional activity. Using a recently established transcription assay, we dissected the transcriptional activity of Fe65 and provide strong evidence that Fe65 represents a transcription factor. We show that Fe65 relies on the lysine acetyltransferase Tip60 (also known as KAT5) for nuclear translocation. Furthermore, inhibition of APP cleavage reduces nuclear Tip60 levels, but this does not occur in Fe65-knockout cells. The rate of APP cleavage therefore regulates the nuclear translocation of AICD-Fe65-Tip60 (AFT) complexes, to promote transcription by Fe65.",

We set up a case-control study to investigate the association between long-term work-induced sleep disruption, cognitive function, and brain amyloid-beta burden. METHODS: Nineteen male maritime pilots (aged 48-60 years) with chronic work-related sleep disruption and a sex-, age-, and education-matched control sample (n = 16, aged 50-60 years) with normal sleep completed the study. Primary sleep disorders were ruled out with in-lab polysomnography. Additional sleep measurements were obtained at home using actigraphy, sleep-wake logs, and a single-lead EEG device. Cognitive function was assessed with a neuropsychological test battery, sensitive to early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Brain amyloid-beta burden was assessed in maritime pilots using 18F-flutemetamol amyloid PET-CT. RESULTS: Maritime pilots reported significantly worse sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) = 8.8 +- 2.9) during work weeks, compared to controls (PSQI = 3.2 +- 1.4; 95% CI 0.01 to 2.57; p = 0.049). This was confirmed with actigraphy-based sleep efficiency (86% +- 3.8 vs. 89.3% +- 4.3; 95% CI 0.43 to 6.03; p = 0.03). Home-EEG recordings showed less total sleep time (TST) and deep sleep time (DST) during work weeks compared to rest weeks (TST 318.56 (250.21-352.93) vs. TST 406.17 (340-425.98); p = 0.001; DST 36.75 (32.30-58.58) vs. DST 51.34 (48.37-69.30); p = 0.005)). There were no differences in any of the cognitive domains between the groups. For brain amyloid-beta levels, mean global cortical standard uptake value ratios of 18F-flutemetamol were all in the normal range (1.009 +- 0.059; 95% CI 0.980 to 1.037), confirmed by visual reads. CONCLUSIONS: Capitalizing on the particular work-rest schedule of maritime pilots, this study with a small sample size observed that long-term intermittent sleep disruption had no effects on global brain amyloid-beta levels or cognitive function.",

    "title": "Regional gray matter-dedicated SUVR with 3D-MRI detects positive amyloid deposits in equivocal amyloid PET images.",
    "abstract": "PURPOSE: It is usually easy to judge whether amyloid PET images should be interpreted as positive or negative for amyloid deposits by visual inspection or quantitative measurement standard uptake value ratio (SUVR), but the findings are equivocal in some cases. As conventional mean cortical SUVR (mcSUVR) measures accumulation in both gray matter (GM) and white matter, it may mis-estimate amyloid deposits. The purpose of the study was to develop a regional GM-dedicated SUVR measuring (GMSUVR) system for amyloid PET images with 3D-MRI, and evaluate its utility for detecting amyloid deposits in equivocal cases. METHODS: Of 126 subjects who underwent amyloid PET with 11C-PiB and 3D-MRI, the area of amyloid-positive regions and the critical regional GMSUVR thresholds were first determined in 15 amyloid-positive and 15 amyloid-negative patients, using the automatic volumetric measurement of segmented brain images system. We then tested 36 amyloid-negative, 60 amyloid-positive, and 13 equivocal subjects with this GMSUVR system and with conventional mcSUVR. RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 100%, 92%, 97%, 95%, and 100% for the GMSUVR system; and 97%, 86%, 93%, 92% and 94%, respectively, for mcSUVR. In 24 cases in which the findings were equivocal or discordant, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV were all 100% for the GMSUVR system; and were 90%, 33%, 83%, 90%, and 33%, respectively, for mcSUVR. CONCLUSION: The regional GMSUVR measurement method was well able to discriminate between amyloid-positive and -negative subjects, even in cases where amyloid deposition was equivocal.",

    "title": "LRRK2 and Rab10 coordinate macropinocytosis to mediate immunological responses in phagocytes.",
    "abstract": "Genetic variation in LRRK2 associates with the susceptibility to Parkinson's disease, Crohn's disease, and mycobacteria infection. High expression of LRRK2 and its substrate Rab10 occurs in phagocytic cells in the immune system. In mouse and human primary macrophages, dendritic cells, and microglia-like cells, we find that Rab10 specifically regulates a specialized form of endocytosis known as macropinocytosis, without affecting phagocytosis or clathrin-mediated endocytosis. LRRK2 phosphorylates cytoplasmic PI(3,4,5)P3-positive GTP-Rab10, before EEA1 and Rab5 recruitment to early macropinosomes occurs. Macropinosome cargo in macrophages includes CCR5, CD11b, and MHCII, and LRRK2-phosphorylation of Rab10 potently blocks EHBP1L1-mediated recycling tubules and cargo turnover. EHBP1L1 overexpression competitively inhibits LRRK2-phosphorylation of Rab10, mimicking the effects of LRRK2 kinase inhibition in promoting cargo recycling. Both Rab10 knockdown and LRRK2 kinase inhibition potently suppress the maturation of macropinosome-derived CCR5-loaded signaling endosomes that are critical for CCL5-induced immunological responses that include Akt activation and chemotaxis. These data support a novel signaling axis in the endolysosomal system whereby LRRK2-mediated Rab10 phosphorylation stalls vesicle fast recycling to promote PI3K-Akt immunological responses.",

    "title": "Regional correlation of biochemical measures of amyloid and tau phosphorylation in the brain.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathologic change is characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that consist of aggregated amyloid beta (Abeta) and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins (p-tau), respectively. Although the global relationship between Abeta and p-tau has been studied for decades, it is still unclear whether a regional correlation exists between Abeta and p-tau in the human brain. Recent studies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have suggested that tau phosphorylation at specific sites such as T217 is modified at an early stage of AD when amyloid plaques become detectable. We applied biochemical and mass spectrometry methods in human brain samples with and without Abeta plaque pathology to measure site-specific phosphorylation occupancies in soluble and insoluble tau. Our quantitative results identified multiple residues specifically hyper-phosphorylated in AD, including at sites T111, T153, S184 (or S185), T205, S208, T217, S262, and S285 in brain soluble tau. In contrast, the most enriched phosphorylated residues in brain insoluble tau were T111, S113, T153, T181, S199, S202, T205, T217, T231, S262, and S396. Tau phosphorylation occupancies in the insoluble fraction were relatively constant across brain regions, suggesting that tau has a consistent phosphorylation pattern once it has aggregated into NFTs. We did not find regional association between Abeta42 and insoluble tau. However, the phosphorylation profile of soluble tau in AD brain was highly correlated to that in AD CSF, which was analyzed in a previous study. We also found a higher regional association between total Abeta42 and soluble tau phosphorylation occupancy at residues T111, T153 and T217 in the brain. This study provides insights into regional interactions between amyloidosis and specific tau phosphorylated residues in the human brain and may explain the specific increases of tau species phosphorylation observed in AD CSF.",

Molecular tools to restore this balance are highly desirable. Here, we designed and characterized CPTX, a synthetic synaptic organizer combining structural elements from cerebellin-1 and neuronal pentraxin-1. CPTX can interact with presynaptic neurexins and postsynaptic AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors and induced the formation of excitatory synapses both in vitro and in vivo. CPTX restored synaptic functions, motor coordination, spatial and contextual memories, and locomotion in mouse models for cerebellar ataxia, Alzheimer's disease, and spinal cord injury, respectively. Thus, CPTX represents a prototype for structure-guided biologics that can efficiently repair or remodel neuronal circuits.",

Quantitative analysis of Abeta42 monomers or oligomers bound to the membrane of neuro-2a cells was also performed, and laser confocal microscopy was employed to assess endocytosis of FITC-Abeta42 monomers or oligomers by neuro-2a cells. We found that the binding capacity of Abeta42 to membrane lipids was weak and that the amount of Abeta42 bound to membrane lipids was low. Moreover, clathrin-mediated endocytosis of Abeta42 oligomers by neuro-2a cells was observed. Endocytosis serves as a key mode of interaction between extracellular Abeta42 and neurons.

We documented our experience of typing 16,175 amyloidosis specimens over an 11-year period from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2018. RESULTS: We identified 21 established amyloid types, including AL (n=9542; 59.0%), ATTR (n=4600; 28.4%), ALECT2 (n=511; 3.2%), AA (n=463; 2.9%), AH (n=367; 2.3%), AIns (n=182; 1.2%), KRT5-14 (n=94; <1%), AFib (n=71; <1%), AApoAIV (n=57; <1%), AApoA1 (n=56; <1%), AANF (n=47; <1%), Abeta2M (n=38; <1%), ASem1 (n=34; <1%), AGel (n=29; <1%), TGFB1 (n=29; <1%), ALys (n=15; <1%), AIAPP (n=13; <1%), AApoCII (n=11; <1%), APro (n=8; <1%), AEnf (n=6; <1%), and ACal (n=2; <1%). We developed the first comprehensive organ-by-type map showing the relative frequency of 21 amyloid types in 31 different organs, and the first type-by-organ map showing organ tropism of 18 rare types. Using a modified bioinformatics pipeline, we detected amino acid substitutions in cases of hereditary amyloidosis with 100% specificity.

    "abstract": "The link between cholesterol homeostasis and cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and how this relationship relates to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, is still unknown. Cellular cholesterol levels are regulated through crosstalk between the plasma membrane (PM), where most cellular cholesterol resides, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the protein machinery that regulates cholesterol levels resides. The intracellular transport of cholesterol from the PM to the ER is believed to be activated by a lipid-sensing peptide(s) in the ER that can cluster PM-derived cholesterol into transient detergent-resistant membrane domains (DRMs) within the ER, also called the ER regulatory pool of cholesterol. When formed, these cholesterol-rich domains in the ER maintain cellular homeostasis by inducing cholesterol esterification as a mechanism of detoxification while attenuating its de novo synthesis. In this manuscript, we propose that the 99-aa C-terminal fragment of APP (C99), when delivered to the ER for cleavage by gamma-secretase, acts as a lipid-sensing peptide that forms regulatory DRMs in the ER, called mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM). Our data in cellular AD models indicates that increased levels of uncleaved C99 in the ER, an early phenotype of the disease, upregulates the formation of these transient DRMs by inducing the internalization of extracellular cholesterol and its trafficking from the PM to the ER. These results suggest a novel role for C99 as a mediator of cholesterol disturbances in AD, potentially explaining early hallmarks of the disease.",

In the present study, we applied a comprehensive immunohistochemical approach to investigate the structural alterations in the NVU across different Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathological stages. Post-mortem human cortical and hippocampal samples derived from AD patients and non-demented elderly control individuals were immunostained using a panel of markers representing specific components of the NVU including Collagen IV (basement membrane), PDGFR-beta (pericytes), GFAP (astrocytes), Iba1 (microglia), MRC1 (perivascular macrophages) and lectin as an endothelial cell label. Astrocytes (GFAP) and microglia (Iba1) were quantified both in the whole visual-field and specifically within the NVU, and the sample set was additionally analyzed using anti-tau (AT8) and three different anti-Abeta (clones G2-10, G2-11, 4G8) antibodies. Analyses of lectin labeled sections showed an altered vascular distribution in AD patients as revealed by a reduced nearest distance between capillaries. Within the NVU, a Braak-stage dependent reduction in pericyte coverage was identified as the earliest structural alteration during AD progression. In comparison to non-demented elderly controls, AD patients showed a significantly higher astrocyte coverage within the NVU, which was paralleled by a reduced microglial coverage around capillaries. Assessment of perivascular macrophages moreover demonstrated a relocation of these cells from leptomeningeal arteries to penetrating parenchymal vessels in AD patients. Collectively, the results of our study represent a comprehensive first in-depth analysis of AD-related structural changes in the NVU and suggest distinct alterations in all components of the NVU during AD progression.",

    "title": "Amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain-dependent regulation of FOXO3a inhibits adult hippocampal neurogenesis.",
    "abstract": "The amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain (AICD) is a metabolic by-product of APP produced through sequential proteolytic cleavage by alpha-, beta-, and gamma-secretases. The interaction between AICD and Fe65 has been reported to impair adult neurogenesis in vivo. However, the exact role of AICD in mediating neural stem cell fate remains unclear. To identify the role of AICD in neuronal proliferation and differentiation, as well as to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of AICD in neurogenesis, we first generated a mouse model expressing the Rosa26-based AICD transgene. AICD overexpression did not alter the spatiotemporal expression pattern of full-length APP or accumulation of its metabolites. In addition, AICD decreased the newly generated neural progenitor cell (NPC) pool, inhibited the proliferation and differentiation efficiency of NPCs, and increased cell death both in vitro and in vivo. Given that abnormal neurogenesis is often associated with depression-like behavior in adult mice, we conducted a forced swim test and tail suspension test with AICD mice and found a depression-like behavioral phenotype in AICD transgenic mice. Moreover, AICD stimulated FOXO3a transcriptional activation, which in turn negatively regulated AICD. In addition, functional loss of FOXO3a in NPCs derived from the hippocampal dentate gyrus of adult AICD transgenic mice rescued neurogenesis defects. AICD also increased the mRNA expression of FOXO3a target genes related to neurogenesis and cell death. These results suggest that FOXO3a is the functional target of AICD in neurogenesis regulation. Our study reveals the role of AICD in mediating neural stem cell fate to maintain homeostasis during brain development via interaction with FOXO3a.",

    "title": "Amyloid-beta regulates gap junction protein connexin 43 trafficking in cultured primary astrocytes.",
    "abstract": "Altered expression and function of astroglial gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) has increasingly been associated to neurotoxicity in Alzheimer disease (AD). Although earlier studies have examined the effect of increased beta-amyloid (Abeta) on Cx43 expression and function leading to neuronal damage, underlying mechanisms by which Abeta modulates Cx43 in astrocytes remain elusive. Here, using mouse primary astrocyte cultures, we have examined the cellular processes by which Abeta can alter Cx43 gap junctions. We show that Abeta25-35 impairs functional gap junction coupling yet increases hemichannel activity. Interestingly, Abeta25-35 increased the intracellular pool of Cx43 with a parallel decrease in gap junction assembly at the surface. Intracellular Cx43 was found to be partly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum-associated cell compartments. However, forward trafficking of the newly synthesized Cx43 that already reached the Golgi was not affected in Abeta25-35-exposed astrocytes. Supporting this, treatment with 4-phenylbutyrate, a well-known chemical chaperone that improves trafficking of several transmembrane proteins, restored Abeta-induced impaired gap junction coupling between astrocytes. We further show that interruption of Cx43 endocytosis in Abeta25-35-exposed astrocytes resulted in their retention at the cell surface in the form of functional gap junctions indicating that Abeta25-35 causes rapid internalization of Cx43 gap junctions. Additionally, in silico molecular docking suggests that Abeta can bind favorably to Cx43. Our study thus provides novel insights into the cellular mechanisms by which Abeta modulates Cx43 function in astrocytes, the basic understanding of which is vital for the development of alternative therapeutic strategy targeting connexin channels in AD.",

    "abstract": "Vascular dementia (VD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, and the cognitive dysfunction is a major manifestation of VD. Lots of evidences showed that beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition and neuroinflammation act as vital elements in the progress of VD. The previous studies showed that osthole (OST) can improve the cognitive function of VD and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the effect of OST on Abeta in VD brain is still unclear. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) of rats were used to investigate the effect of OST on Abeta through nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in this study. Morris Water Maze and Y-maze were used to test the spatial learning, memory and working abilities. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and Nissl staining were used to observe the morphology and number of hippocampal neurons. Immunofluorescence staining was used to observe the number of microglia activated. Western blot was used to detect the expression of proteins. The study results showed that OST obviously enhanced the spatial learning, memory and working abilities induced by modified bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) in rats, improved the pathological damage of hippocampal neurons induced by BCCAO in rats, inhibited the activation of microglia induced by BCCAO in rats. Furthermore, this study also discovered that OST reduced Abeta deposition in VD hippocampus via inhibition the NLRP3 inflammasome. Together, these results suggest that OST reduces Abeta deposition via inhibition NLRP3 inflammasome in microglial in VD.",

Aggregation of specific peptides, like Abeta42 in AD and hIAPP in T2DM, causes cellular dysfunction resulting in the respective pathology. While these amyloidogenic proteins lack sequence homology, they all contain aromatic amino acids in their hydrophobic core that play a major role in their self-assembly. Targeting these aromatic residues by small molecules may be an attractive approach for inhibiting amyloid aggregation. Here, various biochemical and biophysical techniques revealed that a panel of tryptophan-galactosylamine conjugates significantly inhibit fibril formation of Abeta42 and hIAPP, and disassemble their pre-formed fibrils in a dose-dependent manner. They are also not toxic to mammalian cells and can reduce the cytotoxicity induced by Abeta42 and hIAPP aggregates. These tryptophan-galactosylamine conjugates can therefore serve as a scaffold for the development of therapeutics towards AD and T2DM.",

Here we identify interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) as a gamma-secretase modulatory protein, and establish a mechanism by which inflammation affects the generation of amyloid-beta. Inflammatory cytokines induce the expression of IFITM3 in neurons and astrocytes, which binds to gamma-secretase and upregulates its activity, thereby increasing the production of amyloid-beta. The expression of IFITM3 is increased with ageing and in mouse models that express familial Alzheimer's disease genes. Furthermore, knockout of IFITM3 reduces gamma-secretase activity and the formation of amyloid plaques in a transgenic mouse model (5xFAD) of early amyloid deposition. IFITM3 protein is upregulated in tissue samples from a subset of patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease that exhibit higher gamma-secretase activity. The amount of IFITM3 in the gamma-secretase complex has a strong and positive correlation with gamma-secretase activity in samples from patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. These findings reveal a mechanism in which gamma-secretase is modulated by neuroinflammation via IFITM3 and the risk of Alzheimer's disease is thereby increased.",

Calcium is required for the fusion and trafficking of vesicles. Previously, we demonstrated that Sec31A, a main component for coat protein complex II (COPII) vesicles at ER exit sites (ERES), is modulated by O-GlcNAcylation. O-GlcNAcylation, a unique and dynamic protein glycosylation process, modulates the formation of COPII vesicles. RESULTS: In this study, we observed that disrupted calcium levels affected the formation of COPII vesicles in ERES through calcium-triggered O-GlcNAcylation of Sec31A. Additionally, we found that Abeta impaired ERES through Abeta-disturbed calcium homeostasis and O-GlcNAcylation of Sec31A in neuronal cells. Furthermore, we identified that Abeta disrupted the ribbon-like structure of Golgi. Golgi fragmentation by Abeta was rescued by up-regulation of O-GlcNAcylaion levels using Thiamet G (ThiG), an O-GlcNAcase inhibitor. Additionally, we observed that the Golgi reassembly stacking proteins having a function in Golgi stacking showed attenuation at COPII vesicles following Abeta treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that Abeta impaired Sec31A targeting to ERES through altered Sec31A O-GlcNAcylation triggered by disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis. SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of this study suggested that protection of ERES or Sec31 O-GlcNAcylation may offer a promising novel avenue for development of AD therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is associated with both familial and sporadic forms of Alzheimer's disease. Despite its importance, the role of APP family in neuronal function and survival remains unclear because of perinatal lethality exhibited by knockout mice lacking all three APP family members. Here we report that selective inactivation of APP family members in excitatory neurons of the postnatal forebrain results in neither cortical neurodegeneration nor increases in apoptosis and gliosis up to ~2 years of age. However, hippocampal synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory are impaired in these mutant mice. Furthermore, hippocampal neurons lacking APP family exhibit hyperexcitability, as evidenced by increased neuronal spiking in response to depolarizing current injections, whereas blockade of Kv7 channels mimics and largely occludes the effects of APP family inactivation. These findings demonstrate that APP family is not required for neuronal survival and suggest that APP family may regulate neuronal excitability through Kv7 channels.",

    "abstract": "Regulating amyloid beta (Abeta) pathology and neuroinflammatory responses holds promise for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative and/or neuroinflammation-related diseases. In this study, the effects of KVN93, an inhibitor of dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase-1A (DYRK1A), on cognitive function and Abeta plaque levels and the underlying mechanism of action were evaluated in 5x FAD mice (a mouse model of AD). KVN93 treatment significantly improved long-term memory by enhancing dendritic synaptic function. In addition, KVN93 significantly reduced Abeta plaque levels in 5x FAD mice by regulating levels of the Abeta degradation enzymes neprilysin (NEP) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). Moreover, Abeta-induced microglial and astrocyte activation were significantly suppressed in the KVN-treated 5xFAD mice. KVN93 altered neuroinflammation induced by LPS in microglial cells but not primary astrocytes by regulating TLR4/AKT/STAT3 signaling, and in wild-type mice injected with LPS, KVN93 treatment reduced microglial and astrocyte activation. Overall, these results suggest that the novel DYRK1A inhibitor KVN93 is a potential therapeutic drug for regulating cognitive/synaptic function, Abeta plaque load, and neuroinflammatory responses in the brain.",

    "title": "Ligand-based pharmacophore modelling and virtual screening for the identification of amyloid-beta diagnostic molecules.",
    "abstract": "Currently, only three molecules, flutemetamol, florbetaben and florbetapir, have been approved for clinical use towards the definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the clinically approved drugs' advantages, there still exists a need for new diagnostic molecules with improved properties (physicochemical and pharmacokinetic) in comparison to the current molecules in clinical use and research. In this work, we report a pharmacophore model and a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) model, constructed from a series of 166 amyloid beta diagnostic compounds (targeting Alzheimer's disease) with the purpose of identifying functional groups influencing and predicting bioactivity. Subsequently, pharmacophore based virtual screening and QSAR predictions were used to identify new amyloid beta diagnostic molecules. In addition, docking and molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to explore the type and nature of interactions required for ligands to bind effectively in the binding regions of amyloid beta fibrils (PDB 2MXU). In our findings, the highest-ranked 4 feature pharmacophore model possessed one hydrogen bond acceptor, one hydrophobic feature and two ring features (AHRR). Systematically, the same dataset of molecules used for pharmacophore modelling was used to generate an atom-based 3D QSAR hypothesis to illustrate the activity relationship of amyloid-beta diagnostic molecules. The partial least squares (PLS) 3D QSAR model obtained showed good correlation as indicated by respective statistical parameters, R^2, Q^2 and Pearson values of 0.76, 0.72 and 0.86 respectively. Virtual screening against ZINC15 database and the ChemBridge CNS-Set yielded 7 molecules, 4 of which had satisfactory ADME properties. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and pi-pi interactions are crucial towards the binding of ligands (as predicted by our pharmacophore and QSAR models) to amyloid beta fibrils. In conclusion, the findings of this work present a wealth of information that can be useful in future research towards identifying and design of new amyloid diagnostic molecules. The pharmacophore presented here can be used to filter independent databases to identify new structurally related molecules with improved activity whereas the QSAR model can be useful in predicting bioactivities of the predicted hits.",

In an effort to develop a label-free method for screening new anti-AD therapeutic agents, we show the use of a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) active substrate for detecting the interactions between Abeta peptides and spin-labeled fluorine (SLF), a peptide aggregation inhibitor. Changes in the peak positions and intensity ratios of two spectral peaks near 1600cm-1 and 2900cm-1 can be used to monitor the molecular interactions between SLF and Abeta.

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: PET is a useful tool for detecting the presence and extent of brain tau accumulation. However, most first-generation tau PET tracers are limited for high off-target binding and detection of tau in non-Alzheimer disease (AD). This study evaluated potential clinical applications of F-PI-2620 as a novel PET tracer with a high binding affinity for tau deposition in AD and non-AD tauopathies. METHODS: Twenty-six participants diagnosed with either mild cognitive impairment, probable AD, frontotemporal dementia, or parkinsonism, as well as healthy controls underwent a 60- to 90-minute brain PET scan after 7 mci (259 MBq) injection of F-PI-2620. Some participants had previous PET scans using F-THK-5351 or F-FP-CIT for dopamine transporter imaging. RESULTS: All participants showed no increase in off-target binding in basal ganglia on F-PI-2620 PET images, as noted for first-generation tau tracers. Abeta+ mild cognitive impairment or AD patients showed diverse cortical F-PI-2620 uptake in frontotemporoparietal cortex that correlated with Mini-Mental Status Examination (rho = -0.692, P = 0.013). Abeta+ Parkinson disease with dementia and (Abeta unknown) primary progressive aphasia patients also showed increased F-PI-2620 uptakes in the frontotemporoparietal cortex. Patients with parkinsonism showed increased uptakes in the pallidum compared with Abeta- healthy controls (left: 1.41 +- 0.14 vs 1.04 +- 0.13, P = 0.014; right: 1.18 +- 0.16 vs 0.95 +- 0.07, P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: F-PI-2620 PET might be a sensitive tool to detect cortical tau deposits in patients with Abeta+ AD and Abeta+ non-AD tauopathies. Furthermore, this study showed that \"off-target\" binding in the basal ganglia does not affect F-PI-2620.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between discordant beta-amyloid (Abeta) PET and CSF biomarkers at baseline and the emergence of tau pathology 5 years later. METHODS: We included 730 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants without dementia (282 cognitively normal, 448 mild cognitive impairment) with baseline [18F]florbetapir PET and CSF Abeta42 available. Abeta CSF/PET status was determined at baseline using established cutoffs. Longitudinal data were available for [18F]florbetapir (Abeta) PET (baseline to 4.3 +- 1.9 years), CSF (p)tau (baseline to 2.0 +- 0.1 years), cognition (baseline to 4.3 +- 2.0 years), and [18F]flortaucipir (tau) PET (measured 5.2 +- 1.2 years after baseline to 1.6 +- 0.7 years later). We used linear mixed modeling to study the association between Abeta CSF/PET status and tau pathology measured in CSF or using PET. We calculated the proportion of CSF+/PET- participants who during follow-up (1) progressed to Abeta CSF+/PET+ or (2) became tau-positive based on [18F]flortaucipir PET. RESULTS: Abeta CSF+/PET+ (n = 318) participants had elevated CSF (p)tau levels and worse cognitive performance at baseline, while CSF+/PET- (n = 80) participants were overall similar to the CSF-/PET- (N = 306) group. Five years after baseline, [18F]flortaucipir PET uptake in the CSF+/PET- group (1.20 +- 0.13) did not differ from CSF-/PET- (1.18 +- 0.08, p = 0.69), but was substantially lower than CSF+/PET+ (1.48 +- 0.44, p < 0.001). Of the CSF+/PET- participants, 21/64 (33%) progressed to Abeta CSF+/PET+, whereas only one (3%, difference p < 0.05) became tau-positive based on [18F]flortaucipir PET. CONCLUSIONS: Abeta load detectable by both CSF and PET seems to precede substantial tau deposition. Compared to participants with abnormal Abeta levels on both PET and CSF, the CSF+/PET- group has a distinctly better prognosis.",

    "title": "The Alzheimer's disease-associated protective Plcgamma2-P522R variant promotes immune functions.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Microglia-specific genetic variants are enriched in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), implicating a central role for alterations of the innate immune system in the disease etiology. A rare coding variant in the PLCG2 gene (rs72824905, p.P522R) expressed in myeloid lineage cells was recently identified and shown to reduce the risk for AD. METHODS: To assess the role of the protective variant in the context of immune cell functions, we generated a Plcgamma2-P522R knock-in (KI) mouse model using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. RESULTS: Functional analyses of macrophages derived from homozygous KI mice and wild type (WT) littermates revealed that the P522R variant potentiates the primary function of Plcgamma2 as a Pip2-metabolizing enzyme. This was associated with improved survival and increased acute inflammatory response of the KI macrophages. Enhanced phagocytosis was observed in mouse BV2 microglia-like cells overexpressing human PLCgamma2-P522R, but not in PLCgamma2-WT expressing cells. Immunohistochemical analyses did not reveal changes in the number or morphology of microglia in the cortex of Plcgamma2-P522R KI mice. However, the brain mRNA signature together with microglia-related PET imaging suggested enhanced microglial functions in Plcgamma2-P522R KI mice. CONCLUSION: The AD-associated protective Plcgamma2-P522R variant promotes protective functions associated with TREM2 signaling. Our findings provide further support for the idea that pharmacological modulation of microglia via TREM2-PLCgamma2 pathway-dependent stimulation may be a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins (PSENs) could potentially lead to the production of longer amyloidogenic Abeta peptides. Amongst these, Abeta1-43 is more prone to aggregation and has higher toxic properties than the long-known Abeta1-42. However, a direct effect on Abeta1-43 in biomaterials of individuals carrying genetic mutations in the known AD genes is yet to be determined. METHODS: N = 1431 AD patients (n = 280 early-onset (EO) and n = 1151 late-onset (LO) AD) and 809 control individuals were genetically screened for APP and PSENs. For the first time, Abeta1-43 levels were analysed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 38 individuals carrying pathogenic or unclear rare mutations or the common PSEN1 p.E318G variant and compared with Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 CSF levels. The soluble sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta species were also measured for the first time in mutation carriers. RESULTS: A known pathogenic mutation was identified in 5.7% of EOAD patients (4.6% PSEN1, 1.07% APP) and in 0.3% of LOAD patients. Furthermore, 12 known variants with unclear pathogenicity and 11 novel were identified. Pathogenic and unclear mutation carriers showed a significant reduction in CSF Abeta1-43 levels compared to controls (p = 0.037; < 0.001). CSF Abeta1-43 levels positively correlated with CSF Abeta1-42 in both pathogenic and unclear carriers and controls (all p < 0.001). The p.E318G carriers showed reduced Abeta1-43 levels (p < 0.001), though genetic association with AD was not detected. sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta CSF levels were significantly reduced in the group of unclear (p = 0.006; 0.005) and p.E318G carriers (p = 0.004; 0.039), suggesting their possible involvement in AD. Finally, using Abeta1-43 and Abeta1-42 levels, we could re-classify as \"likely pathogenic\" 3 of the unclear mutations. CONCLUSION: This is the first time that Abeta1-43 levels were analysed in CSF of AD patients with genetic mutations in the AD causal genes. The observed reduction of Abeta1-43 in APP and PSENs carriers highlights the pathogenic role of longer Abeta peptides in AD pathogenesis. Alterations in Abeta1-43 could prove useful in understanding the pathogenicity of unclear APP and PSENs variants, a critical step towards a more efficient genetic counselling.",

    "title": "Correction of microtubule defects within Abeta plaque-associated dystrophic axons results in lowered Abeta release and plaque deposition.",
    "abstract": "The hallmark pathologies of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain are amyloid beta (Abeta)-containing senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formed from the microtubule (MT)-binding tau protein. Tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and disengages from MTs in AD, with evidence of resulting MT structure/function defects. Brain-penetrant MT-stabilizing compounds can normalize MTs and axonal transport in mouse models with tau pathology, thereby reducing neuron loss and decreasing tau pathology. MT dysfunction is also observed in dystrophic axons adjacent to Abeta plaques, resulting in accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and BACE1 with the potential for enhanced localized Abeta generation. We have examined whether the brain-penetrant MT-stabilizing compound CNDR-51657 might decrease plaque-associated axonal dystrophy and Abeta release in 5XFAD mice that develop an abundance of Abeta plaques. Administration of CNDR-51657 to 1.5-month-old male and female 5XFAD mice for 4 or 7 weeks led to decreased soluble brain Abeta that coincided with reduced APP and BACE1 levels, resulting in decreased formation of insoluble Abeta deposits. These data suggest a vicious cycle whereby initial Abeta plaque formation causes MT disruption in nearby axons, resulting in the local accumulation of APP and BACE1 that facilitates additional Abeta generation and plaque deposition. The ability of a MT-stabilizing compound to attenuate this cycle, and also reduce deficits resulting from reduced tau binding to MTs, suggests that molecules of this type hold promise as potential AD therapeutics.",

YKL-40, a glycoprotein highly expressed in differentiated glial cells, is a candidate biomarker for in vivo tracking neuroinflammation in humans. We performed a longitudinal study in a monocentric cohort of cognitively healthy individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease exploring whether age, sex, and the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele affect plasma YKL-40 concentrations. We investigated whether YKL-40 is associated with brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition, neuronal activity, and neurodegeneration as assessed via neuroimaging biomarkers. Finally, we investigated whether YKL-40 may predict cognitive performance. We found an age-associated increase of YKL-40 and observed that men display higher concentrations than women, indicating a potential sexual dimorphism. Moreover, YKL-40 was positively associated with memory performance and negatively associated with brain Abeta deposition (but not with metabolic signal). Consistent with translational studies, our results suggest a potentially protective effect of glia on incipient brain Abeta accumulation and neuronal homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Screening to identify individuals with elevated brain amyloid (Abeta+) for clinical trials in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease (PAD), such as the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (A4) trial, is slow and costly. The Trial-Ready Cohort in Preclinical/Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease (TRC-PAD) aims to accelerate and reduce costs of AD trial recruitment by maintaining a web-based registry of potential trial participants, and using predictive algorithms to assess their likelihood of suitability for PAD trials. OBJECTIVES: Here we describe how algorithms used to predict amyloid burden within TRC-PAD project were derived using screening data from the A4 trial. DESIGN: We apply machine learning techniques to predict amyloid positivity. Demographic variables, APOE genotype, and measures of cognition and function are considered as predictors. Model data were derived from the A4 trial. SETTING: TRC-PAD data are collected from web-based and in-person assessments and are used to predict the risk of elevated amyloid and assess eligibility for AD trials. PARTICIPANTS: Pre-randomization, cross-sectional data from the ongoing A4 trial are used to develop statistical models. MEASUREMENTS: Models use a range of cognitive tests and subjective memory assessments, along with demographic variables. Amyloid positivity in A4 was confirmed using positron emission tomography (PET). RESULTS: The A4 trial screened N=4,486 participants, of which N=1323 (29%) were classified as Abeta+ (SUVR >= 1.15). The Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves for these models ranged from 0.60 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.64) for a web-based battery without APOE to 0.74 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.78) for an in-person battery. The number needed to screen to identify an Abeta+ individual is reduced from 3.39 in A4 to 2.62 in the remote setting without APOE, and 1.61 in the remote setting with APOE. CONCLUSIONS: Predictive algorithms in a web-based registry can improve the efficiency of screening in future secondary prevention trials. APOE status contributes most to predictive accuracy with cross-sectional data. Blood-based assays of amyloid will likely improve the prediction of amyloid PET positivity.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Alzheimer Prevention Trials (APT) Webstudy is the first stage in establishing a Trial-ready Cohort for Preclinical and Prodromal Alzheimer's disease (TRC-PAD). This paper describes recruitment approaches for the APT Webstudy. OBJECTIVES: To remotely enroll a cohort of individuals into a web-based longitudinal observational study. Participants are followed quarterly with brief cognitive and functional assessments, and referred to Sites for in-clinic testing and biomarker confirmation prior to enrolling in the Trial-ready Cohort (TRC). DESIGN: Participants are referred to the APT Webstudy from existing registries of individuals interested in brain health and Alzheimer's disease research, as well as through central and site recruitment efforts. The study team utilizes Urchin Tracking Modules (UTM) codes to better understand the impact of electronic recruitment methods. SETTING: A remotely enrolled online study. PARTICIPANTS: Volunteers who are at least 50 years old and interested in Alzheimer's research. MEASUREMENTS: Demographics and recruitment source of participant where measured by UTM. RESULTS: 30,650 participants consented to the APT Webstudy as of April 2020, with 69.7% resulting from referrals from online registries. Emails sent by the registry to participants were the most effective means of recruitment. Participants are distributed across the US, and the demographics of the APT Webstudy reflect the referral registries, with 73.1% female, 85.0% highly educated, and 92.5% Caucasian. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the feasibility of enrolling a remote web-based study utilizing existing registries as a primary referral source. The next priority of the study team is to engage in recruitment initiatives that will improve the diversity of the cohort, towards the goal of clinical trials that better represent the US population.",

OBJECTIVES: Describe the innovative architecture, workflows, and components of the TRC-PAD IP. DESIGN: The TRC-PAD IP was conceived as a secure, scalable, multi-tiered information management platform designed to facilitate high-throughput, cost-effective selection, recruitment, and assessment of TRC-PAD study participants and to develop a learning algorithm to select amyloid-bearing participants to participate in trials of early-stage Alzheimer's disease. SETTING: TRC-PAD participants were evaluated using both web-based and in-person assessments to predict their risk of amyloid biomarker abnormalities and eligibility for preclinical and prodromal clinical trials. Participant data were integrated across multiple stages to inform the prediction of amyloid biomarker elevation. PARTICIPANTS: TRC-PAD participants were age 50 and above, with an interest in participating in Alzheimer's research. MEASUREMENTS: TRC-PAD participants' cognitive performance and subjective memory concerns were remotely assessed on a longitudinal basis to predict participant risk of biomarker abnormalities. Those participants determined to be at the highest risk were invited to an in-clinic screening visit for a full battery of clinical and cognitive assessments and amyloid biomarker confirmation using positron emission tomography (PET) or lumbar puncture (LP). RESULTS: The TRC-PAD IP supported growth in recruitment, screening, and enrollment of TRC-PAD participants by leveraging a secure, scalable, cost-effective cloud-based information technology architecture. CONCLUSIONS: The TRC-PAD program and its underlying information management infrastructure, TRC-PAD IP, have demonstrated feasibility concerning the program aims. The flexible and modular design of the TRC-PAD IP will accommodate the introduction of emerging diagnostic technologies.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Trial-Ready Cohort for Preclinical and Prodromal Alzheimer's disease (TRC-PAD) aims to accelerate enrollment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials by remotely identifying and tracking individuals who are at high risk for developing symptoms of AD, and referring these individuals to in-person cognitive and biomarker evaluation with the purpose of engaging them in clinical trials. A risk algorithm using statistical modeling to predict brain amyloidosis will be refined as TRC-PAD advances with a maturing data set. OBJECTIVES: To provide a summary of the steps taken to build this Trial-Ready cohort (TRC) and share results of the first 3 years of enrollment into the program. DESIGN: Participants are remotely enrolled in the Alzheimer Prevention Trials (APT) Webstudy with quarterly assessments, and through an algorithm identified as potentially at high risk, referred to clinical sites for biomarker confirmation, and enrolled into the TRC. SETTING: Both an online study and in-clinic non-interventional cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: APT Webstudy participants are aged 50 or older, with an interest in participation in AD therapeutic trials. TRC participants must have a study partner, stable medical condition, and elevated brain amyloid, as measured by amyloid positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Additional risk assessments include apolipoprotein E genotyping. MEASUREMENTS: In the APT Webstudy, participants complete the Cognitive Function Index and Cogstate Brief Battery. The TRC includes the Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite, comprised of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, the Delayed Paragraph Recall score on the Logical Memory IIa test from the Wechsler Memory Scale, the Digit-Symbol Substitution test from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, and the Mini Mental State Examination total score (1). RESULTS: During the first 3 years of this program, the APT Webstudy has 30,650 consented participants, with 23 sites approved for in person screening, 112 participants have been referred for in-clinic screening visits with eighteen enrolled to the TRC. The majority of participants consented to APT Webstudy have a family history of AD (62%), identify as Caucasian (92.5%), have over twelve years of formal education (85%), and are women (73%). Follow up rates for the first quarterly assessment were 38.2% with 29.5% completing the follow up Cogstate Battery. CONCLUSIONS: After successfully designing and implementing this program, the study team's priority is to improve diversity of participants both in the APT Webstudy and TRC, to continue enrollment into the TRC to our target of 2,000, and to improve longitudinal retention, while beginning the process of referring TRC participants into clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recruitment for Alzheimer's disease (AD)-focused studies, particularly prevention studies, is challenging due to the public's lack of awareness about study opportunities coupled with studies' inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in a high screen fail rate. OBJECTIVES: To develop an internet-based participant recruitment registry for efficiently and effectively raising awareness about AD-focused study opportunities and connecting potentially eligible volunteers to studies in their communities. METHODS: Individuals age 18 and older are eligible to join the Alzheimer's Prevention Registry (APR). Individuals provide first and last name, year of birth, country, and zip/postal code to join the APR; for questions regarding race, ethnicity, sex, family history of AD or other dementia, and diagnosis of cognitive impairment, individuals have the option to select \"prefer not to answer.\" The APR website maintains a list of recruiting studies and contacts members who have opted in by email when new studies are available for enrollment. RESULTS: As of December 1, 2019, 346,661 individuals had joined the APR. Members had a mean age of 63.3 (SD 11.7) years and were predominately women (75%). 94% were cognitively unimpaired, 50% reported a family history of AD or other dementia, and of those who provided race, 76% were white. 39% joined the APR as a result of a paid social media advertisement. To date, the APR helped recruit for 82 studies. CONCLUSIONS: The APR is a large, internet-based participant recruitment registry designed to raise awareness about AD prevention research and connect members with enrolling studies in their communities. It has demonstrated the ability to recruit and engage a large number of highly motivated members and assist researchers in meeting their recruitment goals. Future publications will report on the effectiveness of APR for accelerating recruitment and enrollment into AD-focused studies.",

    "title": "An Immunomodulatory Therapeutic Vaccine Targeting Oligomeric Amyloid-beta.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aging is considered the most important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent research supports the theory that immunotherapy targeting the \"oligomeric\" forms of amyloid-beta (Abeta) may halt the progression of AD. However, previous clinical trial of the vaccine against Abeta, called AN1792, was suspended due to cases of meningoencephalitis in patients. OBJECTIVE: To develop a peptide sensitized dendritic cells (DCs) vaccine that would target oligomer Abeta and prevent an autoimmune response. METHODS: Double transgenic APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 (Tg) and C57BL/6J control mice were used in this study. Cytokine expression profile detection, characterization of antisera, brain GSK-3beta, LC3 expression, and spatial working memory testing before and post-vaccination were obtained. RESULTS: Epitope prediction indicated that E22W42 could generate 13 new T cell epitopes which can strengthen immunity in aged subjects and silence several T cell epitopes of the wild type Abeta. The silenced T cell epitope could help avoid the autoimmune response that was seen in some patients of the AN-1792 vaccine. The E22W42 not only helped sensitize bone marrow-derived DCs for the development of an oligomeric Abeta-specific antibody, but also delayed memory impairment in the APP/PS1 mouse model. Most importantly, this E22W42 peptide will not alter the DC's natural immunomodulatory properties. CONCLUSION: The E22W42 vaccine is possibly safer for patients with impaired immune systems. Since there is increasing evidence that oligomeric form of Abeta are the toxic species to neurons, the E22W42 antibody's specificity for these \"oligomeric\" Abeta species could provide the opportunity to produce some clinical benefits in AD subjects.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alterations in the methionine cycle and abnormal tau phosphorylation are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. rTg4510 mice express mutant human P301L tau and are a model of tau hyperphosphorylation. The cognitive deficit seen in these animals correlates with a burden of hyperphosphorylated tau and is a model to test therapies aimed at lowering phosphorylated tau. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to increase protein phosphatase 2A activity through supplementation of S-adenosylmethionine and analyze the effect on spatial memory and tau in treated animals. METHODS: 6-month-old rTg4510 mice were treated with 100 mg/kg S-adenosylmethionine by oral gavage for 3 weeks. Spatial recognition memory was tested in the Y-maze. Alterations to phosphorylated tau and protein phosphatase 2A were explored using immunohistochemistry, western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS: Treatment with S-adenosylmethionine increased the Y-maze novel arm exploration time and increased both the expression and activity of protein phosphatase 2A. Furthermore, treatment reduced the number of AT8 positive neurons and reduced the expression of phosphorylated tau (Ser202/Thr205). S-adenosylmethionine contributes to multiple pathways in neuronal homeostasis and neurodegeneration. CONCLUSION: This study shows that supplementation with S-adenosylmethionine stabilizes the heterotrimeric form of PP2A resulting in an increase the enzymatic activity, a reduced level of pathological tau, and improved cognition.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposits, which come in myriad morphologies with varying clinical relevance. Previously, we observed an atypical Abeta deposit, referred to as the coarse-grained plaque. In this study, we evaluate the plaque's association with clinical disease and perform in-depth immunohistochemical and morphological characterization. The coarse-grained plaque, a relatively large (O   80 microm) deposit, characterized as having multiple cores and Abeta-devoid pores, was prominent in the neocortex. The plaque was semi-quantitatively scored in the middle frontal gyrus of Abeta-positive cases (n = 74), including non-demented cases (n = 15), early-onset (EO)AD (n = 38), and late-onset (LO)AD cases (n = 21). The coarse-grained plaque was only observed in cases with clinical dementia and more frequently present in EOAD compared to LOAD. This plaque was associated with a homozygous APOE epsilon4 status and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). In-depth characterization was done by studying the coarse-grained plaque's neuritic component (pTau, APP, PrPC), Abeta isoform composition (Abeta40, Abeta42, AbetaN3pE, pSer8Abeta), its neuroinflammatory component (C4b, CD68, MHC-II, GFAP), and its vascular attribution (laminin, collagen IV, norrin). The plaque was compared to the classic cored plaque, cotton wool plaque, and CAA. Similar to CAA but different from classic cored plaques, the coarse-grained plaque was predominantly composed of Abeta40. Furthermore, the coarse-grained plaque was distinctly associated with both intense neuroinflammation and vascular (capillary) pathology. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and 3D analysis revealed for most coarse-grained plaques a particular Abeta40 shell structure and a direct relation with vessels. Based on its morphological and biochemical characteristics, we conclude that the coarse-grained plaque is a divergent Abeta plaque-type associated with EOAD. Differences in Abeta processing and aggregation, neuroinflammatory response, and vascular clearance may presumably underlie the difference between coarse-grained plaques and other Abeta deposits. Disentangling specific Abeta deposits between AD subgroups may be important in the search for disease-mechanistic-based therapies.",

    "abstract": "Protein misfolding and aggregation are hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, the accumulation and aggregation of tau and the amyloid-beta peptide Abeta1-42 precedes the onset of AD symptoms. Modelling the aggregation of Abeta is technically very challenging in vivo due to its size of only 42 aa. Here, we employed sub-stoichiometric labelling of Abeta1-42 in C. elegans to enable tracking of the peptide in vivo, combined with the \"native\" aggregation of unlabeled Abeta1-42. Expression of Abeta1-42 leads to severe physiological defects, neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Moreover, we can demonstrate spreading of neuronal Abeta to other tissues. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy enabled a quantification of the formation of amyloid fibrils with ageing and revealed a heterogenic yet specific pattern of aggregation. Notably, we found that Abeta aggregation starts in a subset of neurons of the anterior head ganglion, the six IL2 neurons. We further demonstrate that cell-specific, RNAi-mediated depletion of Abeta in these IL2 neurons systemically delays Abeta aggregation and pathology.",

    "title": "The complex relationship between genotype, pathology and phenotype in familial dementia.",
    "abstract": "Causative genes involved in familial forms of dementias, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and prion diseases where dementia is present as a significant clinical feature, are associated with distinct proteinopathies. This review summarizes the relationship between known genetic determinants of these dementia syndromes and variations in key neuropathological proteins in terms of three types of heterogeneity: (i) Locus Heterogeneity, whereby mutations in different genes cause a similar proteinopathy, as exemplified by mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 leading to AD neuropathology; (ii) Allelic Heterogeneity, whereby different mutations in the same gene lead to different proteinopathies or neuropathological severity, as exemplified by different mutations in MAPT and PRNP giving rise to protein species that differ in their biochemistry and affected cell types; and (iii) Phenotypic Heterogeneity, where identical gene mutations lead to different proteinopathies, as exemplified by LRRK2 p.G2019S being associated with variable Lewy body presence and alternative AD neuropathology or FTLD-tau. Of note, the perceived homogeneity in histologic phenotypes may arise from laboratory-specific assessment protocols which can differ in the panel of proteins screened. Finally, the understanding of the complex relationship between genotype and phenotype in dementia families is highly relevant in terms of therapeutic strategies which range from targeting specific genes, to a broader strategy of targeting a downstream, common biochemical problem that leads to the histopathology.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementia worldwide. According to the amyloid hypothesis, the early accumulation of the Abeta-peptide triggers tau phosphorylation, synaptic dysfunction, and eventually neuronal death leading to cognitive impairment, as well as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. ScFv-h3D6 is a single-chain variable fragment that has already shown its ability to diminish the amyloid burden in 5-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. However, tau pathology is not evident at this early stage of the disease in this mouse model. In this study, the effects of scFv-h3D6 on Abeta and tau pathologies have been assessed in 22-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. Briefly, 3xTg-AD female mice were treated for 2 weeks with scFv-h3D6 and compared with 3xTg-AD and non-transgenic (NTg) mice treated with PBS. The treatment with scFv-h3D6 was unequivocally effective in reducing the area of Abeta staining. Furthermore, a tendency for a reduction in tau levels was also observed after treatment that points to the interplay between Abeta and tau pathologies. The pro-inflammatory state observed in the 3xTg-AD mice did not progress after scFv-h3D6 treatment. In addition, the treatment did not alter the levels of apolipoprotein E or apolipoprotein J. Thus, a 2-week treatment with scFv-h3D6 was able to reduce AD-like pathology in elderly 3xTg-AD female mice.",

    "title": "tPA Deficiency Underlies Neurovascular Coupling Dysfunction by Amyloid-beta.",
    "abstract": "The amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, a key pathogenic factor in Alzheimer's disease, attenuates the increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) evoked by neural activity (functional hyperemia), a vital homeostatic response in which NMDA receptors (NMDARs) play a role through nitric oxide, and the CBF increase produced by endothelial factors. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which is reduced in Alzheimer's disease and in mouse models of Abeta accumulation, is required for the full expression of the NMDAR-dependent component of functional hyperemia. Therefore, we investigated whether tPA is involved in the neurovascular dysfunction of Abeta. tPA activity was reduced, and the tPA inhibitor plasminogen inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was increased in male mice expressing the Swedish mutation of the amyloid precursor protein (tg2576). Counteracting the tPA reduction with exogenous tPA or with pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of PAI-1 completely reversed the attenuation of the CBF increase evoked by whisker stimulation but did not ameliorate the response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine. The tPA deficit attenuated functional hyperemia by suppressing NMDAR-dependent nitric oxide production during neural activity. Pharmacological inhibition of PAI-1 increased tPA activity, prevented neurovascular uncoupling, and ameliorated cognition in 11- to 12-month-old tg2576 mice, effects associated with a reduction of cerebral amyloid angiopathy but not amyloid plaques. The data unveil a selective role of the tPA in the suppression of functional hyperemia induced by Abeta and in the mechanisms of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and support the possibility that modulation of the PAI-1-tPA pathway may be beneficial in diseases associated with amyloid accumulation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides have profound neurovascular effects that may contribute to cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. We found that Abeta attenuates the increases in blood flow evoked by neural activation through a reduction in tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) caused by upregulation of its endogenous inhibitor plasminogen inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). tPA deficiency prevents NMDA receptors from triggering nitric oxide production, thereby attenuating the flow increase evoked by neural activity. PAI-1 inhibition restores tPA activity, rescues neurovascular coupling, reduces amyloid deposition around blood vessels, and improves cognition in a mouse model of Abeta accumulation. The findings demonstrate a previously unappreciated role of tPA in Abeta-related neurovascular dysfunction and in vascular amyloid deposition. Restoration of tPA activity could be of therapeutic value in diseases associated with amyloid accumulation.",

    "abstract": "Nonfibrillar beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers are considered as major neurotoxic species in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. The presence of Abeta oligomers was shown to cause membrane disruptions in a broad range of model systems. However, the molecular basis of such a disruption process remains unknown. We previously demonstrated that membrane-incorporated 40-residue Abeta (Abeta40) oligomers could form coaggregates with phospholipids. This process occurred more rapidly than the fibrillization of Abeta40 and led to more severe membrane disruption. The present study probes the time-dependent changes in lipid dynamics, bilayer structures, and peptide-lipid interactions along the time course of the oligomer-induced membrane disruption, using solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Our results suggest the presence of certain intermediate states with phospholipid molecules entering the C-terminal hydrogen-bonding networks of the Abeta40 oligomeric cores. This work provides insights on the molecular mechanisms of Abeta40-oligomer-induced membrane disruption.",

    "abstract": "Variations in many genes linked to sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) show abundant expression in microglia, but relationships among these genes remain largely elusive. Here, we establish isogenic human ESC-derived microglia-like cell lines (hMGLs) harboring AD variants in CD33, INPP5D, SORL1, and TREM2 loci and curate a comprehensive atlas comprising ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and proteomics datasets. AD-like expression signatures are observed in AD mutant SORL1 and TREM2 hMGLs, while integrative multi-omic analysis of combined epigenetic and expression datasets indicates up-regulation of APOE as a convergent pathogenic node. We also observe cross-regulatory relationships between SORL1 and TREM2, in which SORL1R744X hMGLs induce TREM2 expression to enhance APOE expression. AD-associated SORL1 and TREM2 mutations also impaired hMGL Abeta uptake in an APOE-dependent manner in vitro and attenuated Abeta uptake/clearance in mouse AD brain xenotransplants. Using this modeling and analysis platform for human microglia, we provide new insight into epistatic interactions in AD genes and demonstrate convergence of microglial AD genes at the APOE locus.",

    "abstract": "Proteinopathies are key elements in the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the nature and location of the proteinopathy characterizing much of the disease phenotype. Susceptibility of brain regions to pathology may partly be determined by intrinsic network structure and connectivity. It remains unknown, however, how these networks inform the disease cascade in the context of AD biomarkers, such as beta-amyloid (Abeta), in clinically-normal older adults.The default-mode network (DMN), a prominent intrinsic network, is heavily implicated in AD due to its spatial overlap with AD atrophy patterns and tau deposition. We investigated the influence of baseline Abeta positron emission tomography (PET) signal and intrinsic DMN connectivity on DMN-specific cortical thinning in 120 clinically-normal older adults from the Harvard Aging Brain Study (73 +- 6 years, 58% Female, CDR = 0). Participants underwent11C Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) PET, 18F flortaucipir (FTP) PET, and resting-state MRI scans at baselineand longitudinal MRI (3.6 +- 0.96 scans; 5.04 +- 0.8 years). Linear mixed models tested relationships between baseline PiB and DMN connectivity on cortical thinning in a composite of DMN regions. Lower DMN connectivity was associated with faster cortical thinning, but only in those with elevated baseline PiB-PET signal. This relationship was network specific, in that the frontoparietal control network did not account for the observed association. Additionally, the relationship was independent of inferior temporal lobe FTP-PET signal. Our findings provide evidence that compromised DMN connectivity, in the context of preclinical AD, foreshadows neurodegeneration in DMN regions.",

Compared with the general population, traditional vascular risks in adults with DS are rare, allowing examination of cerebrovascular disease in this population and insight into its role in AD without the confound of vascular risk factors. We examined in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based biomarkers of cerebrovascular pathology in adults with DS, and determined their cross-sectional relationship with age, beta-amyloid pathology, and mild cognitive impairment or clinical AD diagnostic status. METHODS: Participants from the Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Down Syndrome study (n = 138, 50 +- 7 years, 39% women) with MRI data and a subset (n = 90) with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) were included. We derived MRI-based biomarkers of cerebrovascular pathology, including white matter hyperintensities (WMH), infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, and enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), as well as PET-based biomarkers of amyloid burden. Participants were characterized as cognitively stable (CS), mild cognitive impairment-DS (MCI-DS), possible AD dementia, or definite AD dementia based on in-depth assessments of cognition, function, and health status. RESULTS: There were detectable WMH, enlarged PVS, infarcts, and microbleeds as early as the 5th decade of life. There was a monotonic increase in WMH volume, enlarged PVS, and presence of infarcts across diagnostic groups (CS < MCI-DS < possible AD dementia < definite AD dementia). Higher amyloid burden was associated with a higher likelihood of an infarct. INTERPRETATION: The findings highlight the prevalence of cerebrovascular disease in adults with DS and add to a growing body of evidence that implicates cerebrovascular disease as a core feature of AD and not simply a comorbidity.

    "title": "Potential human transmission of amyloid beta pathology: surveillance and risks.",
    "abstract": "Studies in experimental animals show transmissibility of amyloidogenic proteins associated with prion diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Although these data raise potential concerns for public health, convincing evidence for human iatrogenic transmission only exists for prions and amyloid beta after systemic injections of contaminated growth hormone extracts or dura mater grafts derived from cadavers. Even though these procedures are now obsolete, some reports raise the possibility of iatrogenic transmission of amyloid beta through putatively contaminated neurosurgical equipment. Iatrogenic transmission of amyloid beta might lead to amyloid deposition in the brain parenchyma and blood vessel walls, potentially resulting in cerebral amyloid angiopathy after several decades. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy can cause life-threatening brain haemorrhages; yet, there is no proof that the transmission of amyloid beta can also lead to Alzheimer's dementia. Large, long-term epidemiological studies and sensitive, cost-efficient tools to detect amyloid are needed to better understand any potential routes of amyloid beta transmission and to clarify whether other similar proteopathic seeds, such as tau or alpha-synuclein, can also be transferred iatrogenically.",

    "title": "Age, Sex Hormones, and Circadian Rhythm Regulate the Expression of Amyloid-Beta Scavengers at the Choroid Plexus.",
    "abstract": "Accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) in the brain is thought to derive from the impairment of Abeta clearance mechanisms rather than from its overproduction, which consequently contributes to the development of Alzheimer's disease. The choroid plexus epithelial cells constitute an important clearance route for Abeta, either by facilitating its transport from the cerebrospinal fluid to the blood, or by synthesizing and secreting various proteins involved in Abeta degradation. Impaired choroid plexus synthesis, secretion, and transport of these Abeta-metabolizing enzymes have been therefore associated with the disruption of Abeta homeostasis and amyloid load. Factors such as aging, female gender, and circadian rhythm disturbances are related to the decline of choroid plexus functions that may be involved in the modulation of Abeta-clearance mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the impact of age, sex hormones, and circadian rhythm on the expression of Abeta scavengers such as apolipoprotein J, gelsolin, and transthyretin at the rat choroid plexus. Our results demonstrated that mRNA expression and both intracellular and secreted protein levels of the studied Abeta scavengers are age-, sex-, and circadian-dependent. These data suggest that the Abeta-degradation and clearance pathways at the choroid plexus, mediated by the presence of Abeta scavengers, might be compromised as a consequence of aging and circadian disturbances. These are important findings that enhance the understanding of Abeta-clearance-regulating mechanisms at the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier.",

    "abstract": "Easily accessible biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and related neurodegenerative disorders are urgently needed in an aging society to assist early-stage diagnoses. In this study, we aimed to develop machine learning algorithms using the multiplex blood-based biomarkers to identify patients with different neurodegenerative diseases. Plasma samples (n = 377) were obtained from healthy controls, patients with AD spectrum (including mild cognitive impairment (MCI)), PD spectrum with variable cognitive severity (including PD with dementia (PDD)), and FTD. We measured plasma levels of amyloid-beta 42 (Abeta42), Abeta40, total Tau, p-Tau181, and alpha-synuclein using an immunomagnetic reduction-based immunoassay. We observed increased levels of all biomarkers except Abeta40 in the AD group when compared to the MCI and controls. The plasma alpha-synuclein levels increased in PDD when compared to PD with normal cognition. We applied machine learning-based frameworks, including a linear discriminant analysis (LDA), for feature extraction and several classifiers, using features from these blood-based biomarkers to classify these neurodegenerative disorders. We found that the random forest (RF) was the best classifier to separate different dementia syndromes. Using RF, the established LDA model had an average accuracy of 76% when classifying AD, PD spectrum, and FTD. Moreover, we found 83% and 63% accuracies when differentiating the individual disease severity of subgroups in the AD and PD spectrum, respectively. The developed LDA model with the RF classifier can assist clinicians in distinguishing variable neurodegenerative disorders.",

There is increasing evidence to support its clinical utility, with major studies showing that amyloid PET imaging improves diagnostic accuracy, increases diagnostic certainty and results in therapeutic changes. The Amyloid Imaging Taskforce has developed appropriate use criteria to guide clinicians by predefining certain scenarios where amyloid PET would be justified. This review provides a practical guide on how and when to use amyloid PET, based on the available research and our own experience. We discuss its three main appropriate indications and illustrate these with clinical cases. We stress the importance of a multidisciplinary approach when deciding who might benefit from amyloid PET imaging. Finally, we highlight some practical points and common pitfalls in its interpretation.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether tau phosphorylated at Thr217 (p-tau T217) assay in CSF can distinguish patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) from patients with other dementias and healthy controls. METHODS: We developed and validated a novel Simoa immunoassay to detect p-tau T217 in CSF. There was a total of 190 participants from 3 cohorts with AD (n = 77) and other neurodegenerative diseases (n = 69) as well as healthy participants (n = 44). RESULTS: The p-tau T217 assay (cutoff 242 pg/mL) identified patients with AD with accuracy of 90%, with 78% positive predictive value (PPV), 97% negative predictive value (NPV), 93% sensitivity, and 88% specificity, compared favorably with p-tau T181 ELISA (52 pg/mL), showing 78% accuracy, 58% PPV, 98% NPV, 71% specificity, and 97% sensitivity. The assay distinguished patients with AD from age-matched healthy controls (cutoff 163 pg/mL, 98% sensitivity, 93% specificity), similarly to p-tau T181 ELISA (cutoff 60 pg/mL, 96% sensitivity, 86% specificity). In patients with AD, we found a strong correlation between p-tau T217 and p-tau T181, total tau and beta-amyloid 40, but not beta-amyloid 42. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that p-tau T217 displayed better diagnostic accuracy than p-tau T181. The data suggest that the new p-tau T217 assay has potential as an AD diagnostic test in clinical evaluation. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that a CSF immunoassay for p-tau T217 distinguishes patients with AD from patients with other dementias and healthy controls.",

Here we report an unbiased multiplex quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis using tandem mass tag (TMT) isobaric labeling of human post-mortem cortex (n = 27) across pathology-free controls, AsymAD and symptomatic AD individuals. With off-line high-pH fractionation and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on an Orbitrap Lumos mass spectrometer, we identified 11,378 protein groups across three TMT 11-plex batches. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) was used to enrich for phosphopeptides from the same TMT-labeled cases and 51,736 phosphopeptides were identified. Of these, 48,992 were quantified by TMT reporter ions representing 33,652 unique phosphosites. Two reference standards in each TMT 11-plex were included to assess intra- and inter-batch variance at the protein and peptide level.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The recent developed PET ligands for amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau allow these two neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to be mapped and quantified in vivo and to be examined in relation to cognition. OBJECTIVE: To assess the associations among Abeta, tau, and cognition in non-demented subjects. METHODS: Three hundred eighty-nine elderly participants without dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative underwent tau and amyloid PET scans. Cross-sectional comparisons and longitudinal analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between Abeta and tau accumulation. The correlations between biomarkers of both pathologies and performance in memory and executive function were measured. RESULTS: Increased amyloid-PET retention was associated with greater tau-PET retention in widespread cortices. We observed a significant tau increase in the temporal composite regions of interest over 24 months in Abeta+ but not Abeta- subjects. Finally, tau-PET retention but not amyloid-PET retention significantly explained the variance in memory and executive function. Higher level of tau was associated with greater longitudinal memory decline. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested PET-detectable Abeta plaque pathology may be a necessary antecedent for tau-PET signal elevation. Greater tau-PET retention may demonstrate poorer cognition and predict prospective memory decline in non-demented subjects.",

    "title": "Relationship Between PET-Assessed Amyloid Burden and Visual and Verbal Episodic Memory Performance in Elderly Subjects.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies of elderly subjects using biomarkers that are proxies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology have the potential to document meaningful relationships between cognitive performance and biomarker changes along the AD continuum. OBJECTIVE: To document cognitive performance differences across distinct AD stages using a categorization based on the presence of PET-assessed amyloid-beta (Abeta) burden and neurodegeneration. METHODS: Patients with mild dementia compatible with AD (n = 38) or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI; n = 43) and a cognitively unimpaired group (n = 27) underwent PET with Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) assessing Abeta aggregation (A+) and [18F]FDG-PET assessing neurodegeneration ((N)+). Cognitive performance was assessed with verbal and visual episodic memory tests and the Mini-Mental State Examination. RESULTS: The A+(N)+ subgroup (n = 32) showed decreased (p < 0.001) cognitive test scores compared to both A+(N)-(n = 18) and A-(N)-(n = 49) subjects, who presented highly similar mean cognitive scores. Despite its modest size (n = 9), the A-(N)+ subgroup showed lower (p < 0.043) verbal memory scores relative to A-(N)-subjects, and trend lower (p = 0.096) scores relative to A+(N)-subjects. Continuous Abeta measures (standard uptake value ratios of PiB uptake) were correlated most significantly with visual memory scores both in the overall sample and when analyses were restricted to dementia or (N)+ subjects, but not in non-dementia or (N)-groups. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that significant Abeta-cognition relationships are highly salient at disease stages involving neurodegeneration. The fact that findings relating Abeta burden to memory performance were detected only at (N)+ stages, together with the similarity of test scores between A+(N)-and A-(N)-subjects, reinforce the view that Abeta-cognition relationships during early AD stages may remain undetectable unless substantially large samples are evaluated.",

Oligomerization and fibrillization of amyloid beta (1-42) peptide are mainly responsible for the extra-neuronal deposition of amyloid fibrils in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we report an effect of tert-BuOH-functional imidazolium ILs on oligomerization and fibrillization of amyloid beta (1-42) Peptide in vitro. In this study, a series of these [alkyl-tOHim][OMs] ILs with methyl sulphonate counter anion by varying alkyl chains were used. Among the seven protic ILs, four showed strong binding and inhibition activity for the formation of amyloid beta (1-42) aggregation by using Thioflavin T fluorescence binding assay. The secondary structural analysis of the peptide, pre-incubated with active ILs shows the loss of ordered beta-sheet amyloid structure. The longer alkyl chain ILs showed that an increased in amyloid binding and hence an inhibition effect on amyloid aggregation was enhanced. Thus, we propose that ILs could be presented as potential candidates for therapeutic intervention against Alzheimer's disease (AD).",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) might facilitate identification of participants for clinical trials targeting amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulation, and aid in AD diagnostics. We examined the potential of plasma markers Abeta(1-42/1-40), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light (NfL) to identify cerebral amyloidosis and/or disease severity. METHODS: We included individuals with a positive (n = 176: 63 +- 7 years, 87 (49%) females) or negative (n = 76: 61 +- 9 years, 27 (36%) females) amyloid PET status, with syndrome diagnosis subjective cognitive decline (18 PET+, 25 PET-), mild cognitive impairment (26 PET+, 24 PET-), or AD-dementia (132 PET+). Plasma Abeta(1-42/1-40), GFAP, and NfL were measured by Simoa. We applied two-way ANOVA adjusted for age and sex to investigate the associations of the plasma markers with amyloid PET status and syndrome diagnosis; logistic regression analysis with Wald's backward selection to identify an optimal panel that identifies amyloid PET positivity; age, sex, and education-adjusted linear regression analysis to investigate associations between the plasma markers and neuropsychological test performance; and Spearman's correlation analysis to investigate associations between the plasma markers and medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA). RESULTS: Abeta(1-42/1-40) and GFAP independently associated with amyloid PET status (p = 0.009 and p < 0.001 respectively), and GFAP and NfL independently associated with syndrome diagnosis (p = 0.001 and p = 0.048 respectively). The optimal panel identifying a positive amyloid status included Abeta(1-42/1-40) and GFAP, alongside age and APOE (AUC = 88% (95% CI 83-93%), 82% sensitivity, 86% specificity), while excluding NfL and sex. GFAP and NfL robustly associated with cognitive performance on global cognition and all major cognitive domains (GFAP: range standardized beta (sbeta) = - 0.40 to - 0.26; NfL: range sbeta = - 0.35 to - 0.18; all: p < 0.002), whereas Abeta(1-42/1-40) associated with global cognition, memory, attention, and executive functioning (range sbeta = 0.22 - 0.11; all: p < 0.05) but not language. GFAP and NfL showed moderate positive correlations with MTA (both: Spearman's rho> 0.33, p < 0.001). Abeta(1-42/1-40) showed a moderate negative correlation with MTA (Spearman's rho = - 0.24, p = 0.001). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Combination of plasma Abeta(1-42/1-40) and GFAP provides a valuable tool for the identification of amyloid PET status. Furthermore, plasma GFAP and NfL associate with various disease severity measures suggesting potential for disease monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia but has no effective treatment. A comprehensive investigation of cell type-specific responses and cellular heterogeneity in AD is required to provide precise molecular and cellular targets for therapeutic development. Accordingly, we perform single-nucleus transcriptome analysis of 169,496 nuclei from the prefrontal cortical samples of AD patients and normal control (NC) subjects. Differential analysis shows that the cell type-specific transcriptomic changes in AD are associated with the disruption of biological processes including angiogenesis, immune activation, synaptic signaling, and myelination. Subcluster analysis reveals that compared to NC brains, AD brains contain fewer neuroprotective astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Importantly, our findings show that a subpopulation of angiogenic endothelial cells is induced in the brain in patients with AD. These angiogenic endothelial cells exhibit increased expression of angiogenic growth factors and their receptors (i.e., EGFL7, FLT1, and VWF) and antigen-presentation machinery (i.e., B2M and HLA-E). This suggests that these endothelial cells contribute to angiogenesis and immune response in AD pathogenesis. Thus, our comprehensive molecular profiling of brain samples from patients with AD reveals previously unknown molecular changes as well as cellular targets that potentially underlie the functional dysregulation of endothelial cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in AD, providing important insights for therapeutic development.",

Failures of clinical trials investigating Abeta-targeted therapies have been interpreted as evidence against this hypothesis, irrespective of the characteristics and mechanisms of action of the therapeutic agents, which are highly challenging to assess. Here, we combine kinetic analyses with quantitative binding measurements to address the mechanism of action of four clinical stage anti-Abeta antibodies, aducanumab, gantenerumab, bapineuzumab and solanezumab. We quantify the influence of these antibodies on the aggregation kinetics and on the production of oligomeric aggregates and link these effects to the affinity and stoichiometry of each antibody for monomeric and fibrillar forms of Abeta. Our results reveal that, uniquely among these four antibodies, aducanumab dramatically reduces the flux of Abeta oligomers.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several studies have investigated the value of alpha-synuclein assay in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients in the differential diagnosis of these two pathologies. However, very few studies have focused on this assay in AD and DLB patients at the MCI stage. METHODS: All patients were enrolled under a hospital clinical research protocol from the tertiary Memory Clinic (CM2R) of Alsace, France, by an experienced team of clinicians. A total of 166 patients were included in this study: 21 control subjects (CS), 51 patients with DLB at the prodromal stage (pro-DLB), 16 patients with DLB at the demented stage (DLB-d), 33 AD patients at the prodromal stage (pro-AD), 32 AD patients at the demented stage (AD-d), and 13 patients with mixed pathology (AD+DLB). CSF levels of total alpha-synuclein were assessed using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for alpha-synuclein (AJ Roboscreen). Alzheimer's biomarkers (t-Tau, P-Tau, Abeta42, and Abeta40) were also measured. RESULTS: The alpha-synuclein assays showed a significant difference between the AD and DLB groups. Total alpha-synuclein levels were significantly higher in AD patients than in DLB patients. However, the ROC curves show a moderate discriminating power between AD and DLB (AUC = 0.78) which does not improve the discriminating power of the combination of Alzheimer biomarkers (AUC = 0.95 with or without alpha-synuclein). Interestingly, the levels appeared to be altered from the prodromal stage in both AD and DLB. CONCLUSIONS: The modification of total alpha-synuclein levels in the CSF of patients occurs early, from the prodromal stage. The adding of alpha-synuclein total to the combination of Alzheimer's biomarker does not improve the differential diagnosis between AD and DLB.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Finding a pharmacological approach that cures and/or prevents the onset of this devastating disease represents an important challenge for researchers. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, increases in extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels give rise to different aggregated species, such as protofibrils, fibrils and oligomers, with oligomers being the more toxic species for cells. Many efforts have recently been focused on multi-target ligands to address the multiple events that occur concurrently with toxic aggregation at the onset of the disease. Moreover, investigating the effect of endogenous compounds or a combination thereof is a promising approach to prevent the side effects of entirely synthetic drugs. In this work, we report the synthesis, structural characterization and Abeta antiaggregant ability of new derivatives of hyaluronic acid (Hy, 200 and 700 kDa) functionalized with carnosine (Car), a multi-functional natural dipeptide. The bioactive substances (HyCar) inhibit the formation of amyloid-type aggregates of Abeta42 more than the parent compounds; this effect is proportional to Car loading. Furthermore, the HyCar derivatives are able to dissolve the amyloid fibrils and to reduce Abeta-induced toxicity in vitro. The enzymatic degradation of Abeta is also affected by the interaction with HyCar.",

However, it is unclear whether snRNA-seq is able to detect cellular state in human tissue. Indeed, snRNA-seq analyses of human brain samples have failed to detect a consistent microglial activation signature in Alzheimer's disease. Our comparison of microglia from single cells and single nuclei of four human subjects reveals that, although most genes show similar relative abundances in cells and nuclei, a small population of genes (~1%) is depleted in nuclei compared to whole cells. This population is enriched for genes previously implicated in microglial activation, including APOE, CST3, SPP1, and CD74, comprising 18% of previously identified microglial-disease-associated genes. Given the low sensitivity of snRNA-seq to detect many activation genes, we conclude that snRNA-seq is not suited for detecting cellular activation in microglia in human disease.",

    "abstract": "Recent genome-wide association studies identified the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene (ACE) as an Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk locus. However, the pathogenic mechanism by which ACE causes AD is unknown. Using whole-genome sequencing, we identified rare ACE coding variants in AD families and investigated one, ACE1 R1279Q, in knockin (KI) mice. Similar to AD, ACE1 was increased in neurons, but not microglia or astrocytes, of KI brains, which became elevated further with age. Angiotensin II (angII) and angII receptor AT1R signaling were also increased in KI brains. Autosomal dominant neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation occurred with aging in KI hippocampus, which were absent in the cortex and cerebellum. Female KI mice exhibited greater hippocampal electroencephalograph disruption and memory impairment compared to males. ACE variant effects were more pronounced in female KI mice, suggesting a mechanism for higher AD risk in women. Hippocampal neurodegeneration was completely rescued by treatment with brain-penetrant drugs that inhibit ACE1 and AT1R. Although ACE variant-induced neurodegeneration did not depend on beta-amyloid (Abeta) pathology, amyloidosis in 5XFAD mice crossed to KI mice accelerated neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, whereas Abeta deposition was unchanged. KI mice had normal blood pressure and cerebrovascular functions. Our findings strongly suggest that increased ACE1/angII signaling causes aging-dependent, Abeta-accelerated selective hippocampal neuron vulnerability and female susceptibility, hallmarks of AD that have hitherto been enigmatic. We conclude that repurposed brain-penetrant ACE inhibitors and AT1R blockers may protect against AD.",

    "abstract": "Drainage of parenchymal waste through the lymphatic system maintains brain homeostasis. Age-related changes of glymphatic-lymphatic clearance lead to the accumulation beta-amyloid (Abeta) in dementia models. In this study, focused ultrasound treatment in combination with microbubbles (FUS-MB) improved Abeta drainage in early dementia model mice, 5XFAD. FUS-MB enhanced solute Abeta clearance from brain, but not plaques, to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) space and then deep cervical lymph node (dCLN). dCLN ligation exaggerated memory impairment and progress of plaque formation and also the beneficial effects of FUS-MB upon Abeta removal through CSF-lymphatic routes. In this ligation model, FUS-MB improved memory despite accumulation of Abeta in CSF. In conclusion, FUS-MB enhances glymphatic-lymphatic clearance of Abeta mainly by increasing brain-to-CSF Abeta drainage. We suggest that FUS-MB can delay dementia progress in early period and benefits of FUS-MB depend on the effect of Abeta disposal through CSF-lymphatics.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies in animal models demonstrate that certain misfolded proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases can support templated misfolding of cognate native proteins, to propagate across neural systems, and to therefore have some of the properties of classical prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The National Institute of Aging convened a meeting to discuss the implications of these observations for research priorities. A summary of the discussion is presented here, with a focus on limitations of current knowledge, highlighting areas that appear to require further investigation in order to guide scientific practice while minimizing potential exposure or risk in the laboratory setting. The committee concluded that, based on all currently available data, although neurodegenerative disease-associated aggregates of several different non-prion proteins can be propagated from humans to experimental animals, there is currently insufficient evidence to suggest more than a negligible risk, if any, of a direct infectious etiology for the human neurodegenerative disorders defined in part by these proteins. Given the importance of this question, the potential for noninvasive human transmission of proteopathic disorders is deserving of further investigation.",

However, it is not yet known whether LTP-like plasticity is also impaired in prodromal AD, or how abnormal TMS measures are related to established AD biomarkers. Here, we investigated the LTP-like response to intermittent theta-burst stimulation in 17 amyloid-positive participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 10 cognitively unimpaired controls. Our results showed a lack of LTP-like neuromodulation in MCI compared with controls that was unrelated to quantitative amyloid-beta burden on positron emission tomography. Surprisingly, greater LTP-like response was related to worse memory function in the MCI group, highlighting the complex role of neuroplasticity in the prodromal stages of AD. Overall, our results demonstrate abnormal LTP-like plasticity using intermittent theta-burst stimulation assessment in amyloid-positive participants with MCI. These findings support the potential for development of TMS measures as prognostic markers or therapeutic targets in early-stage symptomatic AD.",

    "title": "Microglia prevent beta-amyloid plaque formation in the early stage of an Alzheimer's disease mouse model with suppression of glymphatic clearance.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) can be cleared from the brain through various mechanisms including enzymatic degradation, glial cell phagocytosis, transport across the blood-brain barrier, and glymphatic clearance. However, the relative contribution of each clearance system and their compensatory effects in delaying the pathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are currently unknown. METHODS: Fluorescent trace, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analyses were performed to compare glymphatic clearance ability and Abeta accumulation among 3-month-old APP695/PS1-dE9 transgenic (APP/PS1) mice, wild-type mice, aquaporin 4 knock out (AQP4-/-) mice, and AQP4-/-/APP/PS1 mice. The consequence of selectively eliminating microglial cells, or downregulating apolipoprotein E (apoE) expression, on Abeta burden, was also investigated in the frontal cortex of AQP4-/-/APP/PS1 mice and APP/PS1 mice. RESULTS: AQP4 deletion in APP/PS1 mice significantly exaggerated glymphatic clearance dysfunction, and intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta and apoE, although it did not lead to Abeta plaque deposition. Notably, microglia, but not astrocytes, increased activation and phagocytosis of Abeta in the cerebral cortex of AQP4-/-/APP/PS1 mice, compared with APP/PS1 mice. Selectively eliminating microglia in the frontal cortex via local injection of clodronate liposomes resulted in deposition of Abeta plaques in AQP4-/-/APP/PS1 mice, but not APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, knockdown of apoE reduced intraneuronal Abeta levels in both APP/PS1 mice and AQP4-/-/APP/PS1 mice, indicating an inhibitory effect of apoE on Abeta clearance. CONCLUSION: The above results suggest that the glymphatic system mediated Abeta and apoE clearance and microglia mediated Abeta degradation synergistically prevent Abeta plague formation in the early stages of the AD mouse model. Protecting one or both of them might be beneficial to delaying the onset of AD.",

    "title": "Cerebrospinal fluid A beta 1-40 peptides increase in Alzheimer's disease and are highly correlated with phospho-tau in control individuals.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyloid pathology, which is one of the characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD), results from altered metabolism of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in terms of synthesis, clearance, or aggregation. A decrease in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) level Abeta1-42 is evident in AD, and the CSF ratio Abeta42/Abeta40 has recently been identified as one of the most reliable diagnostic biomarkers of amyloid pathology. Variations in inter-individual levels of Abeta1-40 in the CSF have been observed in the past, but their origins remain unclear. In addition, the variation of Abeta40 in the context of AD studied in several studies has yielded conflicting results. METHODS: Here, we analyzed the levels of Abeta1-40 using multicenter data obtained on 2466 samples from six different cohorts in which CSF was collected under standardized protocols, centrifugation, and storage conditions. Tau and p-tau (181) concentrations were measured using commercially available in vitro diagnostic immunoassays. Concentrations of CSF Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 were measured by ELISA, xMAP technology, chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), and mass spectrometry. Statistical analyses were calculated for parametric and non-parametric comparisons, linear regression, correlation, and odds ratios. The statistical tests were adjusted for the effects of covariates (age, in particular). RESULTS: Regardless of the analysis method used and the cohorts, a slight but significant age-independent increase in the levels of Abeta40 in CSF was observed in AD. We also found a strong positive correlation between the levels of Abeta1-40 and p-tau (181) in CSF, particularly in control patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that an increase in the baseline level of amyloid peptides, which are associated with an increase in p-tau (181), may be a biological characteristic and possibly a risk factor for AD. Further studies will be needed to establish a causal link between increased baseline levels of Abeta40 and the development of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Misfolded and natively disordered globular proteins tend to aggregate together in an interwoven fashion to form fibrous, proteinaceous deposits referred to as amyloid fibrils. Formation and deposition of such insoluble fibrils are the characteristic features of a broad group of diseases, known as amyloidosis. Some of these proteins are known to cause several degenerative disorders in humans, such as Amyloid-Beta (Abeta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), human Islet Amyloid Polypeptide (hIAPP, amylin) in type 2 diabetes, alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in Parkinson's disease (PD) and so on. The fact that these proteins do not share any significant sequence or structural homology in their native states make therapy quite challenging. However, it is observed that aggregation-prone proteins and peptides tend to adopt a similar type of secondary structure during the formation of fibrils. Rationally designed peptides can be a potent inhibitor that has been shown to disrupt the fibril structure by binding specifically to the amyloidogenic region(s) within a protein. The following review will analyze the inhibitory potency of both sequence-based and structure-based small peptides that have been shown to inhibit amyloidogenesis of proteins such as Abeta, human amylin, and alpha-synuclein.",

Patients with mPPA were further classified as 4 nf/lvPPA (with prevailing features for nfvPPA and lvPPA) and 5 s/lvPPA (with prevailing features for svPPA and lvPPA). Nf/lvPPA patients were characterized by higher proportion of Naming impairment compared to nfvPPA and more frequent Grammatical Errors and Phonologic Errors than lvPPA. S/lvPPA had higher proportion of impairment in Sentences Repetition compared to svPPA and in Single-word Comprehension compared to lvPPA. 100% of nf/lvPPA and 40% of s/lvPPA had Abeta positive biomarkers. Brain hypometabolic pattern in Nf/lvPPA was consistent with lvPPA, while s/lvPPA had a brain metabolism resembling svPPA.

    "abstract": "beta-Amyloid (Abeta) plaques can trigger chronic inflammation in the cellular environment that recruits infiltrating macrophages during the course of Alzheimer disease (AD). Activated macrophages release pro-inflammatory cytokines that increase neurotoxicity associated with AD. A major impediment to investigating neuroinflammation involving macrophage activity is the inability to discriminate resident microglial macrophages (mMphi) from hematogenous macrophages (hMphi), as they are morphologically and phenotypically similar when activated. To distinguish between mMphi and hMphi and to determine their respective roles in chronic inflammation associated with the progression of amyloidosis, we used lys-EGFP-ki transgenic mice that express enhanced green fluorescent protein in hMphi, but not in mMphi. These mice were crossed with 5XFAD mice. The offspring demonstrated robust AD pathology and enabled visual discrimination of mMphi from hMphi. Mutant mice demonstrated robust increases in Abeta1-42, area of Abeta plaques, gliosis and deficits in spatial learning by age 5 months. The time-course of Abeta accumulation, paralleled by the accumulation of hMphi around Abeta plaques, was more robust in female compared with male mice and preceded behavioral changes. Thus, the accumulation of infiltrating hMphi around Abeta plaques was age- and sex-dependent and preceded cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the prevalent dementia in the elderly, involves many related and interdependent pathologies that manifest simultaneously, leading to cognitive impairment and death. Amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation in the brain triggers the onset of AD, accompanied by neuroinflammatory response and pathological changes. The CXCR4/CXCL12 (SDF1) axis is one of the major signal transduction cascades involved in the inflammation process and regulation of homing of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) within the bone marrow niche. Inhibition of the axis with AMD3100, a reversible antagonist of CXCR4 mobilizes endogenous HSCs from the bone marrow into the periphery, facilitating the recruitment of bone marrow-derived microglia-like cells into the brain, attenuates the neuroinflammation process that involves release of excitotoxic markers such as TNFalpha, intracellular Ca2 +, and glutamate and upregulates monocarboxylate transporter 1, the major L-lactate transporter in the brain. OBJECTIVE: Herein, we investigate if administration of a combination of AMD3100 and L-lactate may have beneficial effects in the treatment of AD. METHODS: We tested the feasibility of the combined treatment for short- and long-term efficacy for inducing endogenous stem cells' mobilization and attenuation of neuroinflammation in two distinct amyloid-beta-induced AD mouse models. RESULTS: The combined treatment did not demonstrate any adverse effects on the mice, and resulted in a significant improvement in cognitive/memory functions, attenuated neuroinflammation, and alleviated AD pathologies compared to each treatment alone. CONCLUSION: This study showed AMD3100's beneficial effect in ameliorating AD pathogenesis, suggesting an alternative to the multistep procedures of transplantation of stem cells in the treatment of AD.",

Few studies have cross-sectionally examined whether clinically-confirmed OSA is associated with a higher brain amyloid burden. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare brain amyloid burden in individuals with untreated OSA and healthy controls, and explore associations between amyloid burden and polysomnographic and subjective measures of sleep, demographics, and mood. METHODS: Thirty-four individuals with OSA (mean age 57.5+-4.1 y; 19 males) and 12 controls (mean age 58.5+-4.2 y; 6 males) underwent a clinical polysomnogram and a 11C-PiB positron emission tomography (PET) scan to quantify amyloid burden. RESULTS: Amyloid burden was elevated in the OSA group relative to controls, and was significantly higher in those with severe OSA relative to mild/moderate OSA. Correlation analyses indicated that higher amyloid burden was associated with a higher Non-REM apnea hypopnea index, poorer sleep efficiency, and less time spent in stage N3 sleep, when controlling for age. CONCLUSION: Severe OSA is associated with a modest elevation of brain amyloid, the significance of which should be further investigated to explore the implications for dementia risk.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, the molecular mechanism controlling microglial Abeta phagocytosis is poorly understood. Here we found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino 1 (Peli1) is induced in the microglia of AD-like five familial AD (5xFAD) mice, whose phagocytic efficiency for Abeta was then impaired, and therefore Peli1 depletion suppressed the Abeta deposition in the brains of 5xFAD mice. Mechanistic characterizations indicated that Peli1 directly targeted CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)beta, a major transcription factor responsible for the transcription of scavenger receptor CD36. Peli1 functioned as a direct E3 ubiquitin ligase of C/EBPbeta and mediated its ubiquitination-induced degradation. Consequently, loss of Peli1 increased the protein levels of C/EBPbeta and the expression of CD36 and thus, promoted the phagocytic ability in microglial cells. Together, our findings established Peli1 as a critical regulator of microglial phagocytosis and highlighted the therapeutic potential by targeting Peli1 for the treatment of microglia-mediated neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "Structural studies of the aggregation inhibition of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) by different natural compounds are of the utmost importance due to their great potential as neuroprotective and therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease. We provided the simulation of molecular dynamics for two different states of Abeta42, including \"monomeric aggregation-prone state (APS)\" and \"U-shaped pentamers of amyloidogenic protofilament intermediates\" in the absence and presence of polyphenolic flavonoids (Flvs, myricetin and morin) in order to verify the possible mechanism of Flvs fibrillogenesis suppression. Data showed that Flvs directly bind into Abeta42 species in both states of \"monomeric APS beta-sheets\" and \"pentameric amyloidogenic intermediates\". Binding of Flvs with amyloidogenic protofilament intermediates caused the attenuation of some inter-chains H-bonds, salt bridges, van der Waals and interpeptide interaction energies without interfering with their secondary beta-sheets. Therefore, Flvs redirect oligomeric amyloidogenic intermediates into unstructured aggregates by significant disruption of the \"steric zipper\" motif of fibrils-pairs of self-complementary beta-sheets-without changing the amount of beta-sheets. It is while Flvs completely destruct the disadvantageous secondary beta-sheets of monomeric APS conformers by converting them into coil/helix structures. It means that Flvs suppress the fibrillogenesis process of the monomeric APS structures by converting their beta-sheets into proper soluble coil/helices structures. The different actions of Flvs in contact with two different states of Abeta conformers are related to high interaction tendency of Flvs with additional H-bonds for monomeric APS beta-sheet, rather than oligomeric protofilaments. Linear interaction energy (LIE) analysis confirmed the strong binding of monomeric Abeta-Flvs with more negative  Gbinding, rather than oligomeric Abeta-Flvs system. Therefore, atomic scale computational evaluation of Flvs actions demonstrated different dual functions of Flvs, concluded from the application of two different monomeric and pentameric Abeta42 systems. The distinct dual functions of Flvs are proposed as suppressing the aggregation by converting beta-sheets of monomeric APS to proper soluble structures and disrupting the \"steric zipper\" fibril motifs of oligomeric intermediate by converting on-pathway into off-pathway. Taken together, our data propose that Flvs exert dual and more effective functions against monomeric APS (fibrillogenesis suppression) and remodel the Abeta aggregation pathway (fibril destabilization).",

We investigate the cellular consequences of APOE4 in human iPSC-derived astrocytes, observing an endocytic defect in APOE4 astrocytes compared with their isogenic APOE3 counterparts. Given the evolutionarily conserved nature of endocytosis, we built a yeast model to identify genetic modifiers of the endocytic defect associated with APOE4. In yeast, only the expression of APOE4 results in dose-dependent defects in both endocytosis and growth. We discover that increasing expression of the early endocytic adaptor protein Yap1802p, a homolog of the human AD risk factor PICALM, rescues the APOE4-induced endocytic defect. In iPSC-derived human astrocytes, increasing expression of PICALM similarly reverses endocytic disruptions. Our work identifies a functional interaction between two AD genetic risk factors-APOE4 and PICALM-centered on the conserved biological process of endocytosis.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a neurotropic flavivirus that causes several diseases including birth defects such as microcephaly. Intrinsic immunity is known to be a frontline defense against viruses through host anti-viral restriction factors. Limited knowledge is available on intrinsic immunity against ZIKV in brains. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is predominantly expressed in brains and implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's diseases. We have found that ZIKV interacts with APP, and viral infection increases APP expression via enhancing protein stability. Moreover, we identified the viral peptide, HGSQHSGMIVNDTGHETDENRAKVEITPNSPRAEATLGGFGSLGL, which is capable of en-hancing APP expression. We observed that aging brain tissues with APP had protective effects on ZIKV infection by reducing the availability of the viruses. Also, knockdown of APP expression or blocking ZIKV-APP interactions enhanced ZIKV replication in human neural progenitor/stem cells. Finally, intracranial infection of ZIKV in APP-null neonatal mice resulted in higher mortality and viral yields. Taken together, these findings suggest that APP is a restriction factor that protects against ZIKV by serving as a decoy receptor, and plays a protective role in ZIKV-mediated brain injuries.",

    "title": "Sex-related differences in the relationship between beta-amyloid and cognitive trajectories in older adults.",
    "abstract": "Objective: We aimed to test the hypothesis that elevated neocortical beta-amyloid (Abeta), a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), predicts sex-specific cognitive trajectories in clinically normal older adults, with women showing greater risk of decline than men. Method: Florbetapir Abeta positron emission tomography (PET) was acquired in 149 clinically normal older adults (52% female, Mage = 74). Participants underwent cognitive testing at baseline and during annual follow-up visits over a timespan of up to 5.14 years. Mixed-effects regression models evaluated whether relations between baseline neocortical Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) and composite scores of episodic memory, executive functioning, and processing speed were moderated by sex (male/female) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) status (epsilon4 carrier/noncarrier). Results: Higher baseline SUVR was associated with longitudinal decline in episodic memory in women (b = -1.32, p < .001) but not men (b = -0.30, p = .28). Female APOE epsilon4 carriers with elevated SUVR showed particularly precipitous declines in episodic memory (b = -4.33, p < .001) whereas other cognitive domains were spared. SUVR did not predict changes in executive functioning or processing speed, regardless of sex (ps >.63), though there was a main effect of SUVR on processing speed (b = 2.50, p = .003). Conclusions: Clinically normal women with elevated Abeta are more vulnerable to episodic memory decline than men. Understanding sex-related differences in AD, particularly in preclinical stages, is crucial for guiding precision medicine approaches to early detection and intervention.

    "title": "White matter hyperintensities across the adult lifespan: relation to age, Abeta load, and cognition.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are very frequent in older adults and associated with worse cognitive performance. Little is known about the links between WMH and vascular risk factors, cortical beta-amyloid (Abeta) load, and cognition in cognitively unimpaired adults across the entire lifespan, especially in young and middle-aged adults. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-seven cognitively unimpaired adults from the community were enrolled (IMAP cohort). Participants underwent (i) a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of episodic memory, processing speed, working memory, and executive functions; (ii) brain structural T1 and FLAIR MRI scans used for the automatic segmentation of total and regional (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, and corpus callosum) WMH; and (iii) a Florbetapir-PET scan to measure cortical Abeta. The relationships of total and regional WMH to age, vascular risk factors, cortical Abeta, and cognition were assessed within the whole sample, but also splitting the sample in two age groups (<= or > 60 years old). RESULTS: WMH increased with age across the adult lifespan, i.e., even in young and middle-aged adults. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and glycated hemoglobin were all associated with higher WMH before, but not after, adjusting for age and the other vascular risk factors. Higher frontal, temporal, and occipital WMH were associated with greater Abeta, but this association was no longer significant when adjusting for age and vascular risk factors. Higher total and frontal WMH were associated with worse performance in executive functions, with no interactive effect of the age group. In contrast, there was a significant interaction of the age group on the link between WMH and working memory, which was significant within the subgroup of young/middle-aged adults only. Adding cortical Abeta load in the models did not alter the results, and there was no interaction between WMH and Abeta on cognition. CONCLUSION: WMH increased with age and were associated with worse executive functions across the adult lifespan and with worse working memory in young/middle-aged adults. Abeta load was weakly associated with WMH and did not change the relationship found between WMH and executive functions. This study argues for the clinical relevance of WMH across the adult lifespan, even in young and middle-aged adults with low WMH.",

Although high brain amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition and neurofilament light chain (NfL) are associated with cognitive and gait speed decline, relationships of combined plasma Abeta and NfL profiles with cognitive and physical functions in older adults remain unknown. The research aim of this study was to investigate the prospective associations of combined plasma Abeta and NfL profiles with cognitive and physical functions in older adults. METHODS: Participants (n = 452, aged 76 +- 5 years) who had both plasma Abeta and NfL data collected from the Multidomain Alzheimer's Preventive Trial (MAPT, May 2008 to April 2016) were included in the current study. These participants were from four MAPT groups (multidomain interventions [physical activity and nutritional counselling, and cognitive training], omega-3 supplementation, multidomain plus omega-3 supplementation and control group) and had received a 3-year intervention, followed by a 2-year observational follow-up. Cognitive function was evaluated as Mini-Mental State Examination and composite cognitive score (CCS, a mean Z-score combining four cognitive tests). Physical function was evaluated as gait speed (4-m usual-pace walk test) and chair-stand time (5-time maximal chair-stand test). Cognitive and physical function data measured at the time of and after blood Abeta and NfL tests were used for analysis. Participants with plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios lower than 0.107 and NfL levels greater than 93.04 pg/ml were classified as Abeta+ and NfL+. Multivariable regressions and mixed-effects linear models were used for the analysis. RESULTS: At the cross-sectional level, no significant association was found between Abeta+NfL+ and cognitive or physical function after controlling for age, sex, body mass index, education level and MAPT group. Evaluating longitudinal changes, participants with Abeta+NfL+ had greater annual declines in the CCS (beta = - 0.11, 95%CI [- 0.17, - 0.05]) and gait speed (beta = - 0.03, 95%CI [- 0.05, - 0.005]). After adjusting for APOE e4 genotype, Abeta+NfL+ was associated with a greater decline only in the CCS (beta = - 0.09, 95%CI [- 0.15, - 0.02]). CONCLUSIONS: Combined low plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and high plasma NfL level was associated with greater declines in cognition and gait speed over time, providing further evidence of the links between cognitive and physical function.

    "abstract": "Excitotoxicity induced by NMDA receptors (NMDARs) is thought to be intimately linked to high intracellular calcium load. Unexpectedly, NMDAR-mediated toxicity can be eliminated without affecting NMDAR-induced calcium signals. Instead, excitotoxicity requires physical coupling of NMDARs to TRPM4. This interaction is mediated by intracellular domains located in the near-membrane portions of the receptors. Structure-based computational drug screening using the interaction interface of TRPM4 in complex with NMDARs identified small molecules that spare NMDAR-induced calcium signaling but disrupt the NMDAR/TRPM4 complex. These interaction interface inhibitors strongly reduce NMDA-triggered toxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction, abolish cyclic adenosine monophosphate-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) shutoff, boost gene induction, and reduce neuronal loss in mouse models of stroke and retinal degeneration. Recombinant or small-molecule NMDAR/TRPM4 interface inhibitors may mitigate currently untreatable human neurodegenerative diseases.",

However, no studies have examined BOLD variability in the context of preclinical AD. We tested relationships between resting-state BOLD variability and biomarkers of amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration in a large (N = 321), well-characterized sample of cognitively normal adults (age = 39-93), using multivariate machine learning techniques. Furthermore, we controlled for cardiovascular health factors, which may contaminate resting-state BOLD variability estimates. BOLD variability, particularly in the default mode network, was related to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta42 but was not related to CSF phosphorylated tau-181. Furthermore, BOLD variability estimates were also related to markers of neurodegeneration, including CSF neurofilament light protein, hippocampal volume, and a cortical thickness composite. Notably, relationships with hippocampal volume and cortical thickness survived correction for cardiovascular health and also contributed to age-related differences in BOLD variability. Thus, BOLD variability may be sensitive to preclinical pathology, including amyloidosis and neurodegeneration in AD-sensitive areas.",

The structural classification of oligomers indicates two fundamentally distinct oligomers, namely, fibrillar and prefibrillar oligomers that are recognized by OC and A11 conformation-specific antibodies, respectively. Previous studies have indicated that the interaction of Abeta oligomers with the lipid membrane is one of the mechanisms by which these oligomers exert their toxic effects in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we report that the orientational ordering of liquid crystals (LC) can be used to study the membrane-induced aggregation of Abeta oligomers at nanomolar concentrations. Our results demonstrate a faster fibrillation kinetics of OC-positive fibrillar Abeta oligomers with the lipid monolayer in comparison to that of the A11-positive prefibrillar Abeta oligomers. Our findings suggest a general strategy for distinguishing conformationally distinct soluble oligomers that are formed by a number of amyloidogenic proteins on lipid-decorated aqueous-LC interfaces.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Met carriage impacts the risk or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the interaction of BDNF Met and APOE4 carriage on cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl), amyloid burden, hippocampus volume, and cognitive decline among cognitively unimpaired (CU) adults enrolled in the Arizona APOE cohort study. METHODS: 114 CU adults (mean age 56.85 years, 38% male) with longitudinal FDG PET, magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive measures were BDNF and APOE genotyped. A subgroup of 58 individuals also had Pittsburgh B (PiB) PET imaging. We examined baseline CMRgl, PiB PET amyloid burden, CMRgl, and hippocampus volume change over time, and rate of change in cognition over an average of 15 years. RESULTS: Among APOE4 carriers, BDNF Met carriers had significantly increased amyloid deposition and accelerated CMRgl decline in regions typically affected by AD, but without accompanying acceleration of cognitive decline or hippocampal volume changes and with higher baseline frontal CMRgl and slower frontal decline relative to the Val/Val group. The BDNF effects were not found among APOE4 non-carriers. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary studies suggest that there is a weak interaction between BDNF Met and APOE4 on amyloid-beta plaque burden and longitudinal PET measurements of AD-related CMRgl decline in cognitively unimpaired late-middle-aged and older adults, but with no apparent effect upon rate of cognitive decline. We suggest that cognitive effects of BDNF variants may be mitigated by compensatory increases in frontal brain activity-findings that would need to be confirmed in larger studies.",

METHODS: APECS (verubecestat) and AMARANTH (lanabecestat) were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 104-week clinical trials conducted by different sponsors. Measures included the 3-Domain Composite Cognition Score (CCS-3D), Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), Letter/Category Fluency, and Digit Symbol Coding. RESULTS: Verubecestat showed worsening on the CCS-3D Total Score, Episodic Memory, and Attention/Processing Speed domains. Lanabecestat showed worsening on the RBANS Total Score, Immediate Memory, and Visuospatial/Constructional Indexes. Both BACE inhibitors showed worsening on Digit Symbol Coding and improvements on Letter/Category Fluency. DISCUSSION: In both studies, many measures showed treatment-associated cognitive worsening, whereas verbal fluency tasks showed improvement.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is marked by progressive cognitive decline, deposition of misfolded amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide and formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Recently, microglial training has emerged as an important contributor to neurological diseases, which augments the subsequent inflammation. However, how it affects the pathology of AD remains unknown. Here, using a mouse model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (SAD) induced by streptozotocin injection, we demonstrated that microglial training exacerbated Abeta accumulation, neuronal loss, and cognitive impairment. In addition, we injected MCC950 to inhibit NLRP3 activation and used an inducible Cre recombinase to delete the NLRP3 gene in microglia. Inhibition or depletion of microglial NLRP3 could protect against the pathologies of SAD and abolish the effects of microglial training. Our results identified microglial training as an important modifier of neuropathology in SAD and demonstrated that activation of NLRP3 inflammasome contributed to the pathologies and microglial training in SAD. Therefore, NLRP3 could be a potential therapeutic target for SAD treatment.",

In vitro aggregation kinetics have been shown to correlate with rates of disease progression in both AD patients and animal models, thus proving to be a useful metric for testing Abeta-targeted therapeutics. Here we present evidence of cobalt(III) Schiff base complex ([Co(acetylacetonate)(NH3)2]Cl; Co(III)-sb) modulation of Abeta aggregation kinetics by a variety of complementary techniques. These include Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Our data was fitted to kinetic rate laws using a mathematical model developed by Knowles et al. in order to extract mechanistic information about the effect of Co(III)-sb on aggregation kinetics. Our analysis revealed that Co(III)-sb alters Abeta aggregation by decreasing the polymerization rate and increasing the nucleation rate, suggesting that Co(III)-sb causes Abeta to rapidly stabilize oligomeric species with reduced elongation into mature fibrils. This result was corroborated by TEM and AFM of Abeta aggregates in vitro. We also demonstrate that Abeta aggregate mixtures produced in the presence of Co(III)-sb exhibit decreased cytotoxicity compared to untreated samples.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuronal loss and accumulation of beta-amyloid-protein (Abeta) in the brain parenchyma. Sleep impairment is associated with AD and affects about 25-40% of patients in the mild-to-moderate stages of the disease. Sleep deprivation leads to increased Abeta production; however, its mechanism remains largely unknown. We hypothesized that the increase in core body temperature induced by sleep deprivation may promote Abeta production. Here, we report temperature-dependent regulation of Abeta production. We found that an increase in temperature, from 37  C to 39  C, significantly increased Abeta production in amyloid precursor protein-overexpressing cells. We also found that high temperature (39  C) significantly increased the expression levels of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and the C-terminal fragment of presenilin 1 (PS1-CTF) and promoted gamma-secretase complex formation. Interestingly, Hsp90 was associated with the components of the premature gamma-secretase complex, anterior pharynx-defective-1 (APH-1), and nicastrin (NCT) but was not associated with PS1-CTF or presenilin enhancer-2. Hsp90 knockdown abolished the increased level of Abeta production and the increased formation of the gamma-secretase complex at high temperature in culture. Furthermore, with in vivo experiments, we observed increases in the levels of Hsp90, PS1-CTF, NCT, and the gamma-secretase complex in the cortex of mice housed at higher room temperature (30  C) compared with those housed at standard room temperature (23  C). Our results suggest that high temperature regulates Abeta production by modulating gamma-secretase complex formation through the binding of Hsp90 to NCT/APH-1.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The disconnection hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is supported by growing neuroimaging and neurophysiological evidence of altered brain functional connectivity in cognitively impaired individuals. Brain functional modalities such as [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography ([18F]FDG-PET) and electroencephalography (EEG) measure different aspects of synaptic functioning, and can contribute to understanding brain connectivity disruptions in AD. Aim: This study investigated the relationship between cortical glucose metabolism and topographical EEG measures of brain functional connectivity in subjects along AD continuum. Methods: Patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD (n = 67), and stratified into amyloid-positive (n = 32) and negative (n = 10) groups according to cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42/40 ratio, were assessed with [18F]FDG-PET and resting-state EEG recordings. EEG-based neuroimaging analysis involved standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA), which estimates functional connectivity from cortical sources of electrical activity in a 3D head model. Results: Glucose hypometabolism in temporoparietal lobes was significantly associated with altered EEG functional connectivity of the same regions of interest in clinically diagnosed MCI and AD patients and in patients with biomarker-verified AD pathology. The correlative pattern of disrupted connectivity in temporoparietal lobes, as detected by EEG sLORETA analysis, included decreased instantaneous linear connectivity in fast frequencies and increased lagged linear connectivity in slow frequencies in relation to the activity of remaining cortex. Conclusions: Topographical EEG measures of functional connectivity detect regional dysfunction of AD-vulnerable brain areas as evidenced by association and spatial overlap with the cortical glucose hypometabolism in MCI and AD patients. Impact statement The association between glucose hypometabolism, as evidenced by [18F]FDG-PET ([18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography), and altered electroencephalography (EEG) functional connectivity metrics within temporoparietal lobes provides link between synaptic, neurophysiological, and metabolic impairment in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients. This study reported alterations in EEG measures of both instantaneous and lagged linear connectivity across distinct frequency bands, both of which were shown to be important for inter- and intrahemispheric communication and function of memory systems in general. EEG-based imaging of brain functional connectivity has a potential to serve as a noninvasive, low-cost, and widely available alternative in assessing synaptic and network dysfunction in cognitively impaired patients.",

While these models mimic rather well various biochemical aspects of the disease, such as Abeta-aggregation, they are also prone to overexpression artifacts and to complex phenotypical alterations, due to genes affected in or close to the insertion site(s) of the mini-genes (Sasaguri et al., EMBO J 36:2473-87, 2017; Goodwin et al., Genome Res 29:494-505, 2019). Knock-in strategies which introduce clinical mutants in a humanized endogenous rodent APP sequence (Saito et al., Nat Neurosci 17:661-3, 2014) represent useful improvements, but need to be compared with appropriate humanized wildtype (WT) mice. METHODS: Computational modelling of the human beta-CTF bound to BACE1 was used to study the differential processing of rodent and human APP. We humanized the three pivotal residues we identified G676R, F681Y and R684H (labeled according to the human APP770 isoform) in the mouse and rat genomes using a CRISPR-Cas9 approach. These new models, termed mouse and rat Apphu/hu, express APP from the endogenous promotor. We also introduced the early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutation M139T into the endogenous Rat Psen1 gene. RESULTS: We show that introducing these three amino acid substitutions into the rodent sequence lowers the affinity of the APP substrate for BACE1 cleavage. The effect on beta-secretase processing was confirmed as both humanized rodent models produce three times more (human) Abeta compared to the original WT strain. These models represent suitable controls, or starting points, for studying the effect of transgenes or knock-in mutations on APP processing (Saito et al., Nat Neurosci 17:661-3, 2014). We introduced the early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutation M139T into the endogenous Rat Psen1 gene and provide an initial characterization of Abeta processing in this novel rat AD model. CONCLUSION: The different humanized APP models (rat and mouse) expressing human Abeta and PSEN1 M139T are valuable controls to study APP processing in vivo allowing the use of a human Abeta ELISA which is more sensitive than the equivalent system for rodents. These animals will be made available to the research community.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trials with anti-tau drugs will need to target individuals at risk of accumulating tau. Our objective was to identify variables available in a research setting that predict future rates of tau PET accumulation separately among individuals who were either cognitively unimpaired or cognitively impaired. All 337 participants had: a baseline study visit with MRI, amyloid PET, and tau PET exams, at least one follow-up tau PET exam; and met clinical criteria for membership in one of two clinical diagnostic groups: cognitively unimpaired (n = 203); or cognitively impaired (n = 134, a combined group of participants with either mild cognitive impairment or dementia with Alzheimer's clinical syndrome). Our primary analyses were in these two clinical groups; however, we also evaluated subgroups dividing the unimpaired group by normal/abnormal amyloid PET and the impaired group by clinical phenotype (mild cognitive impairment, amnestic dementia, and non-amnestic dementia). Linear mixed effects models were used to estimate associations between age, sex, education, APOE genotype, amyloid and tau PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), cognitive performance, cortical thickness, and white matter hyperintensity volume at baseline, and the rate of subsequent tau PET accumulation. Log-transformed tau PET SUVR was used as the response and rates were summarized as annual per cent change. A temporal lobe tau PET meta-region of interest was used. In the cognitively unimpaired group, only higher baseline amyloid PET was a significant independent predictor of higher tau accumulation rates (P < 0.001). Higher rates of tau accumulation were associated with faster rates of cognitive decline in the cognitively unimpaired subgroup with abnormal amyloid PET (P = 0.03), but among the subgroup with normal amyloid PET. In the cognitively impaired group, younger age (P = 0.02), higher baseline amyloid PET (P = 0.05), APOE epsilon4 (P = 0.05), and better cognitive performance (P = 0.05) were significant independent predictors of higher tau accumulation rates. Among impaired individuals, faster cognitive decline was associated with faster rates of tau accumulation (P = 0.01). While we examined many possible predictor variables, our results indicate that screening of unimpaired individuals for potential inclusion in anti-tau trials may be straightforward because the only independent predictor of high tau rates was amyloidosis. In cognitively impaired individuals, imaging and clinical variables consistent with early onset Alzheimer's disease phenotype were associated with higher rates of tau PET accumulation suggesting this may be a highly advantageous group in which to conduct proof-of-concept clinical trials that target tau-related mechanisms. The nature of the dementia phenotype (amnestic versus non-amnestic) did not affect this conclusion.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently untreatable, and therapeutic strategies aimed to slow cognitive decline have not yet been successful. Many of these approaches have targeted the amyloid cascade, indicating that novel treatment strategies are required. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified a number of risk factors in genes expressed in microglia, underscoring their therapeutic potential in neurodegeneration. In this review, we discuss how the recently defined functions of these AD risk genes can be targeted therapeutically to modulate microglial cell state and slow the progression of AD. Antibody-mediated stimulation of the triggering receptor of myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is on the forefront of these candidate therapeutic approaches based on a combination of compelling human genetics and emerging preclinical data. This and other approaches to modify microglial function are a topic of intensive study and provide an opportunity for innovative AD treatments, which may be applied alone or potentially in combination with classical anti-amyloid therapies.",

Among the molecular imaging biomarkers, amyloid-PET, which assesses brain amyloid deposition, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET, which assesses glucose metabolism, provide valuable and complementary information. However, uncertainty remains regarding the optimal timepoint, combination, and an order in which these PET biomarkers should be used in diagnostic evaluations because conclusive evidence is missing. Following an expert panel discussion, we reached an agreement on the specific use of the individual biomarkers, based on available evidence and clinical expertise. We propose a diagnostic algorithm with optimal timepoints for these PET biomarkers, also taking into account evidence from other biomarkers, for early and differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases that can lead to dementia. We propose three main diagnostic pathways with distinct biomarker sequences, in which amyloid-PET and 18F-FDG-PET are placed at different positions in the order of diagnostic evaluations, depending on clinical presentation. We hope that this algorithm can support diagnostic decision making in specialist clinical settings with access to these biomarkers and might stimulate further research towards optimal diagnostic strategies.",

    "abstract": "The 4-subunit intramembrane protease complex gamma-secretase cleaves many substrates including fragments of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to formation of Abeta peptides, and Notch. Mutations in APP and the catalytic subunit of gamma-secretase, presenilin, cause familial Alzheimer's disease (fAD). Mutations are assumed to change the substrate-binding and cleavage and thereby the Abeta formed. Whereas a wild-type structure of substrate-bound gamma-secretase became recently available from cryogenic electron microscopy (6IYC), the structure and dynamics of mutant proteins remain obscure. Here, we studied five prominent mutants of substrate-bound gamma-secretase by explicit all-atom molecular dynamics in a phospholipid membrane model at physiological temperature using the experimental structure as template: The presenilin 1 mutants E280A, G384A, A434C, and L435F and the V717I mutant of APP. Our structures and dynamics provide the first atomic detail into how fAD-causing mutations affect substrate binding to gamma-secretase. The pathogenic mutations tend to increase the space and variability in the substrate binding site, as seen e.g. from the distance from catalytic aspartate to substrate cleavage sites. We suggest that we have identified the molecular cause of the \"imprecise cleavage\" that leads to two trimming pathways in gamma-secretase, consistent with the FIST model, which may rationalize the experimental Abeta42/Abeta40 ratios as a molecular basis for fAD.",

We developed a machine-learning classifier to integrate this multi-omic framework and predict dozens of functional SNPs for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, nominating target genes and cell types for previously orphaned loci from genome-wide association studies. Moreover, we dissected the complex inverted haplotype of the MAPT (encoding tau) Parkinson's disease risk locus, identifying putative ectopic regulatory interactions in neurons that may mediate this disease association.

In recent times, there has been a burgeoning interest in the investigation of intriguing behavior of IDPs using highly multidisciplinary and complementary approaches due to the pivotal role of this unique class of protein chameleons in physiology and disease. Over the past decade or so, our laboratory has been actively investigating the unique physicochemical properties of this class of highly dynamic, flexible, rapidly interconverting proteins. We have utilized a diverse array of existing and emerging tools involving steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence, Raman spectroscopy, circular dichroism, light scattering, fluorescence microscopy, and atomic force microscopy coupled with site-directed mutagenesis and other biochemical and biophysical tools to study a variety of interesting and important aspects of IDPs. In this Feature Article, I describe our work on the conformational characteristics, solvation dynamics, binding-induced folding, amyloid formation, and liquid-liquid phase separation of a number of amyloidogenic IDPs. A series of these studies described here captures the role of conformational plasticity and dynamics in directing binding, folding, assembly, aggregation, and phase transitions implicated in physiology and pathology.",

    "title": "alpha-Secretase nonsense mutation (ADAM10 Tyr167*) in familial Alzheimer's disease.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The disintegrin metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) is the main alpha-secretase acting in the non-amyloidogenic processing of APP. Some ADAM10 gene variants have been associated with higher susceptibility to develop late-onset AD, though clear clinical-genetic correlates remain elusive. METHODS: Clinical-genetic and biomarker study of a first family with early- and late-onset AD associated with a nonsense ADAM10 mutation (p.Tyr167*). CSF analysis included AD core biomarkers, as well as Western blot of ADAM10 species and sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta peptides. We evaluate variant's pathogenicity, pattern of segregation, and further screened for the p.Tyr167* mutation in 197 familial AD cases from the same cohort, 200 controls from the same background, and 274 AD cases from an independent Spanish cohort. RESULTS: The mutation was absent from public databases and segregated with the disease. CSF Abeta42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau of affected siblings were consistent with AD. The predicted haploinsufficiency effect of the nonsense mutation was supported by (a) ADAM10 isoforms in CSF decreased around 50% and (b) 70% reduction of CSF sAPPalpha peptide, both compared to controls, while sAPPbeta levels remained unchanged. Interestingly, sporadic AD cases had a similar decrease in CSF ADAM10 levels to that of mutants, though their sAPPalpha and sAPPbeta levels resembled those of controls. Therefore, a decreased sAPPalpha/sAPPbeta ratio was an exclusive feature of mutant ADAM10 siblings. The p.Tyr167* mutation was not found in any of the other AD cases or controls screened. CONCLUSIONS: This family illustrates the role of ADAM10 in the amyloidogenic process and the clinical development of the disease. Similarities between clinical and biomarker findings suggest that this family could represent a genetic model for sporadic late-onset AD due to age-related downregulation of alpha-secretase. This report encourages future research on ADAM10 enhancers.",

    "abstract": "Detecting amyloid beta (Abeta) in unpurified blood to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) is challenging owing to low concentrations of Abeta and the presence of many other substances in the blood. Here, we propose a 3D sensor for AD diagnosis using blood plasma, with pairs of 3D silicon micropillar electrodes with a comprehensive circuit configuration. The sensor is developed with synthesized artificial peptide and impedance analysis based on a maximum signal-to-noise ratio. Its sensitivity and selectivity were verified using an in vitro test based on samples of human blood serum, which showed its feasibility for application in diagnosis of AD by testing blood plasma of the AD patient. The 3D sensor is designed to improve reliability by checking the impedance of each pair multiple times via constructing a reference pair and a working pair on the same sensor. Therefore, we demonstrate the ability of the 3D sensor to recognize cases of AD using blood plasma and introduce its potential as a self-health care sensor for AD patients.",

    "abstract": "Aducanumab recently underwent two large phase III clinical trials that were stopped prematurely by the sponsor Biogen. One trial was trending positive while the other showed no benefits from aducanumab. Post hoc analyses led the sponsor to assert that there was a sufficient efficacy signal to justify a new drug application as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The sponsor claimed that subsets of participants receiving sufficiently high doses of aducanumab demonstrated benefits in both trials. In contrast, we identified alternative accounts for the apparent drug benefits in post hoc subgroups that are unrelated to dose effects. Biomarker data were consistent with target engagement, but no evidence was presented to correlate biomarker changes to cognitive benefits. Our analysis supports the conduct of a third, phase III trial with high-dose aducanumab. Aducanumab's efficacy as a treatment for the cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease cannot be proven by clinical trials with divergent outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive accumulation of senile plaques, which are primarily composed of misfolded amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). Abeta aggregates are believed to be a key factor in the pathogenesis of AD, affecting the nervous system in human body. The therapeutic potential of tea-derived polyphenolic compounds, (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), for AD was investigated by assessing their effects on the Cu2+/Zn2+-induced or self-assembled Abeta40 aggregation using thioflavine T fluorescent spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, UV-Vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscope, silver staining, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence assays. EGC and ECG mildly bind to Cu2+ and Zn2+, and diminish the Cu2+- or Zn2+-induced or self-assembled Abeta aggregates; they also modulate the Cu2+/Zn2+-Abeta40 induced neurotoxicity on mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells by reducing the production of ROS. Metal chelating, hydrogen bonding or Van Der Waals force may drive the interaction between the polyphenolic compounds and Abeta. The results demonstrate that green tea catechins EGC and ECG are able to alleviate the toxicity of Abeta oligomers and fibrils. Particularly, ECG can cross the blood-brain barrier to reduce the Abeta plaques in the brain of APP/PS1 mice, thereby protecting neurons from injuries. The results manifest the potential of green tea for preventing or ameliorating the symptoms of AD.",

    "abstract": "MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables label-free, spatially resolved analysis of a wide range of analytes in tissue sections. Quantitative analysis of MSI datasets is typically performed on single pixels or manually assigned regions of interest (ROIs). However, many sparse, small objects such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain deposits of amyloid peptides called plaques are neither single pixels nor ROIs. Here, we propose a new approach to facilitate the comparative computational evaluation of amyloid plaque-like objects by MSI: a fast PLAQUE PICKER tool that enables a statistical evaluation of heterogeneous amyloid peptide composition. Comparing two AD mouse models, APP NL-G-F and APP PS1, we identified distinct heterogeneous plaque populations in the NL-G-F model but only one class of plaques in the PS1 model. We propose quantitative metrics for the comparison of technical and biological MSI replicates. Furthermore, we reconstructed a high-accuracy 3D-model of amyloid plaques in a fully automated fashion, employing rigid and elastic MSI image registration using structured and plaque-unrelated reference ion images. Statistical single-plaque analysis in reconstructed 3D-MSI objects revealed the Abeta1-42Arc peptide to be located either in the core of larger plaques or in small plaques without colocalization of other Abeta isoforms. In 3D, a substantially larger number of small plaques were observed than that indicated by the 2D-MSI data, suggesting that quantitative analysis of molecularly diverse sparsely-distributed features may benefit from 3D-reconstruction.

In this study, we applied two interpretable machine learning algorithms, gradient boosting machine (GBM) and random forest (RF), to predict Abeta PET positivity in patients with CAA MRI markers. In the GBM algorithm, the number of lobar cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), deep CMBs, lacunes, CMBs in dentate nuclei, and age were ranked as the most influential to predict Abeta positivity. In the RF algorithm, the absence of diabetes was additionally chosen. Cut-off values of the above variables predictive of Abeta positivity were as follows: (1) the number of lobar CMBs > 16.4(GBM)/14.3(RF), (2) no deep CMBs(GBM/RF), (3) the number of lacunes > 7.4(GBM/RF), (4) age > 74.3(GBM)/64(RF), (5) no CMBs in dentate nucleus(GBM/RF). The classification performances based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.83 in GBM and 0.80 in RF.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence of amyloid-beta and tau deposition in the brain, hippocampal atrophy and increased rates of hippocampal atrophy over time. Another protein, TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) has been identified in up to 75% of cases of Alzheimer's disease. TDP-43, tau and amyloid-beta have all been linked to hippocampal atrophy. TDP-43 and tau have also been linked to hippocampal atrophy in cases of primary age-related tauopathy, a pathological entity with features that strongly overlap with those of Alzheimer's disease. At present, it is unclear whether and how TDP-43 and tau are associated with early or late hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease and primary age-related tauopathy, whether either protein is also associated with faster rates of atrophy of other brain regions and whether there is evidence for protein-associated acceleration/deceleration of atrophy rates. We therefore aimed to model how these proteins, particularly TDP-43, influence non-linear trajectories of hippocampal and neocortical atrophy in Alzheimer's disease and primary age-related tauopathy. In this longitudinal retrospective study, 557 autopsied cases with Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes with 1638 ante-mortem volumetric head MRI scans spanning 1.0-16.8 years of disease duration prior to death were analysed. TDP-43 and Braak neurofibrillary tangle pathological staging schemes were constructed, and hippocampal and neocortical (inferior temporal and middle frontal) brain volumes determined using longitudinal FreeSurfer. Bayesian bivariate-outcome hierarchical models were utilized to estimate associations between proteins and volume, early rate of atrophy and acceleration in atrophy rates across brain regions. High TDP-43 stage was associated with smaller cross-sectional brain volumes, faster rates of brain atrophy and acceleration of atrophy rates, more than a decade prior to death, with deceleration occurring closer to death. Stronger associations were observed with hippocampus compared to temporal and frontal neocortex. Conversely, low TDP-43 stage was associated with slower early rates but later acceleration. This later acceleration was associated with high Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage. Somewhat similar, but less striking, findings were observed between TDP-43 and neocortical rates. Braak stage appeared to have stronger associations with neocortex compared to TDP-43. The association between TDP-43 and brain atrophy occurred slightly later in time (~3 years) in cases of primary age-related tauopathy compared to Alzheimer's disease. The results suggest that TDP-43 and tau have different contributions to acceleration and deceleration of brain atrophy rates over time in both Alzheimer's disease and primary age-related tauopathy.",

    "title": "Amyloid-beta oligomers induce Parkin-mediated mitophagy by reducing Miro1.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with the accumulation of amyloid-beta oligomers (AbetaO). Recent studies have demonstrated that mitochondria-specific autophagy (mitophagy) contributes to mitochondrial quality control by selectively eliminating the dysfunctional mitochondria. Mitochondria motility, which is regulated by Miro1, is also associated with neuronal cell functions. However, the role played by Miro1 in the mitophagy mechanism, especially relative to AbetaO and neurodegenerative disorders, remains unknown. In this study, AbetaO induced mitochondrial dysfunction, enhanced Parkin-mediated mitophagy, and reduced mitochondrial quantities in hippocampal neuronal cells (HT-22 cells). We demonstrated that AbetaO-induced mitochondrial fragmentation could be rescued to the elongated mitochondrial form and that mitophagy could be mitigated by the stable overexpression of Miro1 or by pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC)-a reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger-as assessed by immunocytochemistry. Moreover, using time-lapse imaging, under live cell-conditions, we verified that mitochondrial motility was rescued by the Miro1 overexpression. Finally, in hippocampus from amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1)/Tau triple-transgenic mice, we noted that the co-localization between mitochondria and LC3B puncta was increased. Taken together, these results indicated that up-regulated ROS, induced by AbetaO, increased the degree of mitophagy and decreased the Miro1 expression levels. In contrast, the Miro1 overexpression ameliorated AbetaO-mediated mitophagy and increased the mitochondrial motility. In AD model mice, AbetaO induced mitophagy in the hippocampus. Thus, our results would improve our understanding of the role of mitophagy in AD toward facilitating the development of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of AbetaO-mediated diseases.",

However, the role of non-neuronal cells in this chain of events remains unclear. In the present study, we found accumulation of tau in hilar astrocytes of the dentate gyrus of individuals with AD. In mice, the overexpression of 3R tau specifically in hilar astrocytes of the dentate gyrus altered mitochondrial dynamics and function. In turn, these changes led to a reduction of adult neurogenesis, parvalbumin-expressing neurons, inhibitory synapses and hilar gamma oscillations, which were accompanied by impaired spatial memory performances. Together, these results indicate that the loss of tau homeostasis in hilar astrocytes of the dentate gyrus is sufficient to induce AD-like symptoms, through the impairment of the neuronal network. These results are important for our understanding of disease mechanisms and underline the crucial role of astrocytes in hippocampal function.",

    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau phosphorylation in the brain and its subsequent release into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood is a dynamic process that changes during disease evolution. The main aim of our study was to characterize the pattern of changes in phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in the preclinical stage of the Alzheimer's continuum. We measured three novel CSF p-tau biomarkers, phosphorylated at threonine-181 and threonine-217 with an N-terminal partner antibody and at threonine-231 with a mid-region partner antibody. These were compared with an automated mid-region p-tau181 assay (Elecsys) as the gold standard p-tau measure. We demonstrate that these novel p-tau biomarkers increase more prominently in preclinical Alzheimer, when only subtle changes of amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology are detected, and can accurately differentiate Abeta-positive from Abeta-negative cognitively unimpaired individuals. Moreover, we show that the novel plasma N-terminal p-tau181 biomarker is mildly but significantly increased in the preclinical stage. Our results support the idea that early changes in neuronal tau metabolism in preclinical Alzheimer, likely in response to Abeta exposure, can be detected with these novel p-tau assays.",

    "abstract": "The role of proteomic instability in cancer, particularly amyloidogenesis, remains obscure. Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) transcriptionally governs the proteotoxic stress response to suppress proteomic instability and enhance survival. Paradoxically, HSF1 promotes oncogenesis. Here, we report that AKT activates HSF1 via Ser230 phosphorylation. In vivo, HSF1 enables megalencephaly and hepatomegaly, which are driven by hyperactive phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling. Hsf1 deficiency exacerbates amyloidogenesis and elicits apoptosis, thereby countering tissue overgrowth. Unexpectedly, HSF1 physically neutralizes soluble amyloid oligomers (AOs). Beyond impeding amyloidogenesis, HSF1 shields HSP60 from direct assault by AOs, averting HSP60 destabilization, collapse of the mitochondrial proteome, and, ultimately, mitophagy and apoptosis. The very same mechanism occurs in Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that amyloidogenesis may be a checkpoint mechanism that constrains uncontrolled growth and safeguards tissue homeostasis, congruent with its emerging tumor-suppressive function. HSF1, by acting as an anti-amyloid factor, promotes overgrowth syndromes and cancer but may suppress neurodegenerative disorders.",

The exact mechanism behind the neurodegeneration is still unclear, but recent data suggests that spreading of amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology via extracellular vesicles (EVs) may contribute to disease progression. We have previously shown that an incomplete degradation of Abeta42 protofibrils by astrocytes results in the release of EVs containing neurotoxic Abeta. Here, we describe the cellular mechanisms behind EV-associated neurotoxicity in detail. EVs were isolated from untreated and Abeta42 protofibril exposed neuroglial co-cultures, consisting mainly of astrocytes. The EVs were added to cortical neurons for 2 or 4 days and the neurodegenerative processes were followed with immunocytochemistry, time-lapse imaging and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Addition of EVs from Abeta42 protofibril exposed co-cultures resulted in synaptic loss, severe mitochondrial impairment and apoptosis. TEM analysis demonstrated that the EVs induced axonal swelling and vacuolization of the neuronal cell bodies. Interestingly, EV exposed neurons also displayed pathological lamellar bodies of cholesterol deposits in lysosomal compartments. Taken together, our data show that the secretion of EVs from Abeta exposed cells induces neuronal dysfunction in several ways, indicating a central role for EVs in the progression of Abeta-induced pathology.",

    "title": "Functional Integrity of Synapses in the Central Nervous System of Cognitively Intact Individuals with High Alzheimer's Disease Neuropathology Is Associated with Absence of Synaptic Tau Oligomers.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Certain individuals, here referred to as Non-Demented with Alzheimer Neuropathology (NDAN), do not show overt neurodegeneration (N-) and remain cognitively intact despite the presence of plaques (A+) and tangles (T+) that would normally be consistent with fully symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: The existence of NDAN (A + T+N-) subjects suggests that the human brain utilizes intrinsic mechanisms that can naturally evade cognitive decline normally associated with the symptomatic stages of AD (A + T+N+). Deciphering the underlying mechanisms would prove relevant to develop complementing therapeutics to prevent progression of AD-related cognitive decline. METHODS: Previously, we have reported that NDAN present with preserved neurogenesis and synaptic integrity paralleled by absence of amyloid oligomers at synapses. Using postmortem brain samples from age-matched control subjects, demented AD patients and NDAN individuals, we performed immunofluorescence, western blots, micro transplantation of synaptic membranes in Xenopus oocytes followed by twin electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology and fluorescence assisted single synaptosome-long term potentiation studies. RESULTS: We report decreased tau oligomers at synapses in the brains of NDAN subjects. Furthermore, using novel approaches we report, for the first time, that such absence of tau oligomers at synapses is associated with synaptic functional integrity in NDAN subjects as compared to demented AD patients. CONCLUSION: Overall, these results give further credence to tau oligomers as primary actors of synaptic destruction underscoring cognitive demise in AD and support their targeting as a viable therapeutic strategy for AD and related tauopathies.",

    "abstract": "To elucidate the role of Tau isoforms and post-translational modification (PTM) stoichiometry in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we generated a high-resolution quantitative proteomics map of 95 PTMs on multiple isoforms of Tau isolated from postmortem human tissue from 49 AD and 42 control subjects. Although Tau PTM maps reveal heterogeneity across subjects, a subset of PTMs display high occupancy and frequency for AD, suggesting importance in disease. Unsupervised analyses indicate that PTMs occur in an ordered manner, leading to Tau aggregation. The processive addition and minimal set of PTMs associated with seeding activity was further defined by analysis of size-fractionated Tau. To summarize, features in the Tau protein critical for disease intervention at different stages of disease are identified, including enrichment of 0N and 4R isoforms, underrepresentation of the C terminus, an increase in negative charge in the proline-rich region (PRR), and a decrease in positive charge in the microtubule binding domain (MBD).",

    "title": "Targeting isoaspartate-modified Abeta rescues behavioral deficits in transgenic mice with Alzheimer's disease-like pathology.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyloid beta (Abeta)-directed immunotherapy has shown promising results in preclinical and early clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) trials, but successful translation to late clinics has failed so far. Compelling evidence suggests that post-translationally modified Abeta peptides might play a decisive role in onset and progression of AD and first clinical trials targeting such Abeta variants have been initiated. Modified Abeta represents a small fraction of deposited material in plaques compared to pan-Abeta epitopes, opening up pathways for tailored approaches of immunotherapy. Here, we generated the first monoclonal antibodies that recognize L-isoaspartate-modified Abeta (isoD7-Abeta) and tested a lead antibody molecule in 5xFAD mice. METHODS: This work comprises a combination of chemical and biochemical techniques as well as behavioral analyses. Abeta peptides, containing L-isoaspartate at position 7, were chemically synthesized and used for immunization of mice and antibody screening methods. Biochemical methods included anti-isoD7-Abeta monoclonal antibody characterization by surface plasmon resonance, immunohistochemical staining of human and transgenic mouse brain, and the development and application of isoD7-Abeta ELISA as well as different non-modified Abeta ELISA. For antibody treatment studies, 12 mg/kg anti-isoD7-Abeta antibody K11_IgG2a was applied intraperitoneally to 5xFAD mice for 38 weeks. Treatment controls implemented were IgG2a isotype as negative and 3D6_IgG2a, the parent molecule of bapineuzumab, as positive control antibodies. Behavioral studies included elevated plus maze, pole test, and Morris water maze. RESULTS: Our advanced antibody K11 showed a KD in the low nM range and > 400fold selectivity for isoD7-Abeta compared to other Abeta variants. By using this antibody, we demonstrated that formation of isoD7-Abeta may occur after formation of aggregates; hence, the presence of the isoD7-modification differentiates aged Abeta from newly formed peptides. Importantly, we also show that the Tottori mutation responsible for early-onset AD in a Japanese pedigree is characterized by massively accelerated formation of isoD7-Abeta in cell culture. The presence of isoD7-Abeta was verified by K11 in post mortem human cortex and 5xFAD mouse brain tissue. Passive immunization of 5xFAD mice resulted in a significant reduction of isoD7-Abeta and total Abeta in brain. Amelioration of cognitive impairment was demonstrated by Morris water maze, elevated plus maze, pole, and contextual fear conditioning tests. Interestingly, despite the lower abundance of the isoD7-Abeta epitope, the application of anti-isoD7-Abeta antibodies showed comparable treatment efficacy in terms of reduction of brain amyloid and spatial learning but did not result in an increase of plasma Abeta concentration as observed with 3D6 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates, for the first time, that the antibody-mediated targeting of isoD7-modified Abeta peptides leads to attenuation of AD-like amyloid pathology. In conjunction with previously published data on antibodies directed against pGlu-modified Abeta, the results highlight the crucial role of modified Abeta peptides in AD pathophysiology. Hence, the results also underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting modified amyloid species for defining tailored approaches in AD therapy.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We previously found temporoparietal-predominant atrophy patterns in the behavioral variant of Alzheimer's disease (bvAD), with relative sparing of frontal regions. Here, we aimed to understand the clinico-anatomical dissociation in bvAD based on alternative neuroimaging markers. METHODS: We retrospectively included 150 participants, including 29 bvAD, 28 \"typical\" amnestic-predominant AD (tAD), 28 behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and 65 cognitively normal participants. Patients with bvAD were compared with other diagnostic groups on glucose metabolism and metabolic connectivity measured by [18F]FDG-PET, and on subcortical gray matter and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes measured by MRI. A receiver-operating-characteristic-analysis was performed to determine the neuroimaging measures with highest diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: bvAD and tAD showed predominant temporoparietal hypometabolism compared to controls, and did not differ in direct contrasts. However, overlaying statistical maps from contrasts between patients and controls revealed broader frontoinsular hypometabolism in bvAD than tAD, partially overlapping with bvFTD. bvAD showed greater anterior default mode network (DMN) involvement than tAD, mimicking bvFTD, and reduced connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex with prefrontal regions. Analyses of WMH and subcortical volume showed closer resemblance of bvAD to tAD than to bvFTD, and larger amygdalar volumes in bvAD than tAD respectively. The top-3 discriminators for bvAD vs. bvFTD were FDG posterior-DMN-ratios (bvAD<bvFTD), MRI posterior-DMN-ratios (bvAD<bvFTD), MRI salience-network-ratios (bvAD>bvFTD, area under the curve [AUC] range 0.85-0.91, all p < 0.001). The top-3 for bvAD vs. tAD were amygdalar volume (bvAD>tAD), MRI anterior-DMN-ratios (bvAD<tAD), FDG anterior-DMN-ratios (bvAD<tAD, AUC range 0.71-0.84, all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Subtle frontoinsular hypometabolism and anterior DMN involvement may underlie the prominent behavioral phenotype in bvAD.",

    "abstract": "Methods: Alzheimer's disease and Frontotemporal dementia are the first and third most common forms of dementia. Due to their similar clinical symptoms, they are easily misdiagnosed as each other even with sophisticated clinical guidelines. For disease-specific intervention and treatment, it is essential to develop a computer-aided system to improve the accuracy of their differential diagnosis. Recent advances in deep learning have delivered some of the best performance for medical image recognition tasks. However, its application to the differential diagnosis of AD and FTD pathology has not been explored. Approach: In this study, we proposed a novel deep learning based framework to distinguish between brain images of normal aging individuals and subjects with AD and FTD. Specifically, we combined the multi-scale and multi-type MRI-base image features with Generative Adversarial Network data augmentation technique to improve the differential diagnosis accuracy. Results: Each of the multi-scale, multitype, and data augmentation methods improved the ability for differential diagnosis for both AD and FTD. A 10-fold cross validation experiment performed on a large sample of 1,954 images using the proposed framework achieved a high overall accuracy of 88.28%. Conclusions: The salient contributions of this study are three-fold: (1) our experiments demonstrate that the combination of multiple structural features extracted at different scales with our proposed deep neural network yields superior performance than individual features; (2) we show that the use of Generative Adversarial Network for data augmentation could further improve the discriminant ability of the network regarding challenging tasks such as differentiating dementia sub-types; (3) and finally, we show that ensemble classifier strategy could make the network more robust and stable.",

    "abstract": "The immunological responses are a key pathological factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesized that microglial polarization alters microglia-astrocyte immune interactions in AD. M1 and M2 microglia were isolated from primary rat microglia and were confirmed to secrete pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors, respectively. Primary rat astrocytes were co-cultured with M1 or M2 microglial medium. M1 microglial medium increased astrocyte production of pro-inflammatory factors (interleukin [IL]-1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-6), while M2 microglial medium enhanced astrocyte production of anti-inflammatory factors (IL-4 and IL-10). To analyze the crosstalk between microglia and astrocytes after microglial polarization specifically in AD, we co-cultured astrocytes with medium from microglia treated with amyloid-beta (Abeta) alone or in combination with other inflammatory substances. Abeta alone and Abeta combined with lipopolysaccharide/interferon-gamma induced pro-inflammatory activity in M1 microglia and astrocytes, whereas IL-4/IL-13 inhibited Abeta-induced pro-inflammatory activity. Nuclear factor kappaB p65 was upregulated in M1 microglia and pro-inflammatory astrocytes, while Stat6 was upregulated in M2 microglia and anti-inflammatory astrocytes. These results provide direct evidence that microglial polarization governs communication between microglia and astrocytes, and that AD debris alters this crosstalk.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: TREM2 is a microglial cell surface receptor, with risk mutations linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), including R47H. TREM2 signalling via SYK aids phagocytosis, chemotaxis, survival, and changes to microglial activation state. In AD mouse models, knockout (KO) of TREM2 impairs microglial clustering around amyloid and prevents microglial activation. The R47H mutation is proposed to reduce TREM2 ligand binding. We investigated cell phenotypes of the R47H mutant and TREM2 KO in a model of human microglia, and compared their transcriptional signatures, to determine the mechanism by which R47H TREM2 disrupts function. METHODS: We generated human microglia-like iPSC-macrophages (pMac) from isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines, with homozygous R47H mutation or TREM2 knockout (KO). We firstly validated the effect of the R47H mutant on TREM2 surface and subcellular localization in pMac. To assess microglial phenotypic function, we measured phagocytosis of dead neurons, cell morphology, directed migration, survival, and LPS-induced inflammation. We performed bulk RNA-seq, comparing significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs; p < 0.05) between the R47H and KO versus WT, and bioinformatically predicted potential upstream regulators of TREM2-mediated gene expression. RESULTS: R47H modified surface expression and shedding of TREM2, but did not impair TREM2-mediated signalling, or gross phenotypes that were dysregulated in the TREM2 KO (phagocytosis, motility, survival). However, altered gene expression in the R47H TREM2 pMac overlapped by 90% with the TREM2 KO and was characterised by dysregulation of genes involved with immunity, proliferation, activation, chemotaxis, and adhesion. Downregulated mediators of ECM adhesion included the vitronectin receptor alphaVbeta3, and consequently, R47H TREM2 pMac adhered weakly to vitronectin compared with WT pMac. To counteract these transcriptional defects, we investigated TGFbeta1, as a candidate upstream regulator. TGFbeta1 failed to rescue vitronectin adhesion of pMac, although it improved alphaVbeta3 expression. CONCLUSIONS: The R47H mutation is not sufficient to cause gross phenotypic defects of human pMac under standard culture conditions. However, overlapping transcriptional defects with TREM2 KO supports the hypothesised partial loss-of-function effects of the R47H mutation. Furthermore, transcriptomics can guide us to more subtle phenotypic defects in the R47H cells, such as reduced cell adhesion, and can be used to predict targets for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that plasma total tau (t-tau) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) concentrations may have a differential role in the study of frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes (FTLD-S) and clinically diagnosed Alzheimer disease syndromes (AD-S), we determined their diagnostic and prognostic value in FTLD-S and AD-S and their sensitivity to pathologic diagnoses. METHODS: We measured plasma t-tau and NfL with the Simoa platform in 265 participants: 167 FTLD-S, 43 AD-S, and 55 healthy controls (HC), including 82 pathology-proven cases (50 FTLD-tau, 18 FTLD-TDP, 2 FTLD-FUS, and 12 AD) and 98 participants with amyloid PET. We compared cross-sectional and longitudinal biomarker concentrations between groups, their correlation with clinical measures of disease severity, progression, and survival, and cortical thickness. RESULTS: Plasma NfL, but not plasma t-tau, discriminated FTLD-S from HC and AD-S from HC. Both plasma NfL and t-tau were poor discriminators between FLTD-S and AD-S. In pathology-confirmed cases, plasma NfL was higher in FTLD than AD and in FTLD-TDP compared to FTLD-tau, after accounting for age and disease severity. Plasma NfL, but not plasma t-tau, predicted clinical decline and survival and correlated with regional cortical thickness in both FTLD-S and AD-S. The combination of plasma NfL with plasma t-tau did not outperform plasma NfL alone. CONCLUSION: Plasma NfL is superior to plasma t-tau for the diagnosis and prediction of clinical progression of FTLD-S and AD-S. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that plasma NfL has superior diagnostic and prognostic performance vs plasma t-tau in FTLD and AD.",

    "abstract": "Many amyloid-driven pathologies have both genetic and stochastic components where assessing risk of disease development requires a multifactorial assessment where many of the variables are poorly understood. Risk of transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis is enhanced by age and mutation of the transthyretin (TTR) gene, but amyloidosis is not directly initiated by mutated TTR proteins. Nearly all of the 150+ known mutations increase dissociation of the homotetrameric protein structure and increase the probability of an individual developing a TTR amyloid disease late in life. TTR amyloidosis is caused by dissociated monomers that are destabilized and refold into an amyloidogenic form. Therefore, monomer concentration, monomer proteolysis rate, and structural stability are key variables that may determine the rate of development of amyloidosis. Here we develop a unifying biophysical model that quantifies the relationships among these variables in plasma and suggest the probability of an individual developing a TTR amyloid disease can be estimated. This may allow quantification of risk for amyloidosis and provide the information necessary for development of methods for early diagnosis and prevention. Given the similar observation of genetic and sporadic amyloidoses for other diseases, this model and the measurements to assess risk may be applicable to more proteins than just TTR.",

We hypothesized that the spatial distribution of brain Abeta predicts future dementia conversion in individuals with DS. Methods: We acquired 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography scans from 19 nondemented individuals with DS at baseline and monitored them for 4 years, with five individuals transitioning to dementia. Machine learning classification using an independent test set determined features on 18F-florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio maps that predicted transition. Results: In addition to \"AD signature\" regions including the inferior parietal cortex, temporal lobes, and the cingulum, we found that Abeta cortical binding in the prefrontal and superior frontal cortices distinguished subjects who transitioned to dementia. Classification did well in predicting transitioners. Discussion: Our study suggests that specific regional profiles of brain amyloid in older adults with DS may predict cognitive decline and are informative in evaluating the risk for dementia.",

We uncover a complex temporal trajectory of microglial-immune pathways involving the type 1 interferon response associated with tau pathology in the early stages, followed by later signatures of partial immune suppression and, subsequently, the type 2 interferon response. We find that genetic risk for dementias shows disease-specific patterns of pathway enrichment. We identify drivers of two gene co-expression modules conserved from mouse to human, representing competing arms of microglial-immune activation (NAct) and suppression (NSupp) in neurodegeneration. We validate our findings by using chemogenetics, experimental perturbation data, and single-cell sequencing in post-mortem brains. Our results refine the understanding of stage- and disease-specific microglial responses, implicate microglial viral defense pathways in dementia pathophysiology, and highlight therapeutic windows.",

    "abstract": "Axonal dystrophy, indicative of perturbed axonal transport, occurs early during Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying this initial sign of the pathology. This study proves that Golgi-localized gamma-ear-containing ARF binding protein 3 (GGA3) loss of function, due to Gga3 genetic deletion or a GGA3 rare variant that cosegregates with late-onset AD, disrupts the axonal trafficking of the beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) resulting in its accumulation in axonal swellings in cultured neurons and in vivo. We show that BACE pharmacological inhibition ameliorates BACE1 axonal trafficking and diminishes axonal dystrophies in Gga3 null neurons in vitro and in vivo. These data indicate that axonal accumulation of BACE1 engendered by GGA3 loss of function results in local toxicity leading to axonopathy. Gga3 deletion exacerbates axonal dystrophies in a mouse model of AD before beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition. Our study strongly supports a role for GGA3 in AD pathogenesis, where GGA3 loss of function triggers BACE1 axonal accumulation independently of extracellular Abeta, and initiates a cascade of events leading to the axonal damage distinctive of the early stage of AD.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine whether late-life exposure to PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters <2.5-microm) contributes to progressive brain atrophy predictive of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using a community-dwelling cohort of women (aged 70-89) with up to two brain MRI scans (MRI-1: 2005-6; MRI-2: 2010-11). METHODS: AD pattern similarity (AD-PS) scores, developed by supervised machine learning and validated with MRI data from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative, was used to capture high-dimensional gray matter atrophy in brain areas vulnerable to AD (e.g., amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus, inferior temporal lobe areas and midbrain). Based on participants' addresses and air monitoring data, we implemented a spatiotemporal model to estimate 3-year average exposure to PM2.5 preceding MRI-1. General linear models were used to examine the association between PM2.5 and AD-PS scores (baseline and 5-year standardized change), accounting for potential confounders and white matter lesion volumes. RESULTS: For 1365 women aged 77.9+-3.7 years in 2005-6, there was no association between PM2.5 and baseline AD-PS score in cross-sectional analyses (beta=-0.004; 95% CI: -0.019, 0.011). Longitudinally, each interquartile range increase of PM2.5 (2.82-microg/m3) was associated with increased AD-PS scores during the follow-up, equivalent to a 24% (hazard ratio=1.24; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.34) increase in AD risk over 5-years (n=712; aged 77.4+-3.5 years). This association remained after adjustment for socio-demographics, intracranial volume, lifestyle, clinical characteristics, and white matter lesions, and was present with levels below US regulatory standards (<12-microg/m3). CONCLUSIONS: Late-life exposure to PM2.5 is associated with increased neuroanatomical risk of AD, which may not be explained by available indicators of cerebrovascular damage.",

    "title": "Regional binding of tau and amyloid PET tracers in Down syndrome autopsy brain tissue.",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Tau pathology is a major age-related event in Down syndrome with Alzheimer's disease (DS-AD). Although recently, several different Tau PET tracers have been developed as biomarkers for AD, these tracers showed different binding properties in Alzheimer disease and other non-AD tauopathies. They have not been yet investigated in tissue obtained postmortem for DS-AD cases. Here, we evaluated the binding characteristics of two Tau PET tracers (3H-MK6240 and 3H-THK5117) and one amyloid (3H-PIB) ligand in the medial frontal gyrus (MFG) and hippocampus (HIPP) in tissue from adults with DS-AD and DS cases with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to sporadic AD. METHODS: Tau and amyloid autoradiography were performed on paraffin-embedded sections. To confirm respective ligand targets, adjacent sections were immunoreacted for phospho-Tau (AT8) and stained for amyloid staining using Amylo-Glo. RESULTS: The two Tau tracers showed a significant correlation with each other and with AT8, suggesting that both tracers were binding to Tau deposits. 3H-MK6240 Tau binding correlated with AT8 immunostaining but to a lesser degree than the 3H-THK5117 tracer, suggesting differences in binding sites between the two Tau tracers. 3H-THK5117, 3H-MK6240 and 3H-PIB displayed dense laminar binding in the HIPP and MFG in adult DS brains. A regional difference in Tau binding between adult DS and AD was observed suggesting differential regional Tau deposition in adult DS compared to AD, with higher THK binding density in the MFG in adult with DS compared to AD. No significant correlation was found between 3H-PIB and Amylo-Glo staining in adult DS brains suggesting that the amyloid PIB tracer binds to additional sites. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insights into the regional binding distribution of a first-generation and a second-generation Tau tracer in limbic and neocortical regions in adults with DS, as well as regional differences in Tau binding in adult with DS vs. those with AD. These findings provide new information about the binding properties of two Tau radiotracers for the detection of Tau pathology in adults with DS in vivo and provide valuable data regarding Tau vs. amyloid binding in adult DS compared to AD.",

METHODS: Cohort study. Event-based and dose-response Emax models were fitted to longitudinal cognitive data, to stage AD and determine the earliest ages of decline. Results informed sample size estimations for hypothetical RCTs of disease-modifying treatments that reduced decline by 35% or 75%. RESULTS: Seventy-five percent of participants progressed or remained stable in the AD staging model; effect sizes varied by age group and tests. Varied treatment effects could be detected with 50-200 people per arm when using sensitive cognitive outcome measures and targeting recruitment to ages 36 to 45 years. DISCUSSION: Efficient RCTs of AD preventative treatments can be conducted in the DS population using sensitive outcome measures to monitor early decline. Dose-response models could help tailor future RCTs.",

    "abstract": "PBT2 (5,7-dichloro-2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-8-hydroxyquinoline) is a small Cu(II)-binding drug that has been investigated in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, namely, Alzheimer's disease (AD). PBT2 is thought to be highly effective at crossing the blood-brain barrier and has been proposed to exert anti-Alzheimer's effects through the modulation of metal ion concentrations in the brain, specifically the sequestration of Cu(II) from amyloid plaques. However, despite promising initial results in animal models and in clinical trials where PBT2 was shown to improve cognitive function, larger-scale clinical trials did not find PBT2 to have a significant effect on the amyloid plaque burden compared with controls. We propose that the results of these clinical trials likely point to a more complex mechanism of action for PBT2 other than simple Cu(II) sequestration. To this end, herein we have investigated the solution chemistry of Cu(II) coordination by PBT2 primarily using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), high-energy-resolution fluorescence-detected XAS, and electron paramagnetic resonance. We propose that a novel bis-PBT2 Cu(II) complex with asymmetric coordination may coexist in solution with a symmetric four-coordinate Cu(II)-bis-PBT2 complex distorted from coplanarity. Additionally, PBT2 is a more flexible ligand than other 8HQs because it can act as both a bidentate and a tridentate ligand as well as coordinate Cu(II) in both 1:1 and 2:1 PBT2/Cu(II) complexes.",

Because Abeta peptide aggregates aggravate neuropathy and cognitive impairment for AD patients, numerous efforts have been devoted to suppressing Abeta self-assembly as a prospective AD treatment option. Here, we report Abeta-targeting, red-light-responsive carbon dots (CDs), and their therapeutic functions as a light-powered nanomodulator to spatiotemporally suppress toxic Abeta aggregation both in vitro and in vivo. Our aptamer-functionalized carbon dots (Apta@CDs) showed strong targeting ability toward Abeta42 species. Moreover, red LED irradiation induced Apta@CDs to irreversibly denature Abeta peptides, impeding the formation of beta-sheet-rich Abeta aggregates and attenuating Abeta-associated cytotoxicity. Consequently, Apta@CDs-mediated photomodualtion modality achieved effective suppression of Abeta aggregation in vivo, which significantly reduced the Abeta burden at the targeted sites in the brain of 5xFAD mice by ~40% and ~25% according to imaging and ELISA analyses, respectively. Our work demonstrates the therapeutic potential of photomodulating CDs for light-driven suppression against Abeta self-assembly and related neurotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Oligomers of the beta-amyloid peptide, Abeta, play a central role in the pathogenesis and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Trimers and higher-order oligomers composed of trimers are thought to be the most neurotoxic Abeta oligomers. To gain insights into the structure and assembly of Abeta oligomers, our laboratory has previously designed and synthesized macrocyclic peptides derived from Abeta17-23 and Abeta30-36 that fold to form beta-hairpins and assemble to form trimers. In this study, we found that mutating Phe20 to cyclohexylalanine (Cha) in macrocyclic Abeta-derived peptides promotes crystallization of an Abeta-derived peptide containing the Abeta24-29 loop (peptide 3F20Cha) and permits elucidation of its structure and assembly by X-ray crystallography. X-ray crystallography shows that peptide 3F20Cha forms a hexamer. X-ray crystallography and SDS-PAGE further show that trimer 4F20Cha, a covalently stabilized trimer derived from peptide 3F20Cha, forms a dodecamer. Size exclusion chromatography shows that trimer 4F20Cha forms higher-order assemblies in solution. Trimer 4F20Cha exhibits cytotoxicity against the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. These studies demonstrate the use of the F20Cha mutation to further stabilize oligomers of Abeta-derived peptides that contain more of the native sequence and thus better mimic the oligomers formed by full-length Abeta.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal endosomal dysfunction, the earliest known pathobiology specific to Alzheimer's disease (AD), is mediated by the aberrant activation of Rab5 triggered by APP-beta secretase cleaved C-terminal fragment (APP-betaCTF). To distinguish pathophysiological consequences specific to overactivated Rab5 itself, we activate Rab5 independently from APP-betaCTF in the PA-Rab5 mouse model. We report that Rab5 overactivation alone recapitulates diverse prodromal and degenerative features of AD. Modest neuron-specific transgenic Rab5 expression inducing hyperactivation of Rab5 comparable to that in AD brain reproduces AD-related Rab5-endosomal enlargement and mistrafficking, hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficits via accelerated AMPAR endocytosis and dendritic spine loss, and tau hyperphosphorylation via activated glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. Importantly, Rab5-mediated endosomal dysfunction induces progressive cholinergic neurodegeneration and impairs hippocampal-dependent memory. Aberrant neuronal Rab5-endosome signaling, therefore, drives a pathogenic cascade distinct from beta-amyloid-related neurotoxicity, which includes prodromal and neurodegenerative features of AD, and suggests Rab5 overactivation as a potential therapeutic target.",

Nevertheless, the identity of the CSF proteins that accumulate in the setting of defects in AD's endosomal trafficking pathway remains unknown. Here, we performed a CSF proteomic screen in mice with a neuronal-selective knockout of the core of the retromer complex VPS35, a master conductor of endosomal traffic that has been implicated in AD. We then validated three of the most relevant proteomic findings: the amino terminus of the transmembrane proteins APLP1 and CHL1, and the mid-domain of tau, which is known to be unconventionally secreted and elevated in AD. In patients with AD dementia, the concentration of amino-terminal APLP1 and CHL1 in the CSF correlated with tau and phosphorylated tau. Similar results were observed in healthy controls, where both proteins correlated with tau and phosphorylated tau and were elevated in about 70% of patients in the prodromal stages of AD. Collectively, the mouse-to-human studies suggest that retromer-dependent endosomal trafficking can regulate tau, APLP1, and CHL1 CSF concentration, informing on how AD's trafficking pathway might contribute to disease spread and how to identify its trafficking impairments in vivo.",

We determined the cross-sectional relation of sleep and 24-h activity rhythm disturbances with plasma-based biomarkers that might signal neurodegenerative disease, in 4712 middle-aged and elderly non-demented persons. Sleep and activity rhythms were measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and actigraphy. Simoa assays were used to measure plasma levels of neurofilament light chain, and additionally beta-amyloid 40, beta-amyloid 42, and total-tau. We used linear regression, adjusting for relevant confounders, and corrected for multiple testing. We found no associations of self-rated sleep, actigraphy-estimated sleep and 24-h activity rhythms with neurofilament light chain after confounder adjustment and correction for multiple testing, except for a non-linear association of self-rated time in bed with neurofilament light chain (P = 2.5*10-4). Similarly, we observed no significant associations with beta-amyloid 40, beta-amyloid 42, and total-tau after multiple testing correction. We conclude that sleep and 24-h activity rhythm disturbances were not consistently associated with neuronal damage as indicated by plasma neurofilament light chain in this population-based sample middle-aged and elderly non-demented persons. Further studies are needed to determine the associations of sleep and 24-h activity rhythm disturbances with NfL-related neuronal damage.",

This complicates the prediction of tau spreading, which may become critical for defining individualized tau-PET readouts in clinical trials. Since tau is assumed to spread throughout connected regions, we used functional connectivity to improve tau spreading predictions over Braak staging methods. We included two samples with longitudinal tau-PET from controls and AD patients. Cross-sectionally, we found connectivity of tau epicenters (i.e., regions with earliest tau) to predict estimated tau spreading sequences. Longitudinally, we found tau accumulation rates to correlate with connectivity strength to patient-specific tau epicenters. A connectivity-based, patient-centered tau spreading model improved the assessment of tau accumulation rates compared to Braak stage-specific readouts and reduced sample sizes by ~40% in simulated tau-targeting interventions. Thus, connectivity-based tau spreading models may show utility in clinical trials.",

This is especially true for markers that capture the risk of decline in pre-symptomatic stages of AD, as this would allow one to focus interventions on participants maximally at risk and at a stage prior to widespread synapse loss and neurodegeneration. Here we quantify plasma concentrations of an N-terminal fragment of tau (NT1) in a large, well-characterized cohort of clinically normal elderly who were followed longitudinally. Plasma NT1 levels at study entry (when all participants were unimpaired) were highly predictive of future cognitive decline, pathological tau accumulation, neurodegeneration, and transition to a diagnosis of MCI/AD. These predictive effects were particularly strong in participants with even modestly elevated brain beta-amyloid burden at study entry, suggesting plasma NT1 levels capture very early cognitive, pathologic and neurodegenerative changes along the AD trajectory.",

Memantine has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Both compounds accelerated the formation of a beta-sheet structure by Abeta[1-42], (+)MK-801 more rapidly than memantine, as observed in a thioflavin T fluorescence assay. The acceleration was followed by a decrease in the fluorescence signal that was not observed when the ligand was absent. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the soluble peptides in the presence and absence of (+)MK-801 demonstrated that the monomeric form did not bind (+)MK-801 and that in the presence of (+)MK-801 the concentration of the monomeric form progressively decreased. Small angle X-ray scattering confirmed that the presence of (+)MK-801 resulted in a more rapid and characteristic transition to an insoluble form. These results suggest that (+)MK-801 and memantine accelerate the transition of Abeta[1-42] and Abeta[1-40] to ThT-negative insoluble forms.",

    "title": "A Sensitive and Cost-Effective Chemiluminescence ELISA for Measurement of Amyloid-beta 1-42 Peptide in Human Plasma.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Amyloid-beta42 (Abeta42) is associated with plaque formation in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have suggested the potential utility of plasma Abeta42 levels in the diagnosis, and in longitudinal study of AD pathology. Conventional ELISAs are used to measure Abeta42 levels in plasma but are not sensitive enough to quantitate low levels. Although ultrasensitive assays like single molecule array or immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry have been developed to quantitate plasma Abeta42 levels, the high cost of instruments and reagents limit their use. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that a sensitive and cost-effective chemiluminescence (CL) immunoassay could be developed to detect low Abeta42 levels in human plasma. METHODS: We developed a sandwich ELISA using high affinity rabbit monoclonal antibody specific to Abeta42. The sensitivity of the assay was increased using CL substrate to quantitate low levels of Abeta42 in plasma. We examined the levels in plasma from 13 AD, 25 Down syndrome (DS), and 50 elderly controls. RESULTS: The measurement range of the assay was 0.25 to 500 pg/ml. The limit of detection was 1 pg/ml. All AD, DS, and 45 of 50 control plasma showed measurable Abeta42 levels. CONCLUSION: This assay detects low levels of Abeta42 in plasma and does not need any expensive equipment or reagents. It offers a preferred alternative to ultrasensitive assays. Since the antibodies, peptide, and substrate are commercially available, the assay is well suited for academic or diagnostic laboratories, and has a potential for the diagnosis of AD or in clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "In the phase 3 EPOCH trial (Clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01739348), treatment with the BACE inhibitor verubecestat failed to improve cognition in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, but was associated with reduced hippocampal volume after 78 weeks as assessed by MRI. The aims of the present exploratory analyses were to: (i) characterize the effect of verubecestat on brain volume by evaluating the time course of volumetric MRI changes for a variety of brain regions; and (ii) understand the mechanism through which verubecestat might cause hippocampal (and other brain region) volume loss by assessing its relationship to measures of amyloid, neurodegeneration, and cognition. Participants were aged 55-85 years with probable Alzheimer's disease dementia and a Mini Mental State Examination score >=15 and <=26. MRIs were obtained at baseline and at Weeks 13, 26, 52 and 78 of treatment. MRIs were segmented using Freesurfer and analysed using a tensor-based morphometry method. PET amyloid data were obtained with 18F-flutemetamol (Vizamyl ) at baseline and Week 78. Standardized uptake value ratios were generated with subcortical white matter as a reference region. Neurofilament light chain in the CSF was assessed as a biomarker of neurodegeneration. Compared with placebo, verubecestat showed increased MRI brain volume loss at Week 13 with no evidence of additional loss through Week 78. The verubecestat-related volumetric MRI loss occurred predominantly in amyloid-rich brain regions. Correlations between amyloid burden at baseline and verubecestat-related volumetric MRI reductions were not significant (r = 0.05 to 0.26, P-values > 0.27). There were no significant differences between verubecestat and placebo in changes from baseline in CSF levels of neurofilament light chain at Week 78 (increases of 7.2 and 14.6 pg/ml for verubecestat versus 19.7 pg/ml for placebo, P-values >= 0.1). There was a moderate correlation between volumetric MRI changes and cognitive decline in all groups including placebo at Week 78 (e.g. r = -0.45 to -0.55, P < 0.001 for whole brain), but the correlations were smaller at Week 13 and significant only for the verubecestat groups (e.g. r = -0.15 and -0.11, P < 0.04 for whole brain). Our results suggest that the verubecestat-associated MRI brain volume loss is not due to generalized, progressive neurodegeneration, but may be mediated by specific effects on BACE-related amyloid processes.",

We confirm the presence of four of these microglial subpopulations histologically and illustrate the utility of our data by characterizing further microglial cluster 7, enriched for genes depleted in the cortex of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Histologically, these cluster 7 microglia are reduced in frequency in AD tissue, and we validate this observation in an independent set of single nucleus data. Thus, our live human microglia identify a range of subtypes, and we prioritize one of these as being altered in AD.",

Amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) are one of the primary markers associated with this pathology. Abeta aggregates exhibit a diverse range of morphologies with distinct pathological activities. Recognition of the Abeta aggregates by using small molecule-based probes and sensors should not only enhance understanding of the underlying mechanisms of amyloid formation, but also facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies to interfere with amyloid neurotoxicity. BODIPY (boron dipyrrin) dyes are among the most versatile small molecule fluorophores. BODIPY scaffolds could be functionalized to tune their photophysical properties to the desired ranges as well as to adapt these dyes to various types of conditions and environments. Thus, BODIPY dyes could be viewed as unique platforms for the design of probes and sensors that are capable of detecting and tracking structural changes of various Abeta aggregates. This review summarizes currently available examples of BODIPY dyes that have been used to investigate conformational changes of Abeta peptides, self-assembly processes of Abeta, as well as Abeta interactions with various molecules.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta), reported as a significant constituent of drusen, was implicated in the pathophysiology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), yet the identity of the major pathogenic Abeta species in the retina has remained hitherto unclear. Here, we examined the in-vivo retinal impact of distinct supramolecular assemblies of Abeta. Fibrillar (Abeta40, Abeta42) and oligomeric (Abeta42) preparations showed clear biophysical hallmarks of amyloid assemblies. Measures of retinal structure and function were studied longitudinally following intravitreal administration of the various Abeta assemblies in rats. Electroretinography (ERG) delineated differential retinal neurotoxicity of Abeta species. Oligomeric Abeta42 inflicted the major toxic effect, exerting diminished ERG responses through 30 days post injection. A lesser degree of retinal dysfunction was noted following treatment with fibrillar Abeta42, whereas no retinal compromise was recorded in response to Abeta40 fibrils. The toxic effect of Abeta42 architectures was further reflected by retinal glial response. Fluorescence labelling of Abeta42 species was used to detect their accumulation into the retinal tissue. These results provide conceptual evidence of the differential toxicity of particular Abeta species in-vivo, and promote the mechanistic understanding of their retinal pathogenicity. Stratifying the impact of pathological Abeta aggregation in the retina may merit further investigation to decipher the pathophysiological relevance of processes of molecular self-assembly in retinal disorders.",

This overlap, in addition to the lack of consensus clinical criteria for fvAD, complicates its identification. We provide the first case report of fvAD differentiated in vivo from bvFTD using amyloid-beta and tau PET imaging. The patient, a right-handed woman, presented with forgetfulness at age 60. Cognitive testing at that time revealed mild impairments in memory, attention, and executive functions. Three years later, her family reported that she was displaying socially inappropriate behaviors, inertia, diminished social interest, and altered food preferences-the sum of which met the criteria for possible bvFTD. PET using an amyloid-beta tracer (F-AZD4694) identified diffuse amyloid plaques across the cerebral cortex. PET using a tau tracer specific for neurofibrillary tangles (F-MK6240) identified substantial tau pathology in the brain's frontal lobes. Together with the clinical findings, these images supported the diagnosis of fvAD rather than bvFTD. Considering past and emerging evidence that tau topography in Alzheimer disease (AD) matches the clinical features of AD, we discuss the potential utility of in vivo tau imaging using F-MK6240 for identifying fvAD.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation and accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides is a characteristic pathology for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although noninvasive therapies involving stimulation by electric field (EF) have been reported, the efficiency of Abeta disaggregation needs to be further improved for this strategy to be used in clinical settings. In this study, we show that an electrode based on a vertical nanowire electrode array (VNEA) is far more superior to a typical flat-type electrode in disaggregating Abeta plaques. The enhanced disaggregation efficiency of VNEA is due to the formation of high-strength local EF between the nanowires, as verified by in silico and empirical evidence. Compared with those of the flat electrode, the simulation data revealed that 19.8-fold and 8.8-fold higher EFs are generated above and between the nanowires, respectively. Moreover, empirical cyclic voltammetry data demonstrated that VNEA had a 2.7-fold higher charge capacity than the flat electrode; this is associated with the higher surface area of VNEA. The conformational transition of Abeta peptides between the beta-sheet and alpha-helix could be sensitively monitored in real time by the newly designed in situ circular dichroism instrument. This highly efficient EF-configuration of VNEA will lower the stimulation power for disaggregating the Abeta plaques, compared to that of other existing field-mediated modulation systems. Considering the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-compatibility and biocompatible strength of the EF for perturbing the Abeta aggregation, our study could pave the way for the potential use of electric stimulation devices for in vivo therapeutic application as well as scientific studies for AD.",

METHODS: In this prospective cross-sectional study, we quantified plasma Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 ratios with both routinely available ELISAs and novel SIMOA Amyblood assays, and provided a head-to-head comparison of their performances to detect cerebral amyloidosis in a nondemented elderly cohort (n = 199). Participants were stratified according to amyloid-PET status, and the performance of plasma Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 to detect cerebral amyloidosis was assessed using receiver operating characteristic analysis. We additionally investigated the correlations of plasma Abeta ratios with amyloid-PET and CSF Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, as well as platform agreement using Passing-Bablok regression and Bland-Altman analysis for both Abeta isoforms. RESULTS: ELISA and SIMOA plasma Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 detected cerebral amyloidosis with identical accuracy (ELISA: area under curve (AUC) 0.78, 95% CI 0.72-0.84; SIMOA: AUC 0.79, 95% CI 0.73-0.85), and both increased the performance of a basic demographic model including only age and APOE-epsilon4 genotype (p <= 0.02). ELISA and SIMOA had positive predictive values of respectively 41% and 36% in cognitively normal elderly and negative predictive values all exceeding 88%. Plasma Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40 correlated similarly with amyloid-PET for both platforms (Spearman rho = - 0.32, p <  0.0001), yet correlations with CSF Abeta1-42/t-tau were stronger for ELISA (rho = 0.41, p = 0.002) than for SIMOA (rho = 0.29, p = 0.03). Plasma Abeta levels demonstrated poor agreement between ELISA and SIMOA with concentrations of both Abeta1-42 and Abeta1-40 measured by SIMOA consistently underestimating those measured by ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: ELISA and SIMOA demonstrated equivalent performances in detecting cerebral amyloidosis through plasma Abeta1-42/Abeta1-40, both with high negative predictive values, making them equally suitable non-invasive prescreening tools for clinical trials by reducing the number of necessary PET scans for clinical trial recruitment.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), an epidemic growing worldwide due to no effective medical aid available in the market, is a neurological disorder. AD is known to be directly associated with the toxicity of amyloid-beta (Abeta) aggregates. In search of potent inhibitors of Abeta aggregation, Hamilton and co-workers reported an alpha-helix mimetic, ADH-31, which acts as a powerful antagonist of Abeta42 aggregation. To identify the key interactions between protein-ligand complexes and to gain insights into the inhibitory mechanism of ADH-31 against Abeta42 aggregation, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed in the present study. The MD simulations highlighted that ADH-31 showed distinct binding capabilities with residues spanning from the N-terminal to the central hydrophobic core (CHC) region of Abeta42 and restricted the conformational transition of the helix-rich structure of Abeta42 into another form of secondary structures (coil/turn/beta-sheet). Hydrophobic contacts, hydrogen bonding and pi-pi interaction contribute to the strong binding between ADH-31 and Abeta42 monomer. The Dictionary of Secondary Structure of Proteins (DSSP) analysis highlighted that the probability of helical content increases from 38.5% to 50.2% and the turn content reduces from 14.7% to 6.2% with almost complete loss of the beta-sheet structure (4.5% to 0%) in the Abeta42 monomer + ADH-31 complex. The per-residue binding free energy analysis demonstrated that Arg5, Tyr10, His14, Gln15, Lys16, Val18, Phe19 and Lys28 residues of Abeta42 are responsible for the favourable binding free energy in Abeta42 monomer + ADH-31 complex, which is consistent with the 2D HSQC NMR of the Abeta42 monomer that depicted a change in the chemical shift of residues spanning from Glu11 to Phe20 in the presence of ADH-31. The MD simulations highlighted the prevention of sampling of amyloidogenic beta-strand conformations in Abeta42 trimer in the presence of ADH-31 as well as the ability of ADH-31 to destabilize Abeta42 trimer and protofibril structures. The lower binding affinity between Abeta42 trimer chains in the presence of ADH-31 highlights the destabilization of the Abeta42 trimer structure. Overall, MD results highlighted that ADH-31 inhibited Abeta42 aggregation by constraining Abeta peptides into helical conformation and destabilized Abeta42 trimer as well as protofibril structures. The present study provides a theoretical insight into the atomic level details of the inhibitory mechanism of ADH-31 against Abeta42 aggregation as well as protofibril destabilization and could be implemented in the structure-based drug design of potent therapeutic agents for AD.",

    "abstract": "Transient ischemia is an exacerbation factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to examine the influence of amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition around the cerebral (pial) artery in terms of diameter changes in the cerebral artery during transient ischemia in AD model mice (APPNL-G-F) under urethane anesthesia. Cerebral vasculature and Abeta deposition were examined using two-photon microscopy. Cerebral ischemia was induced by transient occlusion of the unilateral common carotid artery. The diameter of the pial artery was quantitatively measured. In wild-type mice, the diameter of arteries increased during occlusion and returned to their basal diameter after re-opening. In AD model mice, the artery response during occlusion differed depending on Abeta deposition sites. Arterial diameter changes at non-Abeta deposition site were similar to those in wild-type mice, whereas they were significantly smaller at Abeta deposition site. The results suggest that cerebral artery changes during ischemia are impaired by Abeta deposition.",

    "abstract": "Mismatch between CSF and PET amyloid-beta biomarkers occurs in up to  20% of preclinical/prodromal Alzheimer's disease individuals. Factors underlying mismatching results remain unclear. In this study we hypothesized that CSF/PET discordance provides unique biological/clinical information. To test this hypothesis, we investigated non-demented and demented participants with CSF amyloid-beta42 and [18F]Florbetapir PET assessments at baseline (n = 867) and at 2-year follow-up (n = 289). Longitudinal trajectories of amyloid-beta positivity were tracked simultaneously for CSF and PET biomarkers. In the longitudinal cohort (n = 289), we found that participants with normal CSF/PET amyloid-beta biomarkers progressed more frequently toward CSF/PET discordance than to full CSF/PET positivity (chi2(1) = 5.40; p < 0.05). Progression to CSF+/PET+ status was ten times more frequent in cases with discordant biomarkers, as compared to csf-/pet- cases (chi2(1) = 18.86; p < 0.001). Compared to the CSF+/pet- group, the csf-/PET+ group had lower APOE-epsilon4epsilon4 prevalence (chi2(6) = 197; p < 0.001; n = 867) and slower rate of brain amyloid-beta accumulation (F(3,600) = 12.76; p < 0.001; n = 608). These results demonstrate that biomarker discordance is a typical stage in the natural history of amyloid-beta accumulation, with CSF or PET becoming abnormal first and not concurrently. Therefore, biomarker discordance allows for identification of individuals with elevated risk of progression toward fully abnormal amyloid-beta biomarkers, with subsequent risk of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Our results also suggest that there are two alternative pathways (\"CSF-first\" vs. \"PET-first\") toward established amyloid-beta pathology, characterized by different genetic profiles and rates of amyloid-beta accumulation. In conclusion, CSF and PET amyloid-beta biomarkers provide distinct information, with potential implications for their use as biomarkers in clinical trials.",

Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), a type of EV involved in cellular communication, have been well documented as propagating neurodegenerative diseases. These sEVs carry cargo, such as proteins and RNA, to recipient cells but are also capable of promoting protein misfolding, thus actively contributing to the progression of these diseases. sEV secretion is also a compensatory process for lysosomal dysfunction in the affected cells, despite inadvertently propagating disease to recipient cells. Despite this, sEV miRNAs have biomarker potential for the early diagnosis of these diseases, while stem cell-derived sEVs and those generated through exogenous assistance demonstrate the greatest therapeutic potential. This Review will highlight novel advancements in the involvement of sEVs as propagators of neuropathology, biomarkers and potential therapeutics in neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease with multifactorial pathologies including Abeta containing senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) consisted of aggregated Tau. Most of the AD patients are sporadic and the familial mutation hereditary patients are composed only 1% of all cases. However, the current AD mouse models employ mutated APP, PS1, or even Tau mutant, in order to display a portion of AD pathologies. Delta-secretase (legumain, or asparaginyl endopeptidase, AEP) simultaneously cleaves both APP and Tau and augments Abeta production and Tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, contributing to AD pathogenesis. Here we show that delta-secretase is sufficient to promote prominent AD pathologies in wild-type hAPP/hMAPT double transgenic mice. We crossed hAPP l5 mice and hMAPT mice to generate double transgenic mouse model carrying both human wild-type APP and Tau. Compared to the single transgenic parents, these double transgenic mice demonstrated AD-related pathologies in one-year-old hAPP/hMAPT mice. Notably, overexpression of delta-secretase in hAPP/hMAPT double-transgenic mice evidently accelerated enormous senile plaques and NFT, associated with prominent synaptic defects and cognitive deficits. Hence, delta-secretase facilitates AD pathogenesis independent of any patient-derived mutation.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Microglial TYROBP (DAP12) is a network hub and driver in sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). TYROBP is a cytoplasmic adaptor for TREM2 and other receptors, but little is known about its roles and actions in AD. Herein, we demonstrate that endogenous Tyrobp transcription is specifically increased in recruited microglia. METHODS: Using a novel transgenic mouse overexpressing TYROBP in microglia, we observed a decrease of the amyloid burden and an increase of TAU phosphorylation stoichiometry when crossed with APP/PSEN1 or MAPTP301S mice, respectively. Characterization of these mice revealed Tyrobp-related modulation of apolipoprotein E (Apoe) transcription. We also showed that Tyrobp and Apoe mRNAs were increased in Trem2-null microglia recruited around either amyloid beta deposits or a cortical stab injury. Conversely, microglial Apoe transcription was dramatically diminished when Tyrobp was absent. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that TYROBP-APOE signaling does not require TREM2 and could be an initiating step in establishment of the disease-associated microglia (DAM) phenotype.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence demonstrating the relationship between herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for relevant articles. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the qualities of these studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models. We also performed subgroup analyses stratified by apolipoprotein epsilon4 (APOE epsilon4), NOS score, and the method of confirming AD. A total of 21 studies between 1990 and 2020 were identified. The pooled OR suggested that HSV-1 infection is a risk factor of AD: pooled OR 1.40 (95% CI: 1.13-1.75; I2 = 3%, P = 0.42). In the subgroup analyses, the pooled ORs of HSV-1 infection associated with AD were 0.75 (95% CI: 0.24-2.37) among the APOE epsilon4-positive individuals; 0.85 (95% CI: 0.61-1.17) among the APOE epsilon4-negative individuals; 1.51 (95% CI: 1.10-2.06) in the high NOS score studies; 1.23 (95% CI: 0.85-1.76) in the moderate NOS score studies; 1.47 (95% CI: 1.16-1.87) in the clinical diagnosis group, and 1.20 (95% CI: 0.77-1.87) in the autopsy group. Our up-to-date systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that HSV-1 infection is a risk factor of AD.",

    "abstract": "Biological membranes can dramatically accelerate the aggregation of normally soluble protein molecules into amyloid fibrils and alter the fibril morphologies, yet the molecular mechanisms through which this accelerated nucleation takes place are not yet understood. Here, we develop a coarse-grained model to systematically explore the effect that the structural properties of the lipid membrane and the nature of protein-membrane interactions have on the nucleation rates of amyloid fibrils. We identify two physically distinct nucleation pathways-protein-rich and lipid-rich-and quantify how the membrane fluidity and protein-membrane affinity control the relative importance of those molecular pathways. We find that the membrane's susceptibility to reshaping and being incorporated into the fibrillar aggregates is a key determinant of its ability to promote protein aggregation. We then characterize the rates and the free-energy profile associated with this heterogeneous nucleation process, in which the surface itself participates in the aggregate structure. Finally, we compare quantitatively our data to experiments on membrane-catalyzed amyloid aggregation of alpha-synuclein, a protein implicated in Parkinson's disease that predominately nucleates on membranes. More generally, our results provide a framework for understanding macromolecular aggregation on lipid membranes in a broad biological and biotechnological context.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of glial activation and neuroinflammation are critical factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). YKL-40, a primarily astrocytic protein encoded by the gene Chi3l1, is a widely studied cerebrospinal fluid biomarker that increases with aging and early in AD. However, the function of Chi3l1/YKL-40 in AD is unknown. In a cohort of patients with AD, we observed that a variant in the human CHI3L1 gene, which results in decreased CSF YKL-40 expression, was associated with slower AD progression. At baseline, Chi3l1 deletion in mice had no effect on astrocyte activation while modestly promoting microglial activation. In a mouse APP/PS1 model of AD, Chi3l1 deletion decreased amyloid plaque burden and increased periplaque expression of the microglial lysosomal marker CD68, suggesting that Chi3l1 may suppress glial phagocytic activation and promote amyloid accumulation. Accordingly, Chi3l1 knockdown increased phagocytosis of zymosan particles and of beta-amyloid peptide in both astrocytes and microglia in vitro. We further observed that expression of Chi3l1 is regulated by the circadian clock, as deletion of the core clock proteins BMAL1 or CLOCK/NPAS2 strongly suppresses basal Chi3l1 expression, whereas deletion of the negative clock regulators PER1/PER2 increased Chi3l1 expression. Basal Chi3l1 mRNA was nonrhythmic because of a long mRNA half-life in astrocytes. However, inflammatory induction of Chi3l1 was gated by the clock. Our findings reveal Chi3l1/YKL-40 as a modulator of glial phagocytic activation and AD pathogenesis in both mice and humans and suggest that the astrocyte circadian clock regulates inflammatory Chi3l1 induction.",

To achieve reproducible, robust results in data-driven approaches, an evaluation of the present data landscape is vital. Methods: Previous efforts relied exclusively on metadata and literature. Here, we evaluate the data landscape by directly investigating nine patient-level data sets generated in major clinical cohort studies. Results: The investigated cohorts differ in key characteristics, such as demographics and distributions of AD biomarkers. Analyzing the ethnoracial diversity revealed a strong bias toward White/Caucasian individuals. We described and compared the measured data modalities. Finally, the available longitudinal data for important AD biomarkers was evaluated. All results are explorable through our web application ADataViewer (https://adata.scai.fraunhofer.de). Discussion: Our evaluation exposed critical limitations in the AD data landscape that impede comparative approaches across multiple data sets. Comparison of our results to those gained by metadata-based approaches highlights that thorough investigation of real patient-level data is imperative to assess a data landscape.",

    "title": "Abeta Plaques.",
    "abstract": "Abeta plaques are one of the two lesions in the brain that define the neuropathological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Plaques are highly diverse structures; many of them include massed, fibrillar polymers of the Abeta protein referred to as Abeta-amyloid, but some lack the defining features of amyloid. Cellular elements in 'classical' plaques include abnormal neuronal processes and reactive glial cells, but these are not present in all plaques. Plaques have been given various names since their discovery in 1892, including senile plaques, amyloid plaques, and neuritic plaques. However, with the identification in the 1980s of Abeta as the obligatory and universal component of plaques, the term 'Abeta plaques' has become a unifying term for these heterogeneous formations. Tauopathy, the second essential lesion of the Alzheimer's disease diagnostic dyad, is downstream of Abeta-proteopathy, but it is critically important for the manifestation of dementia. The etiologic link between Abeta-proteopathy and tauopathy in Alzheimer's disease remains largely undefined. Abeta plaques develop and propagate via the misfolding, self-assembly and spread of Abeta by the prion-like mechanism of seeded protein aggregation. Partially overlapping sets of risk factors and sequelae, including inflammation, genetic variations, and various environmental triggers have been linked to plaque development and idiopathic Alzheimer's disease, but no single factor has emerged as a requisite cause. The value of Abeta plaques per se as therapeutic targets is uncertain; although some plaques are sites of focal gliosis and inflammation, the complexity of inflammatory biology presents challenges to glia-directed intervention. Small, soluble, oligomeric assemblies of Abeta are enriched in the vicinity of plaques, and these probably contribute to the toxic impact of Abeta aggregation on the brain. Measures designed to reduce the production or seeded self-assembly of Abeta can impede the formation of Abeta plaques and oligomers, along with their accompanying abnormalities; given the apparent long timecourse of the emergence, maturation and proliferation of Abeta plaques in humans, such therapies are likely to be most effective when begun early in the pathogenic process, before significant damage has been done to the brain. Since their discovery in the late 19th century, Abeta plaques have, time and again, illuminated fundamental mechanisms driving neurodegeneration, and they should remain at the forefront of efforts to understand, and therefore treat, Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Circulating Insulin-Like Growth Factor I is Involved in the Effect of High Fat Diet on Peripheral Amyloid beta Clearance.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but underlying mechanisms are not clear. We analyzed peripheral clearance of amyloid beta (Abeta) in overweight mice because its systemic elimination may impact brain Abeta load, a major landmark of AD pathology. We also analyzed whether circulating insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) intervenes in the effects of overweight as this growth factor modulates brain Abeta clearance and is increased in the serum of overweight mice. Overweight mice showed increased Abeta accumulation by the liver, the major site of elimination of systemic Abeta, but unaltered brain Abeta levels. We also found that Abeta accumulation by hepatocytes is stimulated by IGF-I, and that mice with low serum IGF-I levels show reduced liver Abeta accumulation-ameliorated by IGF-I administration, and unchanged brain Abeta levels. In the brain, IGF-I favored the association of its receptor (IGF-IR) with the Abeta precursor protein (APP), and at the same time, stimulated non-amyloidogenic processing of APP in astrocytes, as indicated by an increased sAPPalpha/sAPPbeta ratio after IGF-I treatment. Since serum IGF-I enters into the brain in an activity-dependent manner, we analyzed in overweight mice the effect of brain activation by environmental enrichment (EE) on brain IGF-IR phosphorylation and its association to APP, as a readout of IGF-I activity. After EE, significantly reduced brain IGF-IR phosphorylation and APP/IGF-IR association were found in overweight mice as compared to lean controls. Collectively, these results indicate that a high-fat diet influences peripheral clearance of Abeta without affecting brain Abeta load. Increased serum IGF-I likely contributes to enhanced peripheral Abeta clearance in overweight mice, without affecting brain Abeta load probably because its brain entrance is reduced.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We evaluated Abeta misfolding in combination with Abeta42/40 ratio as a prognostic tool for future clinical progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). METHODS: Baseline plasma samples (n = 203) from SCD subjects in the SCIENCe project and Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (age 61 +- 9 years; 57% male, mean follow-up time 2.7 years) were analyzed using immuno-infrared-sensor technology. Within 6 years of follow-up, 22 (11%) individuals progressed to MCI or dementia due to AD. Sensor readout values > 1646 cm- 1 reflected normal Abeta folding; readouts at <= 1646 cm- 1 reflected low and at < 1644 cm- 1 high misfolding. We used Cox proportional hazard models to quantify Abeta misfolding as a prognostic biomarker for progression to MCI and dementia due to AD. The accuracy of the predicted development of MCI/AD was determined by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (t-ROC) curve analyses that take individual follow-up and conversion times into account. Statistical models were adjusted for age, sex, and APOEepsilon4 status. Additionally, plasma Abeta42/40 data measured by SIMOA were statistically analyzed and compared. RESULTS: All 22 patients who converted to MCI or AD-dementia within 6 years exhibited Abeta misfolding at baseline. Cox analyses revealed a hazard ratio (HR) of 19 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.2-157.8) for future conversion of SCD subjects with high misfolding and of 11 (95% CI 1.0-110.1) for those with low misfolding. T-ROC curve analyses yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 (95% CI 0.86-1.00; 6-year follow-up) for Abeta misfolding in an age, sex, and APOEepsilon4 model. A similar model with plasma Abeta42/40 ratio yielded an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.82-1.00). The AUC increased to 0.99 (95% CI, 0.99-1.00) after inclusion of both Abeta misfolding and the Abeta42/40 ratio. CONCLUSIONS: A panel of structure- and concentration-based plasma amyloid biomarkers may predict conversion to clinical MCI and dementia due to AD in cognitively unimpaired subjects. These plasma biomarkers provide a noninvasive and cost-effective alternative for screening early AD pathological changes. Follow-up studies and external validation in larger cohorts are in progress for further validation of our findings.",

METHODS: In a cohort of 335 older adults, ranging in cognitive functioning, we estimated the time of initial changes of Abeta, tau, and decreases in cognition with respect to the time of Abeta-positivity. RESULTS: Small effect sizes of change in CSF Abeta42 and regional Abeta PET were estimated to occur several decades before Abeta-positivity. Increases in CSF tau occurred 7-8 years before Abeta-positivity. Temporoparietal tau PET showed increases 4-5 years before Abeta-positivity. Subtle cognitive dysfunction was observed 4-6 years before Abeta-positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in tau and cognitive dysfunction occur years before commonly used thresholds for Abeta-positivity.

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related degenerative decline is associated to the presence of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaque lesions and neuro fibrillary tangles (NFT). However, the precise molecular mechanisms linking Abeta deposition and neurological decline are still unclear. Here we combine genome-wide transcriptional profiling of the insular cortex of 3xTg-AD mice and control littermates from early through to late adulthood (2-14 months of age), with behavioral and biochemical profiling in the same animals to identify transcriptional determinants of functional decline specifically associated to build-up of Abeta deposits. Differential expression analysis revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the cortex long before observed onset of behavioral symptoms in this model. Using behavioral and biochemical data derived from the same mice and samples, we found that down but not up-regulated DEGs show a stronger average association with learning performance than random background genes in control not seen in AD mice. Conversely, these same genes were found to have a stronger association with Abeta deposition than background genes in AD but not in control mice, thereby identifying these genes as potential intermediaries between abnormal Abeta/NFT deposition and functional decline. Using a complementary approach, gene ontology analysis revealed a highly significant enrichment of learning and memory, associative, memory, and cognitive functions only among down-regulated, but not up-regulated, DEGs. Our results demonstrate wider transcriptional changes triggered by the abnormal deposition of Abeta/NFT occurring well before behavioral decline and identify a distinct set of genes specifically associated to abnormal Abeta protein deposition and cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Defining a signature of cortical regions of interest preferentially affected by Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology may offer improved sensitivity to early AD compared to hippocampal volume or mesial temporal lobe alone. Since late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) participants tend to have age-related comorbidities, the younger-onset age in autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) may provide a more idealized model of cortical thinning in AD. To test this, the goals of this study were to compare the degree of overlap between the ADAD and LOAD cortical thinning maps and to evaluate the ability of the ADAD cortical signature regions to predict early pathological changes in cognitively normal individuals. We defined and analyzed the LOAD cortical maps of cortical thickness in 588 participants from the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (Knight ADRC) and the ADAD cortical maps in 269 participants from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN) observational study. Both cohorts were divided into three groups: cognitively normal controls (nADRC = 381; nDIAN = 145), preclinical (nADRC = 153; nDIAN = 76), and cognitively impaired (nADRC = 54; nDIAN = 48). Both cohorts underwent clinical assessments, 3T MRI, and amyloid PET imaging with either 11C-Pittsburgh compound B or 18F-florbetapir. To generate cortical signature maps of cortical thickness, we performed a vertex-wise analysis between the cognitively normal controls and impaired groups within each cohort using six increasingly conservative statistical thresholds to determine significance. The optimal cortical map among the six statistical thresholds was determined from a receiver operating characteristic analysis testing the performance of each map in discriminating between the cognitively normal controls and preclinical groups. We then performed within-cohort and cross-cohort (e.g. ADAD maps evaluated in the Knight ADRC cohort) analyses to examine the sensitivity of the optimal cortical signature maps to the amyloid levels using only the cognitively normal individuals (cognitively normal controls and preclinical groups) in comparison to hippocampal volume. We found the optimal cortical signature maps were sensitive to early increases in amyloid for the asymptomatic individuals within their respective cohorts and were significant beyond the inclusion of hippocampus volume, but the cortical signature maps performed poorly when analyzing across cohorts. These results suggest the cortical signature maps are a useful MRI biomarker of early AD-related neurodegeneration in preclinical individuals and the pattern of decline differs between LOAD and ADAD.",

    "abstract": "Study objectives: To investigate the extent to which sleep quality associated with plasma Abeta levels in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) elderly. Methods: A total of 172 cognitively normal (NC) elderly and 133 aMCI elderly were included in this study. For the evaluation of sleep quality, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used. Levels of plasma Abeta were determined by the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Multivariable linear regression analysis was applied to evaluate associations between sleep quality and plasma Abeta levels after adjusting potential confounders. Results: Compared to NC subjects, participants with aMCI had a higher global PSQI score (8.72 +- 3.87 vs. 7.10 +- 3.07, p < 0.001). The global PSQI score was positively associated with plasma Abeta42 level in the aMCI group (beta = 0.063, 95% CI 0.001-0.125, and p = 0.049) but not in the NC group (p > 0.05). Additionally, a higher global PSQI score was associated with a higher plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio in both NC (beta = 0.010, 95% CI 0.003-0.016, and p = 0.003) and aMCI groups (beta = 0.012, 95% CI 0.005-0.018, and p < 0.001). The association between global PSQI score and plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio was stronger in individuals with aMCI relative to the NC subjects (beta = 0.076 vs. 0.030, p for interaction = 0.023). Conclusion: Poor sleep quality was associated with plasma Abeta42 and Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio, with a stronger effect among individuals with aMCI. A better understanding of the role of sleep in plasma Abeta levels in aMCI patients could lead to effective sleep-based intervention against the risk of Alzheimer's disease.",

    "title": "Natural Compounds as Inhibitors of Abeta Peptide Aggregation: Chemical Requirements and Molecular Mechanisms.",
    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, with no cure and preventive therapy. Misfolding and extracellular aggregation of Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are recognized as the main cause of AD progression, leading to the formation of toxic Abeta oligomers and to the deposition of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain, representing the hallmarks of AD. Given the urgent need to provide alternative therapies, natural products serve as vital resources for novel drugs. In recent years, several natural compounds with different chemical structures, such as polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenes, flavonoids, tannins, saponins and vitamins from plants have received attention for their role against the neurodegenerative pathological processes. However, only for a small subset of them experimental evidences are provided on their mechanism of action. This review focuses on those natural compounds shown to interfere with Abeta aggregation by direct interaction with Abeta peptide and whose inhibitory mechanism has been investigated by means of biophysical and structural biology experimental approaches. In few cases, the combination of approaches offering a macroscopic characterization of the oligomers, such as TEM, AFM, fluorescence, together with high-resolution methods could shed light on the complex mechanism of inhibition. In particular, solution NMR spectroscopy, through peptide-based and ligand-based observation, was successfully employed to investigate the interactions of the natural compounds with both soluble NMR-visible (monomer and low molecular weight oligomers) and NMR-invisible (high molecular weight oligomers and protofibrils) species. The molecular determinants of the interaction of promising natural compounds are here compared to infer the chemical requirements of the inhibitors and the common mechanisms of inhibition. Most of the data converge to indicate that the Abeta regions relevant to perturb the aggregation cascade and regulate the toxicity of the stabilized oligomers, are the N-term and beta1 region. The ability of the natural aggregation inhibitors to cross the brain blood barrier, together with the tactics to improve their low bioavailability are discussed. The analysis of the data ensemble can provide a rationale for the selection of natural compounds as molecular scaffolds for the design of new therapeutic strategies against the progression of early and late stages of AD.",

    "title": "Ionic Environment Affects Biomolecular Interactions of Amyloid-beta: SPR Biosensor Study.",
    "abstract": "In early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid beta (Abeta) accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix and interacts with mitochondrial proteins, such as cyclophilin D (cypD) and 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 10 (17beta-HSD10). Multiple processes associated with AD such as increased production or oligomerization of Abeta affect these interactions and disbalance the equilibrium between the biomolecules, which contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we investigate the effect of the ionic environment on the interactions of Abeta (Abeta1-40, Abeta1-42) with cypD and 17beta-HSD10 using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor. We show that changes in concentrations of K+ and Mg2+ significantly affect the interactions and may increase the binding efficiency between the biomolecules by up to 35% and 65% for the interactions with Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42, respectively, in comparison with the physiological state. We also demonstrate that while the binding of Abeta1-40 to cypD and 17beta-HSD10 takes place preferentially around the physiological concentrations of ions, decreased concentrations of K+ and increased concentrations of Mg2+ promote the interaction of both mitochondrial proteins with Abeta1-42. These results suggest that the ionic environment represents an important factor that should be considered in the investigation of biomolecular interactions taking place in the mitochondrial matrix under physiological as well as AD-associated conditions.",

    "title": "The accumulation rate of tau aggregates is higher in females and younger amyloid-positive subjects.",
    "abstract": "The development of tau-PET allows paired helical filament tau pathology to be visualized in vivo. Increased knowledge about conditions affecting the rate of tau accumulation could guide the development of therapies halting the progression of Alzheimer's disease. However, the factors modifying the rate of tau accumulation over time in Alzheimer's disease are still largely unknown. Large-scale longitudinal cohort studies, adjusting for baseline tau load, are needed to establish such risk factors. In the present longitudinal study, 419 participants from four cohorts in the USA (Avid 05e, n = 157; Expedition-3, n = 82; ADNI, n = 123) and Sweden (BioFINDER, n = 57) were scanned repeatedly with tau-PET. The study participants were cognitively unimpaired (n = 153), or patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 139) or Alzheimer's disease dementia (n = 127). Participants underwent two to four tau-PET (18F-flortaucipir) scans with a mean (+- standard deviation) of 537 (+-163) days between the first and last scan. The change in tau-PET signal was estimated in temporal meta- and neocortical regions of interest. Subject specific tau-PET slopes were predicted simultaneously by age, sex, amyloid status (determined by amyloid-beta PET), APOE epsilon4 genotype, study cohort, diagnosis and baseline tau load. We found that accelerated increase in tau-PET signal was observed in amyloid-beta-positive mild cognitive impairment (3.0 +- 5.3%) and Alzheimer's disease dementia (2.9 +- 5.7%), respectively, when compared to either amyloid-beta-negative cognitively unimpaired (0.4 +- 2.7%), amyloid-beta-negative mild cognitive impairment (-0.4 +- 2.3%) or amyloid-beta-positive cognitively unimpaired (1.2 +- 2.8%). Tau-PET uptake was accelerated in females (temporal region of interest: t = 2.86, P = 0.005; neocortical region of interest: t = 2.90, P = 0.004), younger individuals (temporal region of interest: t = -2.49, P = 0.013), and individuals with higher baseline tau-PET signal (temporal region of interest: t = 3.83, P < 0.001; neocortical region of interest: t = 5.01, P < 0.001). Tau-PET slopes decreased with age in amyloid-beta-positive subjects, but were stable by age in amyloid-beta-negative subjects (age x amyloid-beta status interaction: t = -2.39, P = 0.018). There were no effects of study cohort or APOE epsilon4 positivity. In a similar analysis on longitudinal amyloid-beta-PET (in ADNI subjects only, n = 639), we found significant associations between the rate of amyloid-beta accumulation and APOE epsilon4 positivity, older age and baseline amyloid-beta positivity, but no effect of sex. In conclusion, in this longitudinal PET study comprising four cohorts, we found that the tau accumulation rate is greater in females and younger amyloid-beta-positive individuals, while amyloid-beta accumulation is greater in APOE epsilon4 carriers and older individuals. These findings are important considerations for the design of clinical trials, and might improve our understanding of factors associated with faster tau aggregation and spread.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting the elderly at a high incidence. AD is of unknown etiology and currently, no cure is available. Present medication is restricted to treating symptoms; thus, a need exists for the development of effective remedies. Medicinal plants constitute a large pool, from which active compounds of great pharmaceutical potential can be derived. Various Salvia spp. are considered as neuroprotective, and here, the ability of Salvia fruticosa (SF) to protect against toxic effects induced in an AD cell model was partly assessed. Two of AD's characteristic hallmarks are the presence of elevated oxidative stress levels and the cytotoxic aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides. Thus, we obtained SF extracts in three different solvents of increasing polarity, consecutively, to evaluate (a) their antioxidant capacity with the employment of the free radical scavenging assay (DPPH ), of the ferric reducing ability of plasma assay (FRAP), and of the cellular reactive oxygen species assay (DCFDA) and (b) their neuroprotective properties against Abeta 25-35-induced cell death with the use of an MTT assay. All three SF extracts showed a considerable antioxidant capacity, with the methanol (SFM) extract being the strongest. The results of the total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPC and TFC) of the extracts and of the FRAP and the DCFDA assays showed a similar pattern. In addition, and most importantly, the dichloromethane (SFD) and the petroleum ether (SFP) extracts had an effect on Abeta toxicity, exhibiting a significant neuroprotective potential. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SF extracts demonstrating neuroprotective potential against Abeta toxicity. In combination with their antioxidant capacity, SF extracts may be beneficial in combating AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a major neurodegenerative illness whose prevalence is increasing worldwide but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. There is some scientific evidence that the molecular complexity of Alzheimer's pathophysiology is associated with the formation of extracellular amyloid-beta plaques in the brain. A novel cross- phenotype association analysis of imaging genetics reported a brain atrophy susceptibility gene, namely FAM222A and the protein Aggregatin encoded by FAM222A interacts with amyloid-beta (A?)-peptide (1-42) through its N-terminal A? binding domain and facilitates A? aggregation. The function of Aggregatin protein is unknown, and its three-dimensional structure has not been analyzed experimentally yet. Our goal was to investigate the interaction of Aggregatin with A? in detail by in silico analysis, including the 3D structure prediction analysis of Aggregatin protein by homology modeling. Our analysis verified the interaction of the C-terminal domain of model protein with the N-terminal domain of A?. This is the first attempt to demonstrate the interaction of Aggregatin with the A?. These results confirmed in vitro and in vivo study reports claiming FAM222A helping to ease the aggregating of the A?-peptide.",

We describe here the use of a graphene-gold hybrid plasmonic platform that enables quantitative SERS measurement. Quantification is enabled by normalizing analyte peak intensities to that of the graphene G peak. We show that two complementary quantification modes are intrinsic features of the platform, and that through their combined use, the platform enables accurate determination of analyte concentration over a concentration range spanning seven orders of magnitude. We demonstrate, using a biologically relevant test analyte, the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), a seminal pathologic agent of Alzheimer's disease (AD), that linear relationships exist between (a) peak intensity and concentration at a single plasmonic hot spot smaller than 100 nm, and (b) frequency of hot spots with observable protein signals, i.e. the co-location of an Abeta protein and a hot spot. We demonstrate the detection of Abeta at a concentration as low as 10-18 M after a single 20 mul aliquot of the analyte onto the hybrid platform. This detection sensitivity can be improved further through multiple applications of analyte to the platform and by rastering the laser beam with smaller step sizes.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers, particularly low molecular weight (LMW) oligomers, rather than fibrils, contribute very significantly to the onset and progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, due to the inherent heterogeneity and metastability of oligomers, most of the conventional anti-oligomer therapies have indirectly modulated oligomers' toxicity through manipulating Abeta self-assembly to reduce oligomer levels, which are prone to suffering from the risk of regenerating toxic oligomers from the products of modulation. To circumvent this disadvantage, we demonstrate, for the first time, rational design of rigid pincer-like scaffold-based small molecules with blood-brain barrier permeability that specifically co-assemble with LMW Abeta oligomers through directly binding to the exposed hydrophobic regions of oligomers to form non-fibrillar, degradable, non-toxic co-aggregates. As a proof of concept, treatment with a europium complex (EC) in such a structural mode can rescue Abeta-mediated dysfunction in C. elegans models of AD in vivo. This small molecule-mediated oligomer co-assembly strategy offers an efficient approach for AD treatment.",
