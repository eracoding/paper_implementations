    "Read the following summary, answer the following question.\nSummary: Abeta is a protein that accumulates in the brain in people with Alzheimer's disease. It is thought to be toxic to neurons and may contribute to the development of memory loss and other symptoms of the disease.\nQuestion: predict the relationship between gene entity \"Abeta\" and disease entity \"AD\", please choose from the following options: A.downregulates\nB.associates\nC.upregulates\nD.no-relation\nE.others, please specify by generating a short predicate in 5 words\nAnswer: Let think step by step, 1. Abeta may contribute to the development of memory loss and other symptoms of the disease. 2. So the relationship between Abeta and AD should be \"Abeta upregulates AD\". So the answer is: C. upregulates",
    "Read the following summary, answer the following question.\nSummary: Chalcones are a class of compounds that have been shown to have potential therapeutic effects in Alzheimer's disease. They have been shown to be able to disaggregate amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity.\nQuestion: predict the relationship between compound entity \"chalcones\" and disease entity \"AD\", please choose from the following options: A.treats\nB.palliates\nC.no-relation\nD.others, please specify by generating a short predicate in 5 words\nAnswer: Let think step by step, 1. Chalcones are a class of compounds that have been shown to have potential therapeutic effects in Alzheimer's disease. 2. So the relationship between chalcones and AD should be \"Chalcones treat AD\". So the answer is: A. treat",
    "Read the following summary, answer the following question.\nSummary: Thioflavin T is a fluorescent dye used to detect amyloid fibrils. It is used in assays to screen for compounds that inhibit or activate amyloid fibril formation.\nQuestion: predict the relationship between compound entity \"Thioflavin T\" and disease entity \"AD\", please choose from the following options: A.treats\nB.palliates\nC.no-relation\nD.others, please specify by generating a short predicate in 5 words\nAnswer: Let think step by step, 1. Thioflavin T is used in assays to screen for compounds that inhibit or activate amyloid fibril formation. 2. Amyloid fibril formation is associated with a number of debilitating systemic and neurodegenerative diseases. 3. AD is a kind of neurodegenerative disease. So the relationship between Thioflavin T and AD should be \"Thioflavin T detects AD\". So the answer is: D. detects.",
    "Read the following summary, answer the following question.\nSummary: 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) is a radiotracer used in positron emission tomography (PET) to measure fibrillary amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease.\nQuestion: predict the relationship between compound entity \"11C-Pittsburgh\" and gene entity \"Abeta\", please choose from the following options: A.binds,\nB.upregulates\nC.downregulates\n.D.no-relation\nE.others, please specify by generating a short predicate in 5 words\nAnswer: Let think step by step, 1. The summary doesn't contain any specific information to prove there is any relationship between 11C-Pittsburgh and Abeta. 2. So the relationship between 11C-Pittsburgh and Abeta should be \"no-relation\". So the answer is: D. no-relation"
